# Lionsberg Battle Rhythm

The Lionsberg Battle Rhythm is the systematic cadence of communications, meetings, rhythms, and rituals that keep us aligned as we Progress along the Way towards The Goal. 

We intend for this rhythm to continuously improve through [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. After [[The Great Refounding]] occurs (target ~2033), this nomenclature will evolve to the Lionsberg Community Rhythm. 

The current Lionsberg Battle Rhythm is: 

## Community Assemblies 

Wednesday 12:00 PT - [[Lionsberg International Assembly]] 

Thursday 10:00 PT - Lionsberg Africa Assembly 

TBD - Lionsberg South America Assembly 

## Informal Opportunities to Connect 

Friday 12:00 PT - [[Lionsberg Coffee House]] 

## Group Assemblies  

Organized by each Group, and visible to group [[Members]] on the Lionsberg Platform.
