# Lionsberg Battle Rhythm

The Lionsberg Battle Rhythm is the systematic cadence of communications, meetings, rhythms, and rituals that keep us aligned as we Progress along the Way towards The Goal. 

We intend for this rhythm to continuously improve through [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. After [[The Great Refounding]] occurs (target ~2033), this nomenclature will evolve to the Lionsberg Community Rhythm. 

The current Lionsberg Battle Rhythm is: 

## Community Assemblies 

Mondays 10AM PT - [[Lionsberg Program Management Meeting]]

Wednesday 12:00 PT - [[Lionsberg International Assembly]] 

Thursday 10:00 PT - [[Lionsberg Africa Assembly]] 

TBD - [[Lionsberg South America Assembly]] 

## Informal Opportunities to Connect 

Friday 12:00 PT - [[Lionsberg Coffee House]] 

## Group Assemblies  

The vast majority of the [[Work]] will be accomplished through the distributed network of autonomous [[Groups]]. 

Group Assemblies will be organized by each Group, and visible to Group Participants on the Lionsberg Platform. 

Group Work will be integrated and aligned through the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]]. The Project Manager for each Group will be trained on the Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System.
