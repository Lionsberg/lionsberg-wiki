# Fractal


___

The fractal nature of the New Vision and Plan means that the same principles, values, goals, and strategies that guide the implementation of the plan at the global level also guide the implementation of the plan at the regional, national, and local levels. Each fractal [[Instance]] of the New Vision and Plan is designed to be self-sufficient and self-governing to the extent possible, while also being connected to and supported by the larger network.

To ensure that each fractal instance can continue to follow the pattern language of the New Vision and Plan, even if disconnected from the network for an extended period of time, several measures can be taken.

First, a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices should be developed and disseminated to each fractal instance of the plan. These guidelines should be based on the principles, values, goals, and strategies that guide the implementation of the plan, and they should be designed to be adaptable to a wide range of different contexts and circumstances.

Second, a robust system of training and capacity building should be developed to ensure that key leaders and practitioners in each fractal instance have the knowledge and skills they need to implement the plan effectively. This should include not only technical training, but also leadership, governance, and management training.

Third, a system of ongoing communication and feedback should be established to facilitate the sharing of information, resources, and best practices among the different fractal instances of the plan. This can be done through various means such as regular meetings, webinars, teleconferences and other digital communication tools.

Fourth, a continuity of leadership and management will be key for ensuring each fractal instance can continue to follow the New Vision and Plan even if disconnected from the network for an extended period of time. This can be achieved through a combination of succession planning, cross-training, and a strong sense of shared ownership. This continuity of leadership can be supported by regular review, evaluation and assessment of the plan.

By following these measures, the New Vision and Plan will be designed to be robust, resilient, and adaptable, allowing it to continue to be implemented successfully even in the face of unexpected disruptions or challenges.
