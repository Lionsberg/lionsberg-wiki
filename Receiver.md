# Receiver

When a System goes so far off the rails that it is determined that it is no longer capable of guiding and managing itself towards its [[Purpose]] and [[Goal]], legal precedent allows for the appointment of a [[Receiver]]. 

The role of the Receiver is generally to serve as a neutral party who will act as a [[Steward]] or [[Custodian]] and oversee the affairs of a party for the right and fair benefit of its various stakeholders. 

This role is meant to protect the domain and assets in question from further deterioration while a just and fair process unfolds. 

The role of the [[Receiver]] is designed to preserve the rights and assets of all parties and ensure an equitable outcome for [[All]] involved. 

Often, the Receiver is responsible for overseeing the Operations and Processes of the entity in question, collecting income, paying expenses, and otherwise managing the affairs of the entity under receivership. 

The Receiver also is often tasked with facilitating the resolution of disputes among various stakeholders, forging a [[New Order]] out of the [[Chaos]] of the past, and then handing the regenerated and restored entity back over to its long term stakeholders. 

The [[Human System]] is off track enough that a [[Receiver]] is warranted.
