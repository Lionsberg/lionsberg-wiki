# Navigation Issue

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[Navigation Issue]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point to the Truth that from [[Where We Are]]... 

...it is possible for things to get a loss worse, approaching the [[Hell On Earth]]... 

...and it is possible for things to get a lot better, approaching [[Heaven On Earth]]. 

What helps us Navigate away from [[Hell]] and towards [[Heaven]] is our system of [[Self Governance]].
