# Waking Up, Paying Attention, And Listening

Hearing the still small voice beckoning us [[Beyond]] [[The Old]] and into [[The New]] requires waking up, paying attention, and listening to [[Word of God]]. 

From Isaiah: 

*"Who among you will give ear to this,
who will attend and listen for the time to come?"*

"*Assemble, all of you, and listen!*"

"*Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up.*"

"*Awake, awake, put on your strength.*"

"*Shake yourself from the dust and arise;
be seated.*"

"*Incline your ear, and come to me;
hear, that your soul may live;
and I will make with you an everlasting covenant.*"

*"Seek the LORD while he may be found;
call upon him while he is near."*

*Cry aloud; do not hold back;
lift up your voice like a trumpet;
declare to my people their transgression.*  

There is a voice crying out in the wilderness, longing to be heard. 

Wake up!
