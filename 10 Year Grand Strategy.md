# 10 Year Grand Strategy

The 10 Year Grand Strategy can be thought of in two phases. 

Phase I encompasses [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], during which All human beings will be invited by someone they know and [[Trust]] to [[Join Us]]. 

Our experience is that it takes about 3 years of healing, collaborating and transforming until Individuals feel fully free, empowered, and self-governing. 

The 10 Year Grand Strategy will therefore be complete about 3 years after the last Individual who so desires to do so Joins Us. We call this the [[The 3 Year Lag]]. 

Because this kind of a Movement would be unprecedented in human history, the 10 Year Grand Strategy encompassing [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] and [[The 3 Year Lag]] is coupled to a [[20 Year Generational Contingency]]. 

It is more fully reflected in [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]].
