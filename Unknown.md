# Unknown
The Unknown stands in contrast to the [[Known]]. 

It can be thought of as the what lies outside the Territory that we have mapped and mastered. It is What Lies Beyond The Boundary. 

In [[The Book of LIONSBERGx]], the [[Known]] and [[Unknown]] are represented as Domains separated by a fortified [[Boundary]], with a [[Gate Of Knowledge]] that allows Beings to conditionally pass back and forth.
