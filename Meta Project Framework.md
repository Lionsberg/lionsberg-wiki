# Meta Project Framework

Based on the [[Meta Idea]] that [[All]] human endeavor could be viewed as a single [[Program of Action]], the idea was conceived of a conceptual overarching and uniting [[Meta Project]]. 

This [[Word Tool]] could be used as one of many ways to orient individual and local Actors to the single overarching and uniting program of action that all humanity was engaged in.

This framework was a way to conceptualize all we must _do_ together.
