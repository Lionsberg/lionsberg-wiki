# 1.4 Life as a Sovereign, Autonomous Agent

While the [[Power Structures]] of the [[Old World]] were exceptionally effective at keeping everyone divided, conquered, siloed, and optimally disempowered, the universe of [[LIONSBERG]] is different. 

In the Sovereignty of LIONSBERG, every conscious agent eternally becomes ever more [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]] and [[Free]]. We sometimes call this [[Holofractal Sovereignty]], a concept closely associated with [[Conscious Agency]]. 

The [[Pattern Language]] of the [[New World]] calls for individual and local self-governance, agency, and flourishing, in the context of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that actually enables the [[New Civilization]] we are co-creating to work. We progress on our [[Quest]] towards that [[Destiny]] through our [[Practice]] of progressively understanding and embodying that reality. 

**This means that you have no "manager". No "boss". No external Authority but [[ONE]] and [[All]].** No accountability except to the Creator, All Creation, and those who you voluntarily choose to collaborate with towards shared [[Goals]] and [[Values]]. 

Your life, your groups, your community, your bioregion, your world, and Lionsberg as a Whole are All yours to navigate towards [[The Goal]]. 

Your role therefore is to continually discern what [[ONE]] and [[All]] desire and intend, that is uniquely yours to do, that no one else is doing in your time and place. Then [[Form A Circle]], [[Choose A Quest]], and get into the next cycle of Wise Right action. 

And as you Move and Progress towards [[The Goal]], remember that because [[Out Here]] we are [[All]] responsible and empowered to steer this shared [[Vessel]] towards [[Destiny]], the most important thing you can ever do is help those around you become every more capable of skillfully navigating Together towards [[The Goal]]. Navigation towards [[The Goal]] is the essence of [[Governance]].  

While every individual and group is Sovereign and Free, if we do not wisely collaborate to [[Navigate]] [[The Vessel]] towards [[The Goal]] in a Spirit of Unity, Harmony, Coherence, and Love we will tear it apart and find our Selves once again divided, conquered, and enslaved. 

This means that we must balance our Liberty with the pragmatic necessity of functionally and effectively organizing ourselves in [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] as [[ONE Bodyx]] that can actually meet needs, solve problems, accomplish goals, and [[Progress]] on [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]].
