# The Golden Seed

The Golden Seed is a [[Metaphor]] that touches back to the parable told by Jesus, which compared the [[Kingdom of God]] to a mustard seed, which although tiny, grew into a large tree, in which all the creatures found rest, shelter, and abundance. 

In the context of Lionsberg, it is associated with [[The Tree]], the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], and the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]]. 

The Golden Seed contains within it the [[Metaphysical DNA]] that brings forth [[Heaven On Earth]].
