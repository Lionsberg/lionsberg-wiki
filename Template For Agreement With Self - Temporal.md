# Template For Agreement With Self - Temporal

This template assists you in establishing specific, short-term goals and milestones that support the transformative journey outlined in your **Eternal Agreement with Self**. Use this template to create actionable commitments and strategies for personal growth and development in alignment with your higher self. We recommend as a starting point doing a [[Retrospective]] and making a new Temporal Agreement with your Self each Quarter. 

**Instructions:**

-   Reflect on your current life situation, [[Where You Are]], and [[How You Got Here]]   
-   Reflect on [[Where You Are Going]], and the short-term goals you wish to achieve to [[Progress]] 
-   Identify the [[Steps]] and [[Milestones]] necessary to reach those [[Goals]]. We recommend focusing on no more than 3 goals per quarter. 
-   Outline a plan for monitoring progress and adjusting as needed
-   Commit to regular reviews and updates of your Temporal Agreement, and use your Quarterly agreement to inform your monthly, weekly, and daily plans.
