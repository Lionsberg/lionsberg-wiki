# LIONSBERG Integrated Delivery System

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System (Lionsberg IDS) is Way for individuals, organizations, and communities to transform their energy and action into a _Goal Delivery System._ 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System (IDS) is a revolutionary approach to delivering projects and initiatives within a global ecosystem of aligned organizations and communities. This system is designed to integrate the efforts of individuals, teams, organizations, and communities towards shared Vision and Values, and to help everyone work together effectively towards that vision across generations.

The Lionsberg IDS is based on the principle of "Everything is a Project," which means that all work done within the system is treated as a project, no matter its size or scope. This standard allows for all work done across the distributed team of teams to be stacked up and aligned into a single System Wide Master Plan and System Wide Program of Action that can be planned, executed, measured, and resourced in stride by a distributed global [[Team of Teams]]. 

The Lionsberg IDS is not a top-down approach to planning and delivery, but rather is guided from the "top" by only by Vision and Strategy, while being informed from the bottom up based on the total set of projects and initiatives being generated by the distributed Team of Teams to progress towards shared goals and values. This allows the system to be highly flexible and responsive to the changing needs and priorities of the organizations and communities it serves.

The Lionsberg IDS is designed to be highly collaborative, with teams working together across organizational and functional boundaries to achieve shared goals and objectives. The system encourages open and transparent communication, and helps to build trust and collaboration among individuals, teams, organizations, and communities around the world. 

The Lionsberg IDS is also designed to be highly adaptable, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities at local, regional, and global levels. The system provides guidelines and best practices for conducting effective analysis, aligning intention and vision, developing wise plans of action, and working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives in an environment of continuous learning and improvement. 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System is a powerful tool for organizations, communities, and individuals who are working towards a shared Vision and Values. It provides a framework for delivering projects and initiatives in a highly collaborative and adaptable way, while aligning local progress with global goals and objectives. By adopting the Lionsberg IDS, organizations and communities can work together in an informed, wise, and effective way towards their shared goals and objectives, and can continuously improve the way that they work together over time.

Technically, this approach is critical to producing [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] contained in the [[Meta Goal]]. 

The Lionsberg IDS is one system in the [[LIONSBERG System]] of systems, which must be co-operated in its entirety to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].
