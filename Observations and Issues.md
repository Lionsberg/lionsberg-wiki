# Observations and Issues

The Lionsberg System allows [[Members]] to submit Observations and Issues via the Observations Tool on the Lionsberg Instance of the Procore platform. 

The Observations tool helps track, assign, and report on multiple types of observations and corrective actions on the fly. Once observations are created, they can be properly assigned and collaborated on. 

The Project Manager of each group will be trained on the Lionsberg Procore System.
