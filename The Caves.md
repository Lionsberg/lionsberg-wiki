# The Caves

In the [[Myth Of Lionsberg]], **The Caves** are the starting point of the [[Quest]].  

For generations, nearly all humanity has been separated, divided, and held captive unaware in a massive labyrinth of caves. 

To escape, they must hear [[The Whispers]], wake up, and join [[The Great Movement]] out of The Caves, beyond [[The Boundary]], and through the [[The Waters And Deserts Of Chaos]] towards the [[New]].
