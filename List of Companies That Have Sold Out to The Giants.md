# List of Companies That Have Sold Out to The Giants
 
Lots of companies and brands start out with beautiful intentions. Many end up selling out to [[The Giants]] or [[Private Equity]] and seeing their life's work slowly torn apart. 

Here are a handful of companies that started well, and sold out. What if instead all these were part of a federation that We The People had a membership / stake in, and nurtured for future generations? 

It is far more difficult to create than to destroy.
