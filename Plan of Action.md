# Plan of Action

A Plan of Action is a detailed and comprehensive strategy and plan for achieving specific goals and objectives. It outlines the [[Milestones]] and [[Action Steps]] that must be taken, the resources that will be required, and the timeline for completion. A Plan of Action is essential for bringing a [[Vision Into Reality]] and for ensuring that the work is completed on time, within budget, and to the desired [[Quality]] standards.

In the context of the [[Lionsberg System]], and in particular the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]], a Plan of Action is the roadmap for achieving the shared Vision and Goals of the System. It is developed through the [[Lionsberg Planning System]], which involves reviewing the [[Vision and Purpose]],  conducting [[Analysis]], developing a [[Work Breakdown Structure]], defining [[Milestones]], and identifying the [[Action Steps]] required to achieve each Milestone.

A well-designed Plan of Action provides a clear and actionable strategy for moving each team and each element of [[Work Breakdown Structure]] forward towards [[The Goal]]. It helps individuals, teams, and the Team of Teams to prioritize and focus their efforts, to understand their roles and responsibilities, and to work together effectively towards a common Goal. Additionally, tracking and measuring the progress of each Action Step towards each Milestone helps to ensure that the work is on track and that the desired outcomes are being achieved.

## Developing a Plan of Action

1.  Define the shared Vision and Goals of the Lionsberg System, and align your personal Vision and Goals with the shared Vision and Goals.
    
2.  Conduct a thorough Analysis of your current situation, resources, constraints, and opportunities.
    
3.  Develop a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that breaks down the work into smaller, more manageable components.
    
4.  Identify the Milestones that lie between the current Reality and the future Vision, and prioritize them based on their relative importance.
    
5.  Define the Action Steps required to achieve each Milestone, and understand their resourcing and dependencies.
    
6.  Assign durations and resource requirements to each Action Step.
    
7.  Do a forward run through the entire plan to make sure it makes sense.
    
8.  Track and measure the progress of each Action Step towards each Milestone to ensure that the work is on track and that the desired outcomes are being achieved.
    

By following these steps and utilizing the tools and templates provided in the Lionsberg System, individuals and teams can develop a comprehensive and effective Plan of Action that will help them to achieve their personal and collective Goals.
