# II.C. Integrating Teams into a Team of Teams

Just as individuals form or join teams to achieve outcomes they cannot accomplish alone, teams must integrate themselves into a larger network of teams, known as a [[Team of Teams]], in order to achieve greater coordinated impact. Integrating teams into a Team of Teams provides several benefits, including:

1.  Improved alignment and coordination: Integrating teams into a Team of Teams helps to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and objectives, and that everyone's efforts are aligned with one another. This can help to prevent duplication of effort, and can ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction.
    
2.  Increased efficiency and effectiveness: By integrating teams into a Team of Teams, individuals, organizations, and communities can benefit from shared resources, knowledge, and expertise. This can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of each team's efforts, and can help to ensure that everyone is working at their highest level of skill and capacity.
    
3.  Enhanced resilience and scalability: Integrating teams into a Team of Teams helps to distribute the weight of the work and risk across a broad array of teams and domains, reducing the impact of single points of failure, and improving resilience and scalability.
    
4.  Improved ability to manage complexity: Integrating teams into a Team of Teams helps to manage the complexity of large, distributed systems, by breaking the work down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can help to ensure that everyone is able to focus on the work that they are best suited to do, and that the work is being done in the most efficient and effective way possible.
    
5.  Access to shared resources and support: By integrating teams into a Team of Teams, individuals, organizations, and communities can gain access to shared resources and support from the broader Lionsberg System. This can help to ensure that everyone has the resources and support they need to succeed, and can help to ensure that everyone is working together in the most efficient and effective way possible.
    

To integrate teams into a Team of Teams, it is important to have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the larger network, align the work of each team with the work of the broader ecosystem, establish clear lines of communication, and foster collaboration and trust among all team members. The Lionsberg System provides guidelines and best practices for integrating teams into a Team of Teams and ensuring everyone is working together effectively towards shared goals and values.
