# Meditation 48

Before you release [[The Arrow]], remember the ways you have missed the mark in the past. Try not to keep missing [[The Aim]] in the same ways. Try to not continue to repeat the [[Patterns of Failure]] you have already identified. If you are going to miss [[The Aim]], ensure that you miss it in a new way, that reveals to you more of what is not Wise, Right, and True. In this Way, you will soon find the narrow Pattern that allows [[The Arrow]] to progress every closer to the Absolute Center of [[The Aim]].
