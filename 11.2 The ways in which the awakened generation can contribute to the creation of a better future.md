2.  Act locally, think globally: The awakened generation can take action at the local level, while also thinking about the global impact of their actions. They can work to address the issues in their communities, while also thinking about how their actions can contribute to a larger solution.
    
3.  Get involved in policy-making: The awakened generation can engage in policy-making at the local, state, national, and international levels, to help shape the policies and regulations that will have a significant impact on the Meta Crisis.
    
4.  Foster collaboration and partnerships: The awakened generation can foster collaboration and partnerships across sectors and disciplines, working with governments, NGOs, businesses, and other organizations to co-create solutions to the Meta Crisis.
    
5.  Use technology and media: The awakened generation can leverage technology and media to raise awareness about the Meta Crisis, and to mobilize others to take action.
    
6.  Invest in education and research: The awakened generation can invest in education and research, to deepen their understanding of the Meta Crisis, and to develop new solutions and innovations.
    
7.  Embrace entrepreneurship: The awakened generation can embrace entrepreneurship, starting new businesses and initiatives that promote sustainability, regenerativity, and well-being.
    
8.  Be a part of the United Front: The awakened generation can be a part of the united front, a coalition of like-minded individuals and organizations that are co-operating the Lionsberg System and working towards a common goal of addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future.
    
9.  Volunteer for and support organizations like Lionsberg that are working on the Meta Crisis, or any other crisis or social issue that aligns with their values.
