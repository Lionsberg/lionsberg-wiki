# Collaboration

Given the [[Shift In Mindset]] from “silo” to “system,” lean requires collaboration between all the parties involved with a [[Program of Action]].  **_There is only one program, one intention, one vision, one system, and one goal_**. 

This includes the owner, receiver, program manager, IPD Teams, trade partners, operational personnel, and **_the global community that will inherit and operate the System_**. 

For a team of teams to truly succeed and thrive in Integrated Delivery, collaboration must go far beyond intellectual assent to “collaborate”, and into the actual behaviors and [[Verbs]] that constitute "collaborating."

[[The Goal]] is to forge living entities that are akin to a single organism, collaborating at the deepest cellular / DNA level for the wellbeing of the greater [[Whole]]. This is the essence of true [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. **_True functional unity of the highest order System is very closely related to [[The Goal]].

Collaboration includes transparently and freely sharing [[Information]] (including real-time issues and concerns) with others and learning from the talents, experiences and performance of others. Real collaboration cannot happen without [[Trust]] amongst the team members.
