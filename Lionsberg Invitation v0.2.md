# Lionsberg Invitation v0.2

Subject: An Invitation to Help Shape the Future 

Dear (insert name), 

Like us, we know that you are deeply cognizant and concerned about the unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities that this critical point in history presents.

You may also be joining us in the realization that in isolation we all lack the true transformational resources, relationships, and power required to transform the root causes of the issues we are facing, and forge the better future we all desire. 

Lionsberg is emerging as an independent and voluntary international federation, purpose-built to connect, serve, and empower citizens of goodwill across the globe. Our movement seeks to unite these conscious and engaged individuals in order to confront and overcome the challenges of our time, and forge the brighter future we all desire. 

Years of strategic planning and careful infrastructure development recently led to the formation of a **Pioneer Cohort**. Twenty individuals have bravely embarked on a transformative **12-week program** via the Lionsberg Orientation and Training System, and are now advancing together. This program serves to illuminate the narratives, paradigms, and patterns that are fueling societal dysfunction, while empowering participants to reassess their own stories and patterns, and come together to build a new, unified movement focused on resolving the challenges and capturing the opportunities that lie ahead.

The movement is designed to grow organically, on an **invitation-only basis**, with each cohort meticulously selecting and **inviting the subsequent wave** of members. This helps ensure we have the right individuals onboard, at the right time, for the right reasons.

We are thrilled to announce that the **Second Wave Cohort** is set to embark on June 25th. With a capacity for **between 12 and 20 individuals**, this new wave will bring our dedicated movement to a total of 30 to 40 passionate members.

The **Third Wave Cohort** will follow suit three weeks later, around July 16th, and is projected to expand the Lionsberg community to between 50 and 80 members.

By the close of Q3, we aim to surpass a membership of 100, a significant milestone that will open a realm of new possibilities for the Lionsberg Movement.

We believe that you possess unique qualities that make you a valuable candidate for co-creating the Second Wave Cohort, and in shaping the invitations for the Third and Fourth Waves. We warmly invite you to join us on this groundbreaking journey. The commitment involves working through daily transformative materials on an individual basis, complemented by facilitated group dialogues, governance discussions, and collaborative projects.

After successfully completing the 12-week Orientation and Training program, we extend an invitation for you to become a lifelong member of Lionsberg, joining us in the sustained effort to navigate the local and global challenges that will define this decade, and to ignite the torch of change for future generations.

Please respond to this invitation via the [Lionsberg Second Wave Response Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccZdKzafpcOSgtC2fCUzQI3WhhTdibTJYDaRPBd-zGpUFDHw/viewform?usp=sf_link) no later than Wednesday June 21st. If you feel that this opportunity is not for you at this time, we will be able to extend the invitation to another potential member.

Feel free to review the [[Lionsberg Participation Agreement (v0.2)]] to further understand the expectations and responsibilities of membership in Lionsberg. 

With Deep Love and Respect, 

(your name)
