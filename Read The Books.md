# Read The Books

"Read The Books" is an essential call to action for [[Citizens]] committed to deepening their grasp of the core ideas, principles, and tactics that underpin the [[New Vision and Plan]]. By delving into the foundational literature, individuals will not only acquire invaluable insights and expertise to effectively engage in the collective mission to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], halt [[The Advance of The Giants]] and forge the [[New World]], but also foster their personal growth and comprehension of our interconnected world.

The curated reading list encompasses an array of books and resources, each addressing various dimensions of the [[Meta Crisis]] and shedding light on the groundbreaking solutions and strategies necessary for constructing a more just, regenerative, and flourishing future for All. These materials lay the groundwork for those eager to make a meaningful impact within [[The Movement]] and [[The Battle]], inspiring transformative change on individual and collective levels.

As [[Citizens]] immerse themselves in the foundational literature, they will become better equipped to unravel the intricacies of the [[Meta Crisis]], effectively collaborate with others in [[The Movement]] and [[The Game]], and actively participate in the co-creation of the [[New World]], enriched by a profound understanding of the challenges and possibilities that lie ahead.

It also creates an accessible starting point to interacting with the depth of the [[Lionsberg Wiki]].
