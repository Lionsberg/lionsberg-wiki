# Fractal Sovereignty

As Individuals [[Organize and Federate]] to accomplish things together that they cannot accomplish in isolation, [[Sovereignty]], [[Autonomy]], and [[Authority]] are retained _at each [[Fractal]] level._  

In other words, a [[Group]] of 7 Sovereign and Autonomous Individuals is _itself_ Sovereign and Autonomous. 

Likewise, a Community of hundreds or thousands of voluntarily Co-Operating [[Individuals]] and [[Groups]] is also itself Sovereign and Autonomous. 

_At no point in the System does the flow of Sovereignty or Authority reverse._  

Sovereignty and Autonomy exist in the System within the Boundaries of the [[Rights and Responsibilities]] arising from the interexistence and interdependence of all Systems.
