**Leadership in the Context of Lionsberg**

In the journey from the Old World to the New, leadership becomes a collective endeavor. It moves away from the old models of hierarchical, power-centric leadership towards a model of shared, distributed leadership that values and harnesses the unique contributions of each individual.

In the New World, leadership fosters a culture of empowerment, collaboration, and shared responsibility. It promotes a sense of shared ownership and commitment towards the collective vision, encouraging each individual to step into their unique leadership roles.

Leadership, thus, becomes not just about leading others, but about leading oneself, stepping up to contribute in the co-creation of the New World. It calls each of us to lead with our unique strengths, insights, and contributions, fostering a society where every individual is a leader in their own right.
