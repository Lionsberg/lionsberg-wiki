# Domain Of Responsibility And Authority

Domains of Responsibility and Authority begin with the Self, Sovereignty, and Autonomy of each [[Individual And Local]], and are forged from the bottom up through [[Voluntary Consent]].  

No individual, organization, and institution can possess any [[Authority]], except that which is voluntarily delegated and entrusted to them by [[ONE]] and [[All]].  

No one may exercise [[Authority]] in any Domain without the [[Voluntary Consent]] of those in the domain.
