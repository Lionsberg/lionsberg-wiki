# Prologue to The Story and The Great Game

There comes a moment  
in the life of every world  
when what has long been tolerated  
can no longer be sustained  
  
Not because evil suddenly appears  
but because a deeper Reality is unveiled  
and Truth can no longer be postponed
  
That moment has now arrived on Earth  
  
For thousands of years, humanity has been shaped
by systems that rewarded extraction over care,
control over wisdom,
and obedience over understanding
  
Some of this was unconscious  
Some of it was inherited  
Much of it was deliberate and designed  
  
But all of it has now reached its limit
  
The old stories are breaking down  
The old systems are collapsing under their own weight   
The old authorities no longer command or deserve trust  
The old solutions no longer solve the problems they create  
  
What remains is a choice  
For every individual and locality on Earth  
  
Not between ideologies  
Not between nations  
Not between political parties  
Not between religions   
Not between leaders  

Not between any of the false dichotomies or dialectics  
designed to keep humanity divided, conquered, and enslaved  
  
But between continuing an omnicidal way of life that cannot endure
and remembering how to live wisely, lovingly, justly, and differently—
Together as **ONE Body**   
  
This is not the first species or world to face such a threshold and test   
However what is at stake is of epic and archetypical importance    

We are living through the convergence of crises—
an ecological, social, technological, and spiritual meta crisis—
that cannot be solved in isolation.
  
They are not separate failures.
They are not independent crises. 
They are symptoms of a single forgetting.
  
A forgetting of who we are.  
A forgetting of how life and civilization works.  
A forgetting of where we came from, where we are going, and why.  
A forgetting of what it means to belong to one another  
and to the precious communities and worlds that sustain us.  
  
And yet—
Something else is happening.  
Something powerful, new, and good is rising.  
  
Across cultures, continents, and generations,
people are awakening to the same quiet realization:
  
The future will not be saved by leaders and institutions destroying it.
It will be shaped by the good people in each small circle of trust   
willing to take responsibility for how they live, relate, and act—now.
  
This is where the story changes.
  
Not through force.  
Not through conquest.  
Not through external salvation.  
Not through escape.  
  
But through enlightened, conscious **co-creation**.
  
Through small groups of good people
choosing to seek wisdom, 
tell the truth,
restore trust,
heal wounds,  
move mountains, 
and take tangible action together  
to co-create **Heaven Right Here On Earth**. 
  
Through a return to first principles:
truth,  
love,  
justice,  
stewardship,  
care,  
reciprocity,  
responsibility,  
regeneration,  
and shared meaning, purpose, faith, and hope.
  
What lies beyond this threshold is not a doctrine.  
It is not a belief system or ideology.  
It is not a promise of safety, certainty, or salvation.  
  
It is an invitation consciously co-create **Heaven On Earth**. 
  
An invitation to step into **a living story**  
To participate in **a real-world game**  
whose purpose is not dominating or defeating others  
but remembering how to design and build communities and worlds  
that lift **all their inhabitants** up towards flourishing and abundant life  
  
You do not need to agree with everything you read
You do not need to understand it all at once
  
You only need to notice whether something deep within you  
recognizes and resonates in Spirit, essence, and intent  
  
If it does,  
you are invited to read on  
and step into **The Story of LIONSBERG**  
and **The Great Game** that follows  
  
If it does not,  
simply continue your own path in peace  
knowing you are respected, loved, and invited  
  
**The Gate** remains open
  
**The Bridge** across **The Chasm** awaits
  
What matters now
is whether enough of us
choose the bridge over the collapse—
and cross together as ONE Body.

For all who resonate  
Step onward into **[[The Story of x]]**  
And then begin **The Great Game**
