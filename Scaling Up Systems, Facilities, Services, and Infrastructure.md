# Scaling Up Systems, Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure

The [[Receiver]] planned to empower the [[Co-Creation]] all basic [[Systems, Facilities, Services, And Infrastructure (SFSI)]]  that were lacking on a scalable and replicable basis. 

The proliferation of [[SFSI]] would follow a tipping point strategy starting with local centers of gravity where there was a sufficient population of skilled professionals capable of building out locally suitable and adapted [[SFSI]], and then expanding out through training and development into more distant areas.
