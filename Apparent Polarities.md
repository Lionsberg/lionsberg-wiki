# Apparent Polarities

Apparently Polarities must be [[Consciously Mediated]], integrated, balanced, and cohered so that one's existence is [[Properly Ordered]] and [[Wise]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]] we refer to this as [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]].  

This is ultimately a process of [[Transcendence]] of [[Physical]], [[Mental]] and [[SpatioTemporal]] limitations and illusions that moves us Deeper towards a Primary Identification with the [[One]] [[Ultimate Reality]] that creates, sustains, destroys, encompasses, orders, and coheres [[All]] things within ItSelf. 

- [[One]] and [[All]]  
- [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]]  
- [[Yin]] and [[Yang]]  
- [[Boundaries]] and [[Boundlessness]]  
- [[SpatioTemporal]] and [[OmniSpatioTemporal]]  
- [[Centralization]] and [[Decentralization]]  
- [[Left Hemisphere]] and [[Right Hemisphere]]  
- [[Indigenous]] and [[Non-Indigenous]], [[The Eagle and The Condor]]  
- [[Ancient]] and [[Modern]]  
- [[The East]] and [[The West]], [[The North]] and [[The South]]  
- [[The Drive Towards Survival and Self-Preservation]] and [[The Drive Towards Exploration and Expansion]]

Notes: 

- The [[Walls of Self-Preservation]] we build today become [[Walls of Self-Imprisonment]] tomorrow.  
- [[The Drive to Build and Remain Within The Boundary]] and [[The Drive to Expand Beyond The Boundary]]
