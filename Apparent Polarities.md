# Apparent Polarities

Apparently Polarities must be [[Consciously Mediated]], integrated, balanced, and cohered so that one's existence is [[Properly Ordered]] and [[Wise]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]] we refer to this as [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]].  

This is ultimately a process of [[Transcendence]] of [[Physical]], [[Mental]] and [[SpatioTemporal]] limitations and illusions that moves us Deeper towards a Primary Identification with the [[One]] [[Ultimate Reality]] that creates, sustains, destroys, encompasses, orders, and coheres [[All]] things within ItSelf. 

- The [[Masculine]] and the [[Feminine]]  
- [[Yin]] and [[Yang]]  
- [[The Drive Towards Survival and Self-Preservation]]  
and [[The Drive Towards Exploration and Expansion]]  
	- The Walls of Self-Preservation we build today become Walls of Self-Imprisonment tomorrow.  
	- [[The Drive to Build and Remain Within The Boundary]] and [[The Drive to Expand Beyond The Boundary]] 
- [[Boundaries]] and [[Boundlessness]]  
- [[Centralization]] and [[Decentralization]]  
- [[Left Hemisphere]] and [[Right Hemisphere]]
