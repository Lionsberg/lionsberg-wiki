# Apparent Polarities

Apparently Polarities must be [[Consciously Mediated]], integrated, balanced, and cohered so that one's local and universal existence is [[Properly Ordered]] and [[Wise]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]] we refer to this as [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]].  

This is ultimately a process of [[Progressive Transcendence]] of [[Physical]], [[Mental]] and [[SpatioTemporal]] limitations and illusions that moves us Deeper towards a Primary Identification with the [[One]] [[Ultimate Reality]] that creates, sustains, destroys, encompasses, orders, and coheres [[All]] things (associative and dissociative energy) within ItSelf. 

As a side note, or perhaps centrally, the flower of the Universe unfurls itself along the vortices created by the synergetic [[Reciprocal Opening]] that can *only* occur through the dance / play / harmony of the apparently polar forces that compliment and complete one another and bring forth Life. 

The [[Central Animating Spirit]] of the Universe is that which rises [[Above The Chaos]] and Wisely and Consciously mediates between the apparent polarities to bring forth The Future That Is Most Good.

Notes: 

When we [[Fear]] and retreat into one side of an Apparent Polarity, we fall off The Line / The Tip of the Needle and end up reaping that which we fear. 

- Too much decentralization reaps chaos reaps totalitarian control / order 
- Too much centralization / control reaps totalitarian order reaps chaos 
- The [[Walls of Self-Preservation]] we build today become [[Walls of Self-Imprisonment]] tomorrow.
