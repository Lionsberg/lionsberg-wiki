# IV.C. How aligning intention and vision relates to the Lionsberg System

Aligning intention and vision is an essential component of the Lionsberg System, as it helps to ensure that everyone is working together effectively towards our shared goals and objectives. The Lionsberg System is designed to integrate the efforts of individuals, teams, organizations, and communities towards a shared vision of the best possible future we could achieve together, and to help everyone work together effectively towards that vision *across generations.*

In the Lionsberg System, aligning intention and vision starts at the individual level, as each person must have a clear understanding of their own goals, values, and priorities. Each individual must consciously choose, align, and communicate their [[Aim]]. This understanding is then used to inform the goals and objectives of the teams their forge or join, which in turn must align with the goals and objectives of the broader ecosystem across the short, medium, and long term. 

It is important to note that aligning intention and vision is not a one-time effort, but rather an ongoing process that requires continuous improvement and adaptation at all fractal levels. Individuals and teams must regularly review and evaluate their goals and objectives, and must ensure that they are aligned with the goals and objectives of the broader ecosystem. This requires open and transparent communication, and a willingness to work together across the lines that divided us in the past towards the shared goals and objectives that bring our [[Vision]] into [[Reality]]. 

The Lionsberg System provides guidelines and best practices for aligning intention and vision, and for ensuring that everyone is working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives in each team, organization, and community they participate in. By aligning intention and vision throughout the System, everyone in the Lionsberg System can work together effectively towards shared goals and objectives, and can ensure that their work is contributing to the success of the broader ecosystem and its multi-generational Vision.
