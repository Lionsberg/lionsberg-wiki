# The MP - Denial, Anger and Fear

At first, the citizens of earth were in deep denial about how serious the situation had become. 

As they began to be awakened from their slumber by more and more [[Evidence]], they grew angry. In their anger, they began to shout and agitate for change within the existing systems. They complained. They protested. However the more they shouted, and the more light they shined into the existing systems, the more it became clear how corrupted, co-opted, and incapable the existing systems had become. 

It was not merely that the existing systems and leaders were incapable of meeting the crisis; they were fundamentally unable to as a consequence of years of corrupting influence that distorted and diminished their ability to act in a coordinated and competent way for the long term good of the people and their planet.
