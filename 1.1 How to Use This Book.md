# 1.1 How to Use This Book

As we embark together on this epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]], each week you will reach new junctures that will require you to make important and transformational choices. 

Our individual and collective ability to **avoid failure and succeed** on [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] will rest largely on the quality of the [[Conscious Decisions]] we make—individually, and collectively. 

Because [[The Means Are The Ends]], the [[New World]] we [[All]] inherit will be the product of what we [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] along the [[Way]]. So however we would like our life and our world to be, today is the day to begin partnering with [[ONE]] and [[One Another]] to embody it. We are all here for that shared mission. 

This book is meant to serve as a helpful Guide for our shared journey. It anticipates some of the [[Obstacles]], [[Challenges]] and [[Goals]] that lie ahead. 

As you read it and [[Progress]] on [[The Quest]], please help improve it for [[All]] those will follow in your footsteps. [[Every Defect Is A Gift]]. Everything about [[LIONSBERG]] is a [[Work In Progress]], and is built to transform and get [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

If you find something missing, co-create it. 

If you can improve something, transform it. 

If you see something that doesn't belong, remove it. 

If you see something that should be done, that is not being done, that you are willing and able do, it is likely yours to do! 

We are All Co-Creators of The New.
