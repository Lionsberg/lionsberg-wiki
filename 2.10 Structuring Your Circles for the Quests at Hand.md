# 2.10 Structuring Your Circles for the Quests at Hand

Every [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Circle and Group should choose a Wise Right structure to protect and facilitate its emergence.

Below are some simple guidelines and recommendations. 

#### Tier 0 

When the Golden Seed of LIONSBERG emerges into any given Domain and sovereign individuals and groups decide to nurture it, it sprouts up as part of a broad cosmic network, co-operating in Divine partnership with the Creator and all aligned Creation. As such its various manifestations are by definition superordinate to any local laws, and universally protected on spiritual and religious grounds by the sovereign right and responsibility of All created beings to associate and coordinate their efforts to co-create Heaven.  

Associating to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] in community does not require any permission, any approval, or any legal standing or structure. It is the sovereign right and responsibility of all beings, flowing from the Divine spark within. It is entirely up to every Sovereign Individual, Circle, and Group how and whether they desire to structure their activities, and how and whether they want to comply with existing local authorities and regulations. 

In many jurisdictions, organizing and allocating resources in partnership with the Creator and One Another in service of [[The Goal]] is an a priori right and responsibility that is a tax exempt activity, regardless of government recognition of legal status. Every individual, circle, and locality should consult their own conscience and seek appropriately qualified guidance. 

The page [[Provisional Structure]] has additional guidance. 

#### Tier 1 Private Voluntary Association

By default, we recommend that every Circle and Group begin their journey as a [[Private Voluntary Association]] of Individuals. In many jurisdictions, it is wise to organize on spiritual / religious grounds as a "church" or ecclesiastical association for the sake of clearly identifying the voluntary association as both private and protected on religious grounds. 

#### Tier 2 Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Association

Teams / Groups that will be more persistent may want to strengthen their structure into a more formally documented [[Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Membership Association]] or locally articulated equivalent. This type of association is protected as an inalienable right of individuals to associate and pool resources and commitments for valid shared spiritual and pragmatic aims.  

#### Tier 3 Fiscal Sponsorship and Donor Advised Funds

Teams / Groups engaged in activity that requires aggregating and channeling philanthropic resources may benefit from leveraging an existing legally recognized non-profit for [[Fiscal Sponsorship]], [[Donor Advised Funds]], or other such mechanisms. These should be treated as "utilities", and the directory of suppliers continuously improved for the benefit of all groups. 

#### Tier 4 Legal Stewardship Structures 

Teams / Groups engaged in commercial activity will often choose to establish a [[Legal Stewardship Structure]] to protect them and their value-creating activities. 

For an example of such a structure see the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]]. Although the first instance was abandoned following [[J's Death]], it is a template born of hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal research that can be replicated in any domain as needed. 

Circles / Groups remain eternally Sovereign, Autonomous, and Free, and may choose any structure they wish, and evolve that structure as appropriate over time, recognizing that only structures that honor the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]] may receive the benefits of being part of The Lionsberg Federation. 

Popular examples of legal structures in the united states (for cross reference to other domains) include:  

1. Ecclesiastical organizations  
2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)  
3. Worker-Owned Co-Operatives  
4. Limited Liability Companies stewarded by perpetual purpose trusts, non-profit organizations, churches, or similar legal vehicles that no one owns.  

In all cases, we recommend structures based on transparent shared stewardship and dynamic infinite games over narrow minded Old structures that establish "percentages of ownership and control".

#### Tier 5 Federated Stewardship Structures 

The strong, strong recommendation of the LIONSBERG System is to [[Federate Everything]] as will be discussed in subsequent sections.
