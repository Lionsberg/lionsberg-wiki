# Every Defect Is A Gift

In an environment of Continuous Learning and Improvement, the standard of success is not [[Perfection]], but [[Continuous Improvement]].

If the [[Way]] the System works is to continuously surface efforts and improve itself, then [[Every Defect Is A Gift]] because it creates the opportunity for the [[Whole]] to learn and improve. 

This concept goes hand in hand with [[Zero Blame Environment]].
