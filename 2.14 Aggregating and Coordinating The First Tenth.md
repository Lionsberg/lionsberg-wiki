# 2.14 Aggregating and Coordinating The First Tenth

Our Aim is not to build a thousand independent Circles to compete with one another, but to build millions of autonomous Circles and Communities that co-operate with One Another as ONE Body towards ONE Future and ONE Goal. All things helping All things rise. 

Co-operating as ONE Body requires aggregating and coordinating some percentage of our time, energy, and resources at the highest level we can arrange. 

Over thousands of years across many worlds, it has been demonstrated that is usually wise, right, and good to coordinate at least [[The First Tenth]] of our available Flow of Time, Energy, Attention and Resources for the Good of All. Very, very few mature systems keep the coordination level that low, often rising towards 15% or 30%+. 

As we unite and empower [[The First Three Percent]] of the population, this initial resource pool will ensure that every Individual, Circle, Group, and Locality has access to world class tools, resources, technologies, services, and support far beyond what any could afford to access in isolation. 

If 1,000 Circles pool [[The First Tenth]] and make Wise Right collective governance decisions on what to do with those [[Ecosystemic Resource Flows]], every individual Circle will have access to tools and technologies orders of magnitude beyond what they could individually afford. 

Crucially, this ensures that the most disadvantaged and vulnerable Circles, Groups, and Localities have equal access to a Commons that rapidly lifts them up towards equal strength and footing with all other groups. 

If the Old billionaires pool the first tenth for themselves while excluding our friends in the slums desperately searching for a dollar a day, that does not a fair or Divine Symphony make.
