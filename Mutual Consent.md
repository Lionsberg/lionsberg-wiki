# Mutual Consent

The term "Mutual Consent" in the context of the Lionsberg System refers to a principle of voluntary association and cooperation between Participants in a team, organization, group, or community.

Under this principle, all association between Participants and the group they wish to join is voluntary and based on mutual agreement. Participants must assent to the [[Rules of Participation]] of the group they wish to join, and the group must be willing to accept the Participant as a member.

This principle of Mutual Consent is critical to ensuring that Participants are working together in a safe, respectful, and productive manner, and that everyone is aligned with the shared Vision, Goals, and Values of the group and the Lionsberg System as a Whole.

By operating under the principle of Mutual Consent, Participants are able to work together effectively and efficiently towards shared goals and objectives, while preserving their autonomy and independence as individuals, teams, organizations, or communities.
