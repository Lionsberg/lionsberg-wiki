# Template For Analysis

The purpose of this template is to guide individuals and teams through the [[Analysis]] process as part of the [[Lionsberg System of Work]]. By following this template, individuals and teams will be able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current situation and the forces, conditions, resources, constraints, and opportunities that impact their work. This information, in conjunction with the [[Vision and Purpose]], will inform the development of the [[Plan of Action]], the [[Work Breakdown Structure]], the identification of [[Milestones]], and the definition of [[Action Steps]] required to achieve each Milestone.

## Step 1: Define the purpose of the Analysis

-   Clearly state the purpose of the Analysis, including the specific goals and objectives that you hope to achieve.

## Step 2: Gather Data and Information

-   Gather data and information from a variety of sources, including:
    -   Internal sources, such as previous reports and studies, data from previous projects, and feedback from stakeholders.
    -   External sources, such as industry reports, competitor analysis, and market research.
-   Ensure that all data and information is accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.

## Step 3: Conduct Stakeholder Engagement

-   Engage with stakeholders to gather additional information and to gain a better understanding of their perspectives, needs, and concerns.
-   Consider conducting surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to gather information from a wider range of stakeholders.

## Step 4: Review the Current Situation

-   Review the current situation, forces, conditions, resources, constraints, and opportunities that impact your work.
-   Consider the following questions:
    -   What are the key drivers and trends that are shaping your current reality?
    -   What are the current constraints and challenges that are impacting your current reality?
    -   What are the current resources and opportunities that you can leverage to achieve your goals?
    -   What are the current [[Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and Trends (SWOTT)]] that impact your current reality?

## Step 5: Identify Key Issues and Risks

-   Identify any key issues and risks that may impact the success of your work.
-   Consider the following questions:
    -   What are the potential roadblocks or obstacles that may impact your work?
    -   What are the potential risks that may impact your work?
    -   What are the potential consequences of these risks and issues?

## Step 6: Develop Contingency Plans

-   Develop contingency plans to address any key issues and risks identified in step 5.
-   Consider the following questions:
    -   How can you mitigate or eliminate the impact of key issues and risks?
    -   What are the backup plans or alternative options if the key issues and risks cannot be mitigated or eliminated?

## Step 7: Review and Refine the Analysis

-   Review the Analysis to ensure that it is accurate, relevant, and comprehensive.
-   Refine the Analysis as needed based on the information gathered, feedback from stakeholders, and any changes to the situation or context.

## Step 8: Use the Analysis and Vision to Inform the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Plan of Action

-   Use the information gathered during the Analysis process and compare it to the [[Vision and Purpose]] to inform the development of the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] and [[Plan of Action]]. 
-   Consider the following questions:
    -  What is the total [[Scope of Work]] required to transform FROM your current reality, TO your Vision and Purpose?   
    -  What are the key Features of Work that must be included in the WBS?

## Conclusion

By following this template, individuals and teams will have a comprehensive understanding of the current situation and the forces, conditions, resources, constraints, and opportunities that impact their work.
