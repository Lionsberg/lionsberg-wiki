# Dopamine

At a fundamental level, [[Dopamine]] can be thought of as the physiological driver or currency of motivation and forward progress.

Dopamine is released by neurons and functions as a neurotransmitter, sending signals to other nerve cells.

Dopamine is modulated to signal the **perceived** level of pain or pleasure, desirability or aversiveness, associated with a **future** objective or outcome.

This modulation then drives the organism either towards or away from the goal or outcome.

The levels of dopamine in the brain predominantly increase _**in anticipation**_ of pleasure or reward.

This is why being in pursuit of a Worthy Aim is crucial to success and wellbeing.
