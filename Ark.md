# Ark

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], the "Ark" is a metaphorical concept that represents a vessel built to carry the collective wisdom, principles, values, and culture of humanity as we navigate the turbulent waters on our [[Quest]] towards the [[New World]]. 

Inspired by the biblical story of Noah's Ark, this symbolic vessel embodies the preservation and transmission of culture, knowledge and ideals across generations and serves as a guiding and protective beacon on our journey to create a better future.

The Ark symbolizes the need for unity, cooperation, and protection as we navigate towards the [[New World]], as well as the importance of safeguarding our shared heritage, culture, and values for the benefit of all. 

By uniting and working together in harmony, we can build [[LIONSBERG]] into an Ark that can successfully weather the storm and carry us safely towards the [[Land Of Promise]].
