# 0.3 The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG

You now hold in your hands  
A tiny gleaming **Golden Seed**  

It is shockingly heavy  
As if the **Metaphysics**  
Of the Universe  
Lie enfolded within  

It vibrates and hums  
Crackling with Potential  
And bursting with Light and Life  

It radiant Warmth  
Stands in stark contrast  
To the cold void  
And steel chains  
You are about to leave behind  

What kind of **Potential Future**  
Is **This** you been gifted?  

What strange and magical  
**Creation** is now yours  
To nurture and fulfill?  

Where did it come from?  
Why has it come to you?  
Why Here?  
Why Now?  
What Then?
