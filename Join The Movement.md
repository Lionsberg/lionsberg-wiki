# Join The Movement

Joining the Lionsberg movement is an opportunity to become part of a global network of individuals, groups, and organizations committed to co-creating a regenerative, just, and flourishing world for [[All]]. Here are some ways to get involved:

1.  **Forge or Join a Group:** Join an existing Lionsberg group in your community or area of passion, or start your own starting with the [[Forge or Join a Group]] page. Connect with like-minded individuals and work together to tackle [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]] to confront and overcome the Meta Crisis and forge the Best Possible Future in your local area and areas of expertise.
    
2.  **Spread the Word:** Help spread awareness and [[Pass The Flame]] by sharing information about the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[Citizen Led Response]] with your friends and family. You can also use social media and other platforms to connect with like-minded individuals and spread the message.
    
3.  **Get Involved in Local Action:** Local action and community-building are key parts of the Citizen Led Response. Get involved with local leaders, groups and initiatives in your area that align with the Vision, Goals, and Values of The Movement. 
    
4.  **Support the Movement:** You can also support The Movement by making a financial contribution or volunteering your time and skills to support the development and growth of the platform and the movement. A donation form is available on the [Join The Movement Page](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement)
    

By joining the Lionsberg movement, you can play a vital role in co-creating a better future for all.
