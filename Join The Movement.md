# Join The Movement

Joining the Lionsberg movement is an opportunity to become part of a global network of individuals, groups, and organizations committed to co-creating a regenerative, just, and flourishing world for [[All]]. Here are some ways to get involved:

1.  **Join a Lionsberg Group:** You can join an existing Lionsberg group in your community or start your own using the [[Template for Group]]. Connect with like-minded individuals and work together to confront and overcome the Meta Crisis in your local area.
    
2.  **Participate in The Great Game of Lionsberg:** The Great Game of Lionsberg is a gamified substructure for [[The Movement]] hosted on the Lionsberg platform that encourages players to complete challenges and advance on their personal quest towards realizing the [[New Vision and Plan]]. By participating in the game, you can connect with others and contribute to the broader movement towards a more just and sustainable world.
    
3.  **Spread the Word:** Help spread awareness of the Lionsberg movement by sharing information about the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[Citizen Led Response]] with your friends and family. You can also use social media and other platforms to connect with like-minded individuals and spread the message.
    
4.  **Get Involved in Local Action:** Lionsberg encourages local action and community-building as a key part of the Citizen Led Response. Get involved with local groups and initiatives in your area that align with the values and goals of the Lionsberg movement and the [[New Vision and Plan]].
    
5.  **Support the Movement:** You can also support the Lionsberg movement by making a financial contribution to Lionsberg or volunteering your time and skills to support the development and growth of the platform and the movement.
