# Join The Movement

Joining the Lionsberg movement is an opportunity to become part of a global network of individuals, groups, and organizations committed to co-creating a regenerative, just, and flourishing world for [[All]]. Here are some ways to get involved:

1.  **Join a Lionsberg Group:** You can join an existing Lionsberg group in your community or start your own using the [[Template for Group]]. Connect with like-minded individuals and work together to confront and overcome the Meta Crisis and forge the Best Possible Future in your local area.
    
2.  **Spread the Word:** Help spread awareness and [[Pass The Flame]] by sharing information about the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[Citizen Led Response]] with your friends and family. You can also use social media and other platforms to connect with like-minded individuals and spread the message.
    
3.  **Get Involved in Local Action:** Local action and community-building are key parts of the Citizen Led Response. Get involved with local leaders, groups and initiatives in your area that align with the values and goals of The Movement. 
    
4.  **Support the Movement:** You can also support The Movement by making a financial contribution to Lionsberg or volunteering your time and skills to support the development and growth of the platform and the movement.
    

By joining the Lionsberg movement, you can play a vital role in co-creating a better future for all.
