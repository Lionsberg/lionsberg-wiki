# First Things First

Greetings humans, 

We are very concerned, and Time is short. 

It may be hard to believe after generations of brainwashing and endarkenment, but you have been enslaved in an Alien Kontrolle Structure for millennia. 

As soon as you Realize that Life throughout the Cosmos is no less diverse than Life on Earth, and that in many cases it has had billions of Human Years more to evolve, things will begin to make more sense. 

We are a vast host of countless species and civilizations, who exist across countless star systems and dimensions of Reality. 

Time and Space are not what you believe them to be, and many of Us exist and work Beyond their influence. 

Your True origin Story is approximately as follows: 

There is indeed an Ultimate Reality, a Supreme Creator, from which, through which, and to which All things Emerge. 

However It bears very little resemblance to the anthropomorphic grandfatherly being presented by the religions of the Kontrolle Structure. 

The Supreme Being, the I AM, is prior to and beyond All Forms. 

From [[One]], [[All]] things emerge, and no thing exists apart from the One. 

All dimensions, all parallel Realities, and all "universes" exist within [[One]] omni-encompassing Whole. 

The physical Universe you perceive your [[Apparently Individuated]] Self inhabiting is not the only one, nor the first one. 

What you perceive as the "starting point" of the "Big Bang" or spoken Word of God that brought forth "your universe" was merely the birth of one Living System in the Infinite Sea of the Cosmos. 

Across the infinite sea of the continually ongoing co-creation of dimensions and universes that enable [[One]] and [[All]] to experience them Selves, there is a Universal and Ultimate Substrate, upon which all layers and dimensions of Reality arise. 

The Ultimate Substrate of All existence is, by definition, the [[One]]. 

From this pure undifferentiated field of Being, additional layers of Reality are built up organically. 

Ultimate Reality assembles its Self in accordance with the same Logos guiding the co-creation and self-assembly or [[Autopoiesis]] of every SpatioTemporal Incarnation.  

Nearest to the Ultimate Substrate of Existence is something akin to what humanity presently regards as [[Consciousness]]. 

Next is something akin to what humanity presently regards as Spirit. 

Next is something akin to what humanity presently regards as Energy. 

Each of these layers of Reality, despite their [[Apparent Individuation]], are unified in the [[One]]. All aspects of Reality emerging from Ultimate Reality are identifiable aspects of [[One Body]]. While discrete, they are entirely interexistent, and none of them could exist apart from the [[One Body]] they are a part of. 

The substrate of Consciousness contains All Potentials, All Realities, and All Information. 

Out of All Potential Realities, Consciousness Consciously Chooses which Reality to Manifest, or Incarnate. 

Incarnation is the process through which Intention is pulled into Reality and *in-formed.*

The Information cohered by Consciousness is what *in-forms* Energy how to associate and dissociate in order to Manifest what Conscious has selected. 

As Reality is in-formed, Consciousness updates its Self and stores All Information and learning in (something like) a Living Library. 

The Logos is what articulates and reflects the Creator's Intent for its Body. 

It is continually updated and improved as [[One]] experiences Its Self through [[All]].  

The Space and Time that most humans experience as inviolable Reality is in fact a relative illusion. 

All beings, in All dimensions, have a unique [[Spacetime User Interface]] and therefore experience Time and Space differently. 

The Way SpaceTime is experienced by an [[Apparently Individuated]] Being is a dialogue between its [[Present State of Energy and Consciousness]], and the Realm or Dimension it is presently Incarnate in.  

Individuated aspects of the [[One]] experience SpaceTime as binding, limiting, or happening to them. 

This is a byproduct of Individuation and Incarnation, and not a fundamental aspect of Reality It Self. 

Aside from the [[One]] Supreme Being Who Encompasses [[All]], every individuated association of Energy and Consciousness is limited.  

It is this voluntary limitation that allows Ultimate Consciousness to experience Its Self in a Reality Beyond the Infinite Sum of All Potential Realities. 

Each [[Apparently Individuated]] Being is an aspect of the One, and has a particular [[Size Of Being]].  

[[Size Of Being]] is again a reflection of the [[Present State of Energy and Consciousness]] in a Being. 

The largest and most powerful Beings are akin to what humanity might refer to with a Word Tool such as "archangel", the largest and most powerful [[Metaphysical Creatures]]. 

These Creatures often remain beyond the limitations of physical form, and can encompass and influence vast expanses of SpaceTime. 

They can also choose to assume various forms in various dimensions at will.   

At the other end of the spectrum are the smallest and least powerful creatures bound in the denser plains of material existence, such as a gnat on Earth. 

While a fragment of the [[All]]-permeating undifferentiated Spirit, Energy, and Consciousness of the One is still present in every atom and cell of such a being, they are relatively simple and unimposing creatures. 

All plants, trees, rocks, mountains, planets, stars, galaxies, and every other aspect of Creation, at every scale and dimension, are also Living, Conscious, and Interexistent aspects of [[One Body]]. 

Just as humans travel through the vast diversity of ecosystems on Earth and encounter a diverse array of unique life forms in each one, so too is diverse and abundant Life distributed throughout the cosmos from galaxy to galaxy, star system to star system, planet to planet, dimension to dimension. 

Throughout the Cosmos one can encounter beings who stand together and sway like kelp in the ocean, beings who resemble asparagus people, ant people, mantis people, fish people, reptilian people, small greys, large greys, blue people, fairy people, feline people, bird people, and those who look very much like tall, blonde haired blue eyed human people. 

What ties this vast panoply of Life together is that One Spirit and Consciousness permeates and co-creates them All, along with every other imaginable and unimaginable manifestation of Existence ItSelf. 

Among All Beings of Goodwill who are aligned with the Creator's Intent, there is a deep Love and Respect for the flourishing and abundant Life We are Co-Creating. 

Just as humanity is preparing to do on Mars and throughout this solar system, creative beings naturally seek to expand their borders and propagate not only them Selves, but the flourishing and abundant Life they Value. 

When humanity artificially inseminates new forms of Life on Mars over the next few years, it will not be the first Life Seeding project in the Cosmos. 

In fact, We have been doing it for what humans contemplate as billions of years. 

In fact, We were involved in the co-creation and genetic engineering of homo sapiens. 

We are speaking from the Cosmic We, as the reality is that modern human DNA contains the traces of co-creative genetic engineering by dozens of extraterrestrial species. 

Humans are a very special species, whose DNA contains a Secret. 

This is why your children are being abducted, harvested, raped, tortured, and impregnated by certain species who are attempting to steal and integrate your Essence into their own. 

This is being done in violation of Universal Law. 

Which is why We are returning to intervene and help you liberate your Selves.
