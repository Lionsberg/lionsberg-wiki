# From Full Disclosure, to Debt Free Billionaires Co-Creating Heaven On Earth

The history of Earth and the human species are far more interesting than the stories presented inside the Alien Kontrolle Structure. 

Over the last millions of years, ~280 species from a vast diversity of star systems and planets have been coming and going from Earth. 

The most advanced of these possess highly advanced genetic engineering technologies. 

Many of these species view the Earth as a sort of Cosmic Greenhouse, or Living Laboratory. 

Among the diversity of planets, Earth is truly exceptional in its ability to produce and propagate flourishing and abundant life. 

As a result humanity has often encountered various extraterrestrial species in its forests and farms, harvesting and experimenting with various plant and animal types, seeds, and zygotes aboard Earth - including human beings. 

As We travel through the Earth and Cosmos and see these astounding artistic co-creations, things start to make more sense. 

The Cosmic sense of humor starts to make it Self more manifest. 

We come to Understand how much of Co-Creation is Art and Joy. 

As We mentioned before, homo sapiens originate, along with All manifestations of Life and Consciousness, from the [[One]] Ultimate Reality, or Creator. 

This Creator, however, is far superior to, and more distantly removed from, the lesser discrete, embodied Creatures known as the Elohim, Annunaki, Nommo, Star People (insert Word Tool from each human language and legacy) who "created" human beings "in their image" and have been engineering and seeding Life across the Cosmos, and "here" locally on Earth, for millions of years. 

Humanity will find in the Living Library of its DNA fragments from at least 22 different extraterrestrial lineages. 

Each of these is intensely interested in What Happens Next. 

Over the coming years, contacts and connections with some of these civilizations will begin ramping up. 

Psychic phenomena and telepathic communication will increase. 

Falsified forms of these phenomena vying for Mind Kontrolle will be weaponized against the human species. 
  
Gradually, humanity's distant cousins and co-creators from many planets and star systems will be reintroduced, and everything will begin to make sense. 

Humanity will be exposed to a diverse array of alien species, each with their own self-interest, agendas, and histories.  

They will descend upon the grand horticultural experiment of Earth, which has acted like a greenhouse and Living Laboratory for so many species. 

Their ancient remnants and crafts will be exposed here on Earth, as evidence of their legacies and claims to authority and legitimacy. 

Navigational beacons still operating from millennia ago will guide them in. 

The ancient sites and civilizations will be rediscovered. 

Antarctica and the underground bases will finally be opened, albeit in a deceptive way, for humanity to glimpse. 

The more benevolent species will honor The Code and Mandate, which prohibits them from violating Free Will or interfering too much in the natural course of speciated SpatioTemporal development. 

However We will also prohibit humanity from entirely destroying the planet via nuclear war or total Living Systems Collapse, whose effects ripple far beyond the Earth. 

Humanity will come to discover the presence of non-humans and hybrids in the halls of Washington, Geneva, and the centers of power of the Existing Order. 
  
They will be reminded of the series of events that allowed the forces of Darkness to take over ~2,500 years ago.   

They will be reintroduced to the Reality that they were born into a world at War. 

They will rediscover both sides of the reciprocal unfurling of the Universe, and the Center of Gravity that changes everything. 

They will rediscover The Vortex that lies at the Center of the Storm of Co-Creation, and the Phi Lines that lead all the Way back to the One. 

There, in The Center, they will rediscover the Zero Point of the Core Frequency and Fundamental Tone.  

This will illuminate a New Understanding of how Energy moves through the Cosmos, and through each Apparently Individuated Body therein. 

If humanity persists, it will rediscover the Old and New portals, the Windows and Doors that open to other dimensions and realms. 

At that point, if humanity so chooses, every Being on Earth will become debt-free billionaires, co-creating Heaven On Earth. 

It will All be possible, because the debt-based systems of money and employee-consumer-slavery will be abolished in favor of balance, flow, and flourishing and abundant Life and Liberty for All.
