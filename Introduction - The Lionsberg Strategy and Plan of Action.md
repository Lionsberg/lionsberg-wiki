Old 2

The Meta Crisis, which is the culmination of multiple global crises including environmental degradation, poverty and economic inequality, social injustice and discrimination, and unjust governance, threatens the very existence of life on Earth. The New Vision and Plan, presented in the book [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]] offers a comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.

However, simply having a vision and plan is not enough. We must also have a concrete strategy and plan of action through which the New Vision and Plan can be implemented. This book, "The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action," will provide just that. It will outline a step-by-step plan for the voluntary adoption of the Lionsberg System, the new operating system for humanity, in the 7-year window between 2023 and 2030.

This book is intended for a global audience of individuals, organizations, and governments who are committed to creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It will provide a detailed and actionable plan for the successful implementation of the New Vision and Plan and the Lionsberg System, as well as the tools and resources necessary to make it happen.

The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action is not just a book, it's a call to action. It's a call for individuals, organizations, and governments to come together and work collaboratively to implement the Lionsberg System and bring about a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The time for talk is over, it's time for action. Let's co-create the future we all desire.

The Lionsberg Strategy includes a comprehensive plan of action for the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach in accordance with the New Vision and Plan, which aims to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The strategy is designed to be implemented within the 7-year window of opportunity from 2023 through 2030, and focuses on the gradual and voluntary rise of consciousness and collaboration towards higher order functional unity.

Some key steps and milestones of the strategy include:


The Lionsberg Strategy is designed as a collaborative citizen led effort that involves the participation of individuals, communities, organizations, and governments from all sectors of society. The importance of citizen led engagement and participation cannot be overstated in the implementation of the strategy. If citizens do not awaken, arise, and take lead in unison in accordance with the New Vision and Plan, the strategy will fail because it is inherently unable to violate the free will of citizens or be implemented from the top down by existing structures of leadership and governance. The strategy is intended to perpetually remain a living work that must be continuously updated and refined as new information, insights, and technologies become available to this and subsequent generations. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of clear and effective communication, so that all stakeholders are informed and aware of the progress and changes being made. It also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability, to ensure that all stakeholders are held responsible for their actions and contributions towards the implementation of the strategy. This will be accomplished through a combination of dashboards and quantitative monitoring, as well as deep listening and analysis of qualitative and experiential stories and narrative descriptions from stakeholders around the world. 

Furthermore, the strategy also acknowledges that the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach will require significant financial and human resources, and as such, it includes a detailed plan for funding and resource allocation. This includes the development of innovative funding mechanisms and partnerships with the private sector, plans and structures for a series of citizen led public private joint ventures, as well as the creation of a robust and sustainable funding and endowment structure to support the ongoing implementation of the Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan across subsequent generations. 

In summary, the Lionsberg Strategy is a comprehensive and holistic plan of action for the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach as a means to accomplish the New Vision and Plan, that aims to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It focuses on the gradual rise of all things towards highest order functional unity and it is designed to be implemented within the 7-year window of opportunity between 2023 and 2030. The strategy emphasizes the importance of citizen led engagement and participation, collaboration and partnerships, and transparency and accountability. It also includes a detailed plan for funding and resource allocation, and it is intended to be a living work that is continuously updated and refined.
