# Introduction - The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action

The Meta Crisis, which is the culmination of multiple global crises including environmental degradation, poverty and economic inequality, social injustice and discrimination, and unjust governance, threatens the very existence of life on Earth. The New Vision and Plan, presented in the book [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]] offers a comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.

However, simply having a vision and plan is not enough. We must also have a concrete strategy and plan of action through which the New Vision and Plan can be implemented. This book, "The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action," will provide just that. It will outline a step-by-step plan for the voluntary adoption of the Lionsberg System, the new operating system for humanity, in the 7-year window between 2023 and 2030.

This book is intended for a global audience of individuals, organizations, and governments who are committed to creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It will provide a detailed and actionable plan for the successful implementation of the New Vision and Plan and the Lionsberg System, as well as the tools and resources necessary to make it happen.

The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action is not just a book, it's a call to action. It's a call for individuals, organizations, and governments to come together and work collaboratively to implement the Lionsberg System and bring about a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The time for talk is over, it's time for action. Let's co-create the future we all desire.
