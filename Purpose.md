# Purpose

The term "Purpose" in the context of the Lionsberg System refers to the reason for which an individual, team, organization, or community exists and the goals and objectives it seeks to achieve.

It answers the fundamental first question: [[Why]]? 

The value of purpose represents a sense of meaning and direction in life, and can be achieved through aligning one's actions and goals with their values, passions, and reason for being. It involves finding a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in one's work and relationships, and can be supported through opportunities for personal and professional development.

Purpose is the driving force behind the work of [[Participants|Participants]] in the [[LIONSBERG System]], and it is what unites and motivates everyone to work together towards shared [[Vision]] and Goals.
