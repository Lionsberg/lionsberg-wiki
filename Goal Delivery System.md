# Goal Delivery System

Every project or initiative of reasonable complexity orders and contains within itself a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. Goal Delivery Systems are designed to integrate, order, and prioritize those goals within the context of a single overarching and uniting [[System]] purpose-built to produce throughput of shared goals and values. 

A Goal Delivery System is a powerful tool for organizations, communities, and individuals who are working towards a shared Vision and Goal. It is also designed to be highly adaptable, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities at local, regional, and global scale.

In the context of [[Lionsberg]], the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] provides a framework for integrating and delivering projects and initiatives in a highly collaborative and adaptable way, while aligning local progress towards global goals and objectives. By adopting a Goal Delivery System, organizations and communities can work together in an informed, wise, and effective way towards their shared goals and objectives, and can continuously improve the way that they work together over time.
