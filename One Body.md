# One Body

In the context of Lionsberg, One Body is a metaphor associated with [[The Idea]] of the [[One]] that permeates, sustains, and orders [[All Creation]] within ItSelf. 

It is also an invitation for humanity to consciously arise and unite as One, taking up its rightful and proper place among the powers and functions of the broader [[Cosmic Order]] it interexists within.
