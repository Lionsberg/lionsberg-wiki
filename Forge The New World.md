# Forge The New World

The concept of "Forge the New World" is central to the Lionsberg System and refers to the collective effort to create a regenerative, just, and flourishing future for all. This effort involves confronting and overcoming the interconnected array of crises and challenges facing humanity and the planet, collectively called the [[Meta Crisis]], and co-creating the conditions for life and society to flourish in harmony.

Forging the New World requires a fundamental shift in the way we think, speak, live and interact with each other and the planet. It involves a transformation of our values, priorities, and systems to prioritize the long-term well-being of people and the planet over the short-term accumulation of profit and power. This shift requires a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of the Meta Crisis and emphasizes collaboration, innovation, and resilience.

Individuals can contribute to forging the New World by joining the [[The Movement]] and the [[Citizen Led Response]] through the [[LIONSBERG System]] and taking action within their communities and [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]]. This involves forming or joining groups and working together towards common goals. 

Forging the New World is not a task that can be achieved overnight, but rather a long-term multi-generational process that requires sustained effort and dedication. It is a collective effort that requires the participation of people from all walks of life and all corners of the world.
