# A Day Worth Thinking, November 22

Every day is [[A Day Worth Thinking]]. 

What if, every day, we dedicated time to thinking on the the [[Deepest]] and most important things? 

How might our minds be elevated and transformed if they were forced to swim daily in the Deepest and Most Profound oceans they could access?
