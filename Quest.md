# Quest
A quest is a [[Journey]] toward a specific [[Mission]] or a [[Goal]]. In folklore, this word is often used to describe a difficult or epic [[Journey]] towards a great prize, which is often infused with sacred, symbolic or allegorical meaning. Tales of [[Quests]] figure prominently in the folklore of every tribe, nation and tradition.  

In the [[Lionsberg System]], we use Quests as a basic Way to help us establish and clarify our [[Narrative Framework]].  

Overarching, uniting, and cohering All things in the System is the universal [[Meta Quest]] towards the [[Meta Goal]].
