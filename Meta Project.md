# Meta Project

The [[Universal and Eternal]] program of action to accomplish our highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[LIONSBERG System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

The **Meta Project** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "project of projects", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible projects.

The idea of the [[Meta Project]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align the [[Individual And Local]] projects we participate in with the universal [[Meta Project]] that unites us [[All]].  

All of our activity, whether we acknowledge it or not, is part of the total program of human activity. The question is how consciously and competently we are participating in it, individually and collectively. 

Specifically, the Meta Project could be conceptualized as the total program of action required to: 

1. Solve the [[Grand Challenges]] 
2. Accomplish the [[Global Goals]] 
3. Forge the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]] 

In other words, the [[Kingdom of God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]].
