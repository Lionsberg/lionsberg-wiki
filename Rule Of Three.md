# Rule Of Three

In the context of the Lionsberg System, the **Rule of Three** is a heuristic for [[Organizing And Federating]]. 

It holds that as a general rule, Work should be accomplished in small groups, and that the minimum group size is three. 

To honor this Pattern, individuals should [[Forge or Join a Group]] based on the consent of two other individuals around a Proposal.
