# The MP - Retaining the Best of the Old, While Gaining the New

The Lionsberg System was constructed to facilitate a phase shift in the Way humans existed and organized themselves upon the earth. Evolutionary rather than revolutionary, it invited humanity to voluntary rise into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] in a parallel [[Citizen Led]] New System, without renouncing the existing (and useful) citizenships, memberships, and sovereignties forged at such great expense during the previous millennium. 

This voluntary System allowed each individual and locality to retain the very best of their existing features and benefits, while also gaining powerful new capabilities and solutions beyond what they could access or achieve in isolation. 

This New System and Approach afforded humanity the ability to act in a far more intelligent and competent manner, across a far greater range of situations, while ensuring the ongoing sovereignty, autonomy, and local self-determination of each individual and group.
