# Lionsberg Principles and Values

The Lionsberg System is founded on a set of core values and principles that are designed to guide behavior, decision making, and action within the community. These values and principles are intended to be universal, self-evident, and derived from the Spirit or Essence of Absolute and Unconditional Love, which is the Spirit of God as we understand it.
