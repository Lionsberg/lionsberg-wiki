# 6.3 The need for a new vision and plan

The Meta Crisis requires a comprehensive and integrated response that addresses the interconnectedness of the various dimensions of the crisis and prioritizes long-term sustainability, wellbeing and regenerative capacity for all. Current approaches have been ineffective in addressing the root causes of the crisis and mitigating its consequences due to several limitations. These limitations include a lack of holistic and integrated perspective, short-term thinking, and a dominant paradigm that prioritizes economic growth, individual success, and political power over collective well-being and the flourishing of the planet.

A New Vision and Plan is needed to effectively address the Meta Crisis. This New Vision and Plan must take a holistic and integrated perspective that addresses the interconnectedness of the root causes of the crisis. It must prioritize long-term regenerative flourishing and align with a new paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet across all generations of life. It must be comprehensive and cohesive, bringing together a vast array of actors and sectors to work towards a shared Vision and Goal, and it must be inclusive and just for all, ensuring that the needs and perspectives of all members of society are taken into account.

This New Vision and Plan must be more than just a collection of individual solutions, **it must be a new operating system for humanity.**  A new way of thinking, planning, acting and navigating towards our shared goals and values that is capable of addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and creating a better future for all humanity and all life on Earth. It must be a new paradigm that is able to navigate and harness the complexity, uncertainty, and volatility of the current era, and to co-create a regenerative and flourishing future for all. 

The current approaches have not only been ineffective in addressing the Meta Crisis, they have created it. A New Vision and Plan that takes a holistic and integrated perspective, prioritizes long-term regenerative flourishing, and aligns with a new paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet is needed to effectively address the Meta Crisis and co-create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.
