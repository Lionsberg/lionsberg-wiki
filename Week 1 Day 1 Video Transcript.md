# Week 1 Day 1 Video Transcript

(0:00-0:30) [Introduction] 

"Hello, pioneers! I am deeply grateful that you have accepted this invitation, and am honored to officially welcome you to Lionsberg, a place of discovery, learning, and transformation. We are embarking on the road less traveled, the path of refusing to accept the default trajectory of our lives and our world, and choosing instead conscious exploration, growth, and co-creation of our shared future. And it all begins with our first orientation experience: understanding the basics of how our consciousness and Lionsberg itself are arranged according to a narrative structure."

"We live our lives within the emerging threads of countless stories. The narratives we tell ourselves about who we are, where we are, how we got here, where we are heading, and why, weave the fabric of our individual realities. In a grander scale, societal and cultural narratives shape our collective understanding of the world, the cosmos, and our purpose within them."

(1:31-2:30) "Our consciousness fundamentally operates on a narrative framework, a series of interconnected stories that give meaning to our lives and experiences. These stories, and the values and goals they impel us towards, are prior to even perception, determining which tiny subset of Reality, out of the entire universe of potential, actually presences itself to us." 

This means that it is only by first aligning our overarching and uniting stories, goals, and values, that we can begin to perceive the same reality, orient our selves, and navigate together through it towards our destiny. 

Recognizing this, Lionsberg is being co-created as an immersive, transformational journey within this narrative structure. It's not a tactic or a quick fix; it's an acknowledgment of the fundamental way we perceive and understand the world around us, and a commitment to using this understanding to foster growth, learning, and mutual development."

(2:31-3:30) "As you embark on this journey, you'll encounter new ideas and concepts, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and participate in activities designed to inspire introspection and collective growth. This transformative journey is more than gaining new knowledge; it's about reshaping your personal narrative, learning to navigate the world with a new perspective, and being equipped with the practical skills to take action and succeed on our shared quest."

(3:31-4:30) "You won't be just an observer on this journey, you'll be an active participant. Together, we will weave a shared story of growth and learning, a living narrative that evolves with our collective wisdom, experiences, and understanding. And we will do this while getting into action together to design and build the better future we all aspire to. Remember, you are an integral part of this story. Your insights, your experiences, and your perspective will help shape our shared narrative and destiny."

"After great prayer and discernment, we have chosen to wrap this 12 week orientation journey in a story already familiar to billions of people around the world - the story of Exodus. The word Exodus literally means "the Way out" or "the Way upward." It a story of liberation from existence in a corrupt and exploitative environment of spiritual, economic, and social enslavement, through the challenges and trials of wilderness, towards a land of promise, plenty, and right relationship with between the Creator, humanity, and all creation. It is the most well known human story of a Quest from a failing Old World to a flourishing New World. As such, regardless of your background or system of beliefs, this meaningful and inspiring story presents a perfect narrative container to hold the space of our collective journey out into the unknown, and towards a better future." 

(4:31-5:30) "You might ask, 'When can we get to work?' Remember, you're free to move, explore, experiment, and learn. Follow your passions, form groups, and start making progress. Nothing is holding you back. You don't need permission. Here, we are all sovereign, autonomous co-creators of Lionsberg and our shared reality, and everything must be self-organizing and emergent from the bottom-up, not the top-down. If you are ever feeling impelled towards action, make a proposal, forge or join a group in accordance with the Lionsberg Pattern Language, and get moving. We will cover this in more detail in the upcoming training and orientation sessions." 

"For today, there are some activities below that encourage you to reflect on one or two pivotal moments in your own story, and ponder how those have shaped your journey since, and how they inform your deepest purpose and motivation for being here on this journey."

(5:31-6:30) [Conclusion] "Before we sign off, please review and sign the Lionsberg Participation Agreement if you haven't already. This agreement establishes the basic boundaries and rules of the game, and is essential for all participants. Now, let's start this journey together. 

Remember, every Sunday is a time for reconnection, spiritual practice, and for crafting the vision, strategy, and plans for the week ahead. Make it meaningful, deep, beautiful, loving, and good."

(6:31-7:00) "Welcome to Lionsberg. I look forward to embarking on this transformative journey with you, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow Lord-wiling for Day 2."
