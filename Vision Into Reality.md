# Vision Into Reality

Bringing a Vision into Reality refers to the process of turning an abstract concept or idea into a tangible and achievable outcome. It involves taking a [[Vision]] and creating a comprehensive and actionable [[Plan of Action]] that outlines the steps, resources, and timeline required to make the Vision a reality.

In the context of the [[Lionsberg System]], and in particular the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]], bringing a Vision into Reality refers to the process of taking the shared Vision and Goals of the System, and turning them into a tangible and achievable reality through the development of a comprehensive [[System]] and [[Plan of Action]]. This process involves conducting [[Analysis]], developing a [[Work Breakdown Structure]], defining [[Milestones]], and identifying the [[Action Steps]] required to achieve each Milestone.

Bringing a Vision into Reality requires a deep understanding of the context and circumstances surrounding the Vision, as well as the resources and capabilities available to bring the Vision to life. It also requires a commitment to continuous improvement, and a willingness to adjust the Plan as necessary based on changing circumstances and new information.

Through the process and discipline of bringing Vision into Reality, individuals, teams, and the Team of Teams can work together effectively towards a common Goal, and create a tangible and lasting impact that aligns with the shared Vision and Goals of the Lionsberg System.
