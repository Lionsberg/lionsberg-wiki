# Level Of Commitment

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that [[Lionsberg]] should instantiate a [[Lionsberg Currency]].  

This currency will be co-created internally within the community by [[Sovereign]] individuals voluntarily agreeing to self-organize and collaborate towards the [[Lionsberg Goals]]. 

The voluntary effort towards shared goals will be measured based on a [[Level Of Commitment]] that ranges from 1 to 7. 

## Why We Are Not Basing Currency On Time
- We have experienced that accounting for time on task is a major failure mode. 
	- In Jordan's builder world, this can be thought of as 
		- Time and Materials Pricing  
		- Unit Pricing 
		- Lump Sum Pricing  
- A far better measure is Value Delivered / Goals Accomplished. 
- At the same time, there is deep deep intangible value that comes from working together, building relationships, and being together in shared spaces as you do Valuable things.  
- As you do Valuable things together, issues or opportunities will presence themselves, wisdom and life experience can be shared, issues and emotions can be processed. 
- So the deep commitment to investing [[Time]] together and staying deeply [[Presence|Present]] to what emerges is critical.  
- Yet we don't want to track [[Time]] at all, because it many senses the illusion of it imprisons us. 

## Why We Are Not Basing Currency On Value 
- Value is more important to measure than time, but is complicated for a variety of reasons
	- Can be perceived as scarce
	- Can be invisible 
	- Requires surfacing and broadcasting everything one does, as opposed to doing the wise right thing at the right time for the right reasons, especially when no one sees. 
- [[Value]] is critically important, especially as it is defined in the [[Lionsberg System]] relative to [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]], and differentiated from [[Waste]].  
- So it needs to be carefully measured and acknowledged... without imprisoning us. 


## Potential Currency Game
- A group commits that they are going to do stuff together
- Something like - once a week people say to the group something like 
    - Here is what I did that I think was of value... 
    - and here is approximately what I think the value is... 
    - And the group - validates it... 
    - and Michael's experience is that usually the group values the contributions more highly than the individual does... so it works... 
- Pete 
    - This may be a step or two up from basic... 
    - still doesn't feel right... 
- Let's keep working on this... 
- Another way to do it... 
    - is via some form of commitment based UBI [[Energy and Commitment Based UBI]]. 
    - that maybe tracks a few different levels of commitment
	    - quarter time / half time / full time levels... 
- I find value in tracking Value creation... 
- and also in (something like) unrestricted operating grants for talented people to do what they believe they should do next to accomplish the goal... and having Faith that value is getting created... 
- And tracking value creation - is a rough back check... 
- Usually community has to advocate for the value they see in others... 
- Often people will try to hide the value they created... 
    - Often we don't want our work to get weighed and measured... 
- So homework for community is to be really thoughtful and vigilant about - 
    - so and so doesn't do anything 
    - another person say - no she is the glue that holds us together... 
- In a good society, it just works, everyone gets fed, and even the people who you arent' sure, no one can advocate for them, there is at least some value created by being a part of the group... 
- In UBI - you have to make sure htat we are accomplish GOALS AND HIGHER PURPOSES... 
- Vigilance - are we continuing to make progress - even through progress isn't tied to the way we share resources... 
- A few approximate time/commitment ranges
    - 1/10th
    - 1/4th
    - 1/2
    - 3/4
    - Full consciousness 
        - this is really a multiple of full time because it becomes how you are, what you think about when you're asleep, in the shower, etc... 
        - paves the way for Epiphanies bursting in upon you that can cut massive shortcuts... 
        - that are more possible the more you attend to something...  (not necessarily the outcome of full time)
- Something like 
    - We are all here in service of one overarching and uniting goal - meta goal
    - Each of us is spending some portion of our time... 
- Value Bands
    - As a young organization - maybe intern band and 3 or 4 steps... 
    - it is a negotiation between the indivdiual, the community, and the community's GOALS... 
    - review every couple months... 
    - When the individual and community make a co-commitment to one another
    - Here is the level of commitment to the project
    - and here is the level of values I think I can create relative to the goals of the community... 
    - Lionsberg has particular goals it is working towards
    - Is something is contributing a lot but not ADVANCING THE OBJECTIVES... it is essentially an advisor bonus
    - co-commitment... 
    - Here is the level of commitment I am going to make... 
    - and in good faith I think everyone will be please in two months... 
    - and come to one of the 7 levels... 
    - fewer levels in the beginning, more for mature organization
    - Review - do you think you are contributing on the quarter commitment level 
    - How do you feel about it? 
    - How does the community feel about it... 
    - Just doing it honestly - did you really think you earned that... 
    - you will end up in a situation where there is some disagreement... 
    - it is a qualitative and human negotiation... 
    - and normal humans - when sharing the feast - normal humans make sure everyone fed, getting right amount... 
- If it is a straight 1 to 7 level of value creation, agreed in community, that implicitly recognizes both time / value / commitment all in one... 
- even value created is the wrong metrics... 
- It is commitment level - not value... 
- and there are two kinds of goals - heart and soul goal... and our imperfect understanding / hypotheses of how we get there... hypotheses of heart and sould goal
- what we want to advance towards is higher purpose and goal... 
- even lame ill grandma - lying there on couch, getting fed and nursed.. .
    - the act of feeding and nursing grandma helps people advance their heart and soul in a way that is intangible and not in the way of creating better IT system or making sure thirsty people got water... 
    - we are feeding homeless people who aren't contributing - of course they are - they are contributing by being fed and letting us help them
    - a dn teh investment we make in them is returned many fold in ways we can't even know... 
- When you are ready and the community is ready - an agreement is made... 
- and we use wisdom and discernment and judgmenet to do the right thing at the right time for the right reasons to accomplish the highest objective. 
- Community can award bonuses or special recognition, honor, etc... for things contributed, work done prior... 
- at christmas or thanksgiving
    - shoot - X got more than they deserve, but its ok its christmas time
    - shoot - x got less - let's share and set that right... 
- net net thing is commitment towards higher purpose and the only way to judge that is in community... 

## Jordan's Summary to Incorporate... 
- The [[Lionsberg Time Currency]] was a concept that was a stepping stone.
- Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that the [[Lionsberg Currency]] should begin with a simple [[Level Of Commitment]] on a scale from 1 to 7, made as an agreement between the individual and the Community. 
- If this scales out to all humanity, our entire society would operate on a 1 to 7 level of income equality, that could allow for resources and standards of living to adjusted as appropriate across all various contexts as we grapple with the currency systems of the [[Old World]]. 


## Get Stuff Done
- Via self-organizing and federating small teams, in agreement on [[Level Of Commitment]], who routinely submit and incorporate the [[Value]] they create into [[Lionsberg]].
