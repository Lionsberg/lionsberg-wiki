# The Code Of Integrated Delivery

To implement the [[Five Big Ideas of Integrated Delivery]], the [[Program of Action]] needs not only a [[Provisional Structure|Structure]], but also a [[Behavioral Code]] / [[Culture]] that makes Integrated Delivery possible. 

Integrated Delivery requires specific behaviors and cultural norms in order to succeed.  These behaviors support a change in mindset **FROM** individual contracts and [[Self Optimization]] **TO** a collective endeavor and global optimization.  

[[Collaboration]], [[Trust]], [[Commitment Based Management]] and [[Continuous Improvement]] are all behaviors required of each individual andGroup in an [[Integrated Delivery Environment]].  

Yet we know that laws and contracts are merely the faintest restraints on our worst impulses. It is hard to enforce behavior with laws and contracts. #principle 

When required “behaviors” are seen as the tools used to drive [[Value]] to the endeavor and drive waste and frustration out, they become more pragmatic strategies than social engineering. People need to see the pragmatic value in choosing one set of behaviors over another.

**_These behaviors are valuable because they lead to the collaboration and communication that is necessary to make any complex project successful_**.

Lean Integrated Delivery cultivates the development of teamwork, and a balancing of risks and burdens across the entire [[Integrated Delivery System]]. 

Right collaborative relationships coupled with lean integrated thinking make rapid iteration and implementation possible. 

While the relational and cultural side promotes the building of [[Trust]], the lean process side promotes the building of [[Quality]] and [[Reliability]]. 

These two go together, as ongoing [[Reliability]] in the [[Network of Commitments]] made and kept is another cornerstone of building [[Trust]]. 

[[Trust]] as a human attitude arises in conditions of safety and reliability. 

[[Reliability]] comes from the way systems are designed, implemented, and operated, and from the ability of the people operating the systems to understand how their actions affect the [[Whole]]. 

Integrated Delivery requires people to focus on **_system performance_**, not just siloed performance.  

The [[Lionsberg]] [[Meta Project]] is focused on the total performance of the [[Human System]] and [[Living System]] at the highest possible level. 

[[Reliability]] is created by people making and keeping commitments to get work done within a properly designed system and structure; Lean Integrated Delivery views a project as a **_network of commitments_**, the fulfillment of each making the follow-on performance possible.

These commitments can be **statistically measured within a [[Percent Promises Kept]]** framework that drives [[Accountability]] throughout the System, with a particular focus on the [[Handoff Points]] between teams.

Finally, people and systems are not infallible.  Outcomes will not always match expectations.  Hence, the team must be structured to learn rapidly from [[Variance Between Expected And Actual Outcomes]]. 

Critical behaviors necessary for Integrated Delivery to be successful include:

-   [[Collaboration]]
-   [[Trust]]
-   [[Commitment Based Management]]
-   [[Continuous Improvement]]
