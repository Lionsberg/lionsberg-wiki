# Heroes On The Front Lines

In midst of the institutional failure, around the world everyday [[Heroes]] were working tirelessly on the front lines of every battle to make the world a better place. People of [[Goodwill]] were arising and gathering whatever resources they could leverage to solve the crises that were all around them.

Yet despite their best efforts over the early decades of the new millennium, [[Suffering]] and [[Injustice]] continued to abound. 

In isolation, we all lacked the true transformational power required to transform the [[Root Causes]] of suffering and injustice.

We realized amount that no amount of trying to do what we had done in the past better could ever get us to where we needed to go. A more radical transformation was needed and at hand.
