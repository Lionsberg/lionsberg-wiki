# Observers

The term "Observers" in the context of the Lionsberg System refers to individuals or organizations who are interested in following the progress and activities of Participants in the system, but who are not actively involved in contributing their skills, knowledge, or expertise to advancing the shared Vision, Goals, and Values.

Observers in the Lionsberg System may be interested in the progress and outcomes of the system, but may not have the capacity or resources to actively participate in the work. They may also be interested in learning about the Lionsberg System and its approach to collaboration, vision, analysis, planning, execution and continuous improvement in a multi-generational stewardship context.

Observers are an important part of the Lionsberg System, and are encouraged to follow along and learn from the work of Participants. They may also have the opportunity to participate in learning and development opportunities, or to contribute their resources and support to the system in other ways.

The Lionsberg System is designed to be highly transparent and open, and Observers play a critical role in helping to ensure that the work of Participants is accessible, understandable, and transparent to all stakeholders. Observers help to ensure that the system remains accountable and responsive to the needs and interests of all parties.

In the Lionsberg System, Observers are valued for their role in providing an external perspective, and for their potential to contribute to the system in the future, as resources or capacity permit. Observers are a key part of the system's ecosystem, and their participation helps to ensure that the Lionsberg System remains inclusive, diverse, and responsive to the needs and interests of all stakeholders.
