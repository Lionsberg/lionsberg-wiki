# Meditation 205

We co-create heaven or hell for our selves through the perpetual transformation of our consciousness, its transformation of our world, its transformation of our consciousness, its transformation of our world, its transformation of our consciousness... and infinitely so on. Neither our world or our consciousness can remain the same from one moment to the next. They are constantly transforming and being transformed. Spirit is the only Force capable of intervening in, mediating, and guiding the reciprocal opening of Consciousness and Reality.
