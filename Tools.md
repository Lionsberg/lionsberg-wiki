# Tools

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Tools]] and [[Anti-Tools]] are identified so that [[Practitioners]] can improve [[Value Creation]] and eliminate [[Waste]]. 

[[Tools]] are only used where they add [[Value]] to the [[Program]] by increasing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].  

[[Tools]] used improperly or merely for form usually create [[Waste]], not [[Value]]. 

[[Tools]] are used to enhance [[Wise Right]] decision making by ensuring [[Transparency]], [[Thoroughness]], and the consistency of a Continuously Improving [[Process]].  

Each Tool relates to one or more of the [[Attend, Plan, Act, Learn, Improve Cycle]].
