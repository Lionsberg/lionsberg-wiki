# 0.6 Stepping Forward and Never Looking Back

Suddenly your Mind is hit  
By the flashes of a thousand  
Visions and memories  

You gasp as you viscerally  
Feel what it means  
To stand on the edge between worlds  

Staring through **The Threshold**  
Across **The Chasm**  
And into **The Wilderness**  
And wonders that lie **Beyond**  

Behind you lie the ruins  
Of collapsing systems  
Shattered lies  
Broken promises  
And fading empires  

Within you stirs a memory  
A knowing  
Ancient Eternal and Unbroken  

> **_We were destined for so much more_**

The Sacred Gate  
Seems to burn  
With Spirit and Truth  
With Light and Life  
With Wisdom and Love  
With a Future and a Hope  

It is a Gate of **Story**  
Of **Choice**  
Of **Departure**  
Of **Becoming**  

It shimmers and dances  
And rises before you  
Radiating **Purpose** and **Adventure**  

It responds to your **Presence**  
It knows you are **Here**  
It knows you **Belong**  

It was made for you  
It has been waiting for you  

As it pulls you **Closer**  
You can feel its **Energy**  
And sense its **Power**  
Calling you **Home**  
Drawing your **Forward**  
Towards the **Destiny**  
You have **Always Known**  

Deep within  
You knew this moment would come  
Every sorrow and every joy  
Every loss and every triumph  
Ever step of your life and lifetimes  
Has been leading you here  

You are **Here Now**  
For a **Reason**  
For a **Purpose**  
For a **Potential**  
For a **Leap of Faith**  

_There is no going back_  
_There is no looking back_  

Just one step forward  
And you be swept into the **Great Living Work**  
Of becoming and co-creating  
Something entirely **New**  

A **New Being**  
Raised into **New Light**  
And **New Life**  

A **New Civilization**  

A **New Realm** 
Reharmonized with the Eternal  
**Wisdom** **Principles** and **Values**  
That cause **All Creatures** to flourish  
In Divine Harmony with **ONE** and **One Another**  

As your Spirit rises  
In jubilant celebration  
Your body feels as if  
It is floating through the air    
Towards **The Threshold**  
And **The Divine Hand of Guidance**  
Offered to you  

As soon as your fingers touch   
The radiant Hand of Guidance  
You know that Life  
Will never be the same  

What **Stories** and **Adventures**  
Lie **Beyond The Boundary**  
Are far beyond  
Your present ability to conceive  

Yet you **Trust**  
That each Gate will open in its **Time**  
That each Step will reveal what you **Need**  
That each Move will draw you  
Deeper into **The Great Work**  

At last  
The long-foretold moment has come  
The future of Earth  
And far Beyond  
Has been waiting for this moment  
_And for you_  

As the gravity of a thousand suns  
Pulls you across The Threshold  
The fiery golden light  
Of the Ancient Letters  
Fades from view  
And a pure White Luminescence  
Blankets your mind  
Like **New** fallen snow  

The cold darkness and steel   
You felt upon awakening  
Now feels like a distant nightmare  

A former Reality  
That was surely only a Dream  

Or was it?  

The sensation is so overpowering  
The questions so overwhelming  
The energy so overflowing  
Your systems cannot cope  
And your Mind collapses  
Back into The Dream  

>_"Welcome again Beloved_  
>_We have been waiting for you_  
>_Our epic Quest towards Destiny has begun_
