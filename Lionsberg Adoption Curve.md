# Lionsberg Adoption Curve

The Lionsberg Adoption Curve is rooted in our [[Current Best Understanding]] of how human beings progressively adopt new ideas and technologies. 

## Way To Adopt - Small Groups

Our Hypothesis is that adoption should be done in small groups, who can [[Help One Another]] learn, localize, and adapt the [[Lionsberg System]] in the [[Wise Right]] to their own unique [[Time]] and [[Space]].  

## Group Size - 3 to 20, Average ~ 7 

Positing a group size range of 3 to 20, and an average group size of 7, and 7.77 billion people adopting the system in 7 years, we have roughly a billion groups as a big target for humanity to [[Aim]] at. 

## Pattern of Adoption - Golden Ratio? 

If adoption pattern expands along roughly the Golden Ratio of 1.61803 expansion per reciprocal cycle, we would surpass 1 billion on the 44th cycle assuming zero loss rate. 

If we add is loss / attrition rates, the number of cycles changes as follows: 
- 0% Loss Rate - 44 Cycles
- 10% Loss Rate - 49 Cycles  
- 20% Loss Rate - 54 Cycles 
- 30% Loss Rate - 61 Cycles 
- 40% Loss Rate - 71 Cycles 
- 50% Loss Rate - 84 Cycles  
- 60% Loss Rate - 104 Cycles 
- 70% Loss Rate - 138 Cycles  
- 80% Loss Rate - 205 Cycles  
- 90% Loss Rate - 408 Cycles 
- 100% Loss Rate - The Movement Is Dead 

If the Movement dies, begin again with a new group of at least 3, and never give up, no matter how difficult, dangerous, or embarrassing it gets. 

## Time Function 

To the Pattern of Adoption, a time frame must be applied. 

The [[Aim]] is to hit 1 Billion Groups in 7 Years, or 2,555 days, starting in Q4 2022 and completed by Q4 2029. 

To bound the time function, that would require: 

- At 0% Loss Rate, a Cycle Time not exceeding 2,555 / 40 = 63.875 days 
- At 90% Loss Rate, a Cycle Time not exceeding 6.26 days 

## Hypothesis On Loss Rate

Based on our [[Current Best Understanding]], we have developed a hypothesis on the [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to experiment with,

- *If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of the 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg, we can hold [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to under 20%.* 

## Hypothesis On Expansion Rate

Based on our [[Current Best Understanding]], we have developed a [[Hypothesis]] on the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to experiment with: 

- _If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg, we can hold the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to under 42_

## Hypothesis On Success Rate

- _If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg..._ 
- _...we can hold the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to under 42 days_
- _...while holding the [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to under 20%._ 
- _This results in 54 or fewer cycles at a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of 42 or fewer days, leading to an anticipated Project duration of 54 x 42 = 2,268 or fewer days._ 
- _2,268 days / 365 = 6.2 years, leaving 0.8 years, or 9.6 months of float._ 
- _This will result in us being able to accomplish our [[Aim]] of connecting and empowering 1 billion [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] groups, encompassing 97% of humanity, around shared Goals and Values, within 7 years... 

These various ratios should be monitored.
