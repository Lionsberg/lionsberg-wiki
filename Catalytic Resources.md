# Catalytic Resources

Catalytic Resources are the essential knowledge, tools, funding, and support systems that can launch and accelerate the implementation and scaling of the [[New Vision and Plan]] for a more just, regenerative, and thriving world. These resources can play a pivotal role in empowering individuals, communities, and organizations to take action, overcome barriers, and unlock their full potential to contribute to the transformation needed for a better future.

Key elements of Catalytic Resources include:

1.  **Financial Capital**: Providing funding and investment to support innovative projects, initiatives, and organizations that are aligned with the New Vision and Plan. This capital can help kickstart new ideas, sustain ongoing efforts, and scale successful solutions.
    
2.  **Knowledge and Expertise**: Sharing information, research, and best practices to help individuals, communities, and organizations build their capacity, learn from one another, and implement effective strategies and interventions.
    
3.  **Technology and Tools**: Developing and distributing advanced technologies, tools, and platforms that can enable people to collaborate, innovate, and address the complex challenges associated with the [[Meta Crisis]].
    
4.  **Networks and Collaboration**: Creating opportunities for individuals, communities, and organizations to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on joint projects and initiatives. This can help to create synergies, leverage collective resources, and scale impact.
    
5.  **Mentorship and Support**: Providing guidance, mentorship, and support to individuals, communities, and organizations as they navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing the New Vision and Plan. This can help to build resilience, foster innovation, and ensure long-term success.
    

The [[Lionsberg Platform]] and [[Citizen Led]] movement aim to mobilize and distribute Catalytic Resources across various sectors, regions, and stakeholder groups. By doing so, they can help to accelerate the transition to a more just, regenerative, and thriving world, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in and benefit from this transformation.
