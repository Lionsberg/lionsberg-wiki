# 9.4 The differences between the awakened generation and previous generations

The awakened generation is unique in many ways, and differs from previous generations in several key ways. One of the most significant differences is the level of awareness and understanding of the Meta Crisis and the need for a transformational New Vision, System, and Plan. This generation is more aware of the root causes and consequences of the Meta Crisis, and is more motivated to take action to address it.

Another key difference is the level of interconnectedness and global consciousness. The awakened generation is more connected to people and issues around the world, and is more aware of the interconnectedness of all life, societies, and ecosystems on Earth. They are more inclined to think globally and act locally.

The awakened generation is also more focused on collective well-being and the long-term health of the planet, rather than individual success and self-interested economic growth. They are more concerned with the well-being of future generations and the fate of the planet, and are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.

Additionally, this generation is more diverse, tolerant, and just. They are more aware of the social and economic inequalities that exist in the world, and are more committed to creating a more just and fair society for all. They are more likely to embrace diversity, and seek to understand and respect different cultures and perspectives.

Finally, the awakened generation is more open-minded and adaptable. They are more willing to question assumptions and to consider new ideas, and are more open to change and experimentation. They are less likely to be bound by tradition or to accept the status quo, especially when it violates their conscience and inner guide. 

In short, the awakened generation is unique in many ways, and is more aware, more conscious, more inclusive, more just, and more adaptable than many previous generations. They are poised to play a key role in addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.
