# Progressive Articulation

When we immerse our Individual or Collective [[Consciousness]] into [[The Wellsprings]] of Consciousness, we approach the [[Absolute]]. 

What we [[Apprehend]] there is far beyond our ability to [[Comprehend]]. 

What follows we experience as (something like) progressively "pulling" That Which We Apprehend into [[Reality]]. 

Occasionally, entire [[New]] vistas will open and [[Burst In Upon Us]] in relatively complete form. 

However often, we "pull" these little pieces of [[Ultimate Reality]] into our [[Perceived Reality]] one small element at a time. 

At first, it may be only a feeling. Our [[Embodiment]] and [[Mind]] might feel alive and incomplete, as if it Knew on a deeper level that something was longing to come through from [[Beyond]]. 

Then, we might experience a faint image or color. 

Then, we might be able to begin to experience a more complete image. 

As we begin to perceive the image, we can begin to put vague words that point towards elements of it, while wildly missing the mark. 

However once we begin to speak, we can begin to speak more accurately. 

And as we speak more accurately, we [[Differentiate]] various elements of the [[Whole]] we are Apprehending. 

Then we can begin to [[Circumambulation|Circumambulate]] around it, exploring it from various sides, and discovering and articulating new elements of it. 

Eventually, having perceived and received various elements with the [[Right Hemisphere]] and passed those over to the [[Left Hemisphere]] to [[Map]], we can return to the [[Whole]] with a far better [[Understanding]] and [[Perception]] of That Which Is Revealing / Disclosing Itself To us. 

This is the reason [[Lionsberg]] had to be first an [[Idea]] and a Mythical Story. By creating a [[Metaphors|Metaphor]] that gave a Mythical Name to the [[New]], it created the [[Space]] for individuals to each [[Progressive Realization|Progressively Realize]] and [[Wrestle With]] what it pointed at over [[Time]].
