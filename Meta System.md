# Meta System
The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta System** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "System of systems", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible systems.

The idea of the [[Meta System]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our various individual systems with the conceptual [[Meta System]] that is big enough to unite us [[All]].  

All of our systems, whether we acknowledge it or not, are part of the total set of systems contained within the universe. The question is how consciously and competently we are aligning them, individually and collectively. 

For simplicity of understanding, the [[Meta System]] can be broken out into various infinitely nested sub-systems, such as [[Living System]] and the [[Human System]].
