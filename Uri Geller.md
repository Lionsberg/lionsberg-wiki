# Uri Geller

**Uri Geller** (born December 20, 1946) is an Israeli-British entertainer, author, and self-proclaimed psychic known for his claims of **paranormal abilities**, including **spoon bending**, **telekinesis**, **clairvoyance**, and the ability to dematerialize and rematerialize objects. Geller has achieved international fame and notoriety for his performances and alleged psychic feats, becoming a polarizing figure in the worlds of magic, science, and paranormal research. **Dr. [[Andrija Puharich]]** and Uri both attributed these abilities to extraterrestrial contact.
