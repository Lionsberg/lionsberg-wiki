# Meta Goal

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], the term [[Meta]] signifies the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, and most transcendent conception of an idea. Consequently, the **Meta Goal** represents the supreme, overarching, and unifying "Goal of goals" that inherently contains and organizes all other possible goals.

The concept of the **Meta Goal** is crucial as it establishes a framework for aligning our individual goals with the goals of various things we participate in and the **Meta Goal** that is expansive enough to unite [[All]].

Since the term [[Meta]] in the System refers to the [[Absolute]], it is purposefully left abstract to circumvent the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that arises when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]].

The Meta Goal could be described as (something like):

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness._

At a higher level of abstraction, it could be stated that the Meta Goal is the *will and intention* of [[ONE]] / God.

At the highest level of abstraction, the Meta Goal _is_ [[ONE]] / God. 

Realizing this Goal would necessitate solving the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] and achieving the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]].

This is our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Aim]] of the [[ONE]]. It is the perfect diverse [[Unity]] and [[Harmony]] that resides at the End of the [[Logic of Love]].
