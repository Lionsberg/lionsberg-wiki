## Separate Legal Structures: 

1. In order to progress towards shared Goals and Values, members of the Lionsberg Community may from time to time establish various legal infrastructures in various localities around the world. These structures may be members of the Lionsberg Community, and like all members shall remain perpetually independent, autonomous, and self-governing. 
2. To initially protect, steward, and allocate resources in a publicly transparent and accountable way, a separate legal entity, Lionsberg Inc., a 501(c)(3), has been established to promote the Lionsberg System and Approach to designing and building a better world.

## **Conflict Resolution and Accountability:**

1. **Conflict and Disagreement**: Members recognize that in any large group of people trying to communicate and collaborate in community, it is possible that misunderstandings, disagreements, and conflicts may arise.

2.  **Integrity and Trust**: Members are expected to hold themselves and others accountable for their actions, commitments, and contributions to the Lionsberg Community and Commons, fostering a culture of integrity, trust, reciprocity, and mutual support.  Realizing that trust takes time to form, members are expected to respect the process and practices through which trust is built. 
3. **Violations of Values or Trust**: If a member has intentionally or repeatedly violated the shared Wisdom, Principles, and Values of the Lionsberg Community, or failed to fulfill responsibilities or commitments made to other members, the Lionsberg community, through an elected [[Accountability Committee]], reserves the right to take appropriate action, including mediation, restorative practices, or termination of membership, following a fair and transparent process that includes an opportunity for the member to address the concerns raised.
4. **Restoration**: Following a just, transparent, and accountable  process, the [[Accountability Committee]] may explore with the member potential avenues for growth, healing, restoration, and reintegration into the Community, along with specific steps or amends that may be required for that reintegration and healing to occur. 
5. **Termination and Withdrawal of Membership:** Members may voluntarily withdraw their membership from the Lionsberg Community at any time by providing written notice to the community representatives as they may be selected from time to time. A withdrawing member is encouraged to explain their reasons for withdrawal, and share insights or lessons learned during their time as a member. If a member is either voluntarily or involuntarily terminated from Lionsberg Community membership, they may no longer refer to themselves as a member of the Lionsberg Community.
