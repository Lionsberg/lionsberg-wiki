# 13.1 The need for a new operating system and approach

As the rising movement grew, and the Meta Crisis continued to evolve, it quickly became clear that the existing systems and approaches were not sufficient to address the complexity and scale of the Meta Crisis. By 2022, those in movement were feeling encouraged that they were no longer alone, and they were becoming increasingly aware of heroic efforts around the world. However the efforts were fragmented, siloed, under-resourced, and often moving inefficiently in parallel, failing to gain the powerful traction and coordinated scale required. 

The movement realized that it needed a new operating system and approach that could progressively identify, connect, coordinate, and empower the heroic efforts that were emerging around the world.

The challenges facing humanity are unprecedented and require an unprecedented response. The traditional ways of thinking and operating are no longer adequate to address the grand challenges of our time. The Meta Crisis demands a new operating system that can integrate multiple perspectives, disciplines, and scales, and that can foster collaboration and partnership among a wide range of actors and sectors.

The existing systems and approaches are fragmented, siloed, and disconnected. They are not designed to address the complexity and interconnectedness of the Meta Crisis, and they are not capable of fostering the collaboration and partnership that is needed to co-create a better future.

A new operating system is needed that can integrate multiple perspectives, disciplines, and scales, and that can foster collaboration and partnership among a wide range of actors and sectors. A new operating system is needed that can enable the rising movement to coordinate and scale its efforts, and that can serve as the backbone infrastructure and operating system of the New Era once successful. 

The new operating system must be inclusive, just, and regenerative, and must prioritize the well-being of all people and all generations of life on Earth. It must be adaptable and resilient, and must be able to respond to the complexity and volatility of the current era as the Meta Crisis unfolds, and the New World is forged from its ashes. It must be empowering, and must enable individuals, communities, and organizations to take ownership of their own development and to address their specific issues and pain points.

In summary, the rising movement realized that it needed a new operating system and approach that could connect, coordinate, and empower the heroic efforts that were emerging around the world. This new operating system is also needed to serve as the backbone infrastructure and operating system of the new era, and must be inclusive, just, adaptable, resilient, empowering, and able to integrate multiple perspectives, disciplines, and scales.
