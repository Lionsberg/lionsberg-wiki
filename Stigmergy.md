# Stigmergy

_a mechanism of indirect coordination in which the trace left by an action in a medium stimulates subsequent actionsâ€¦ [Stigmergy] enables complex, coordinated activity without any need for planning, control, communication, simultaneous presence, or even mutual awareness. The resulting self-organization is driven by a combination of positive and negative feedbacks, amplifying beneficial developments while suppressing errors._ (Open Civics)
