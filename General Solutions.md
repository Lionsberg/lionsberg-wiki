# General Solutions

The total set of problems, needs, issues and opportunities generally inherent in any human endeavor can be generally classified as [[General Problems]] / [[General Needs]] / [[General Issues]], and [[General Opportunities]]. 

Occasionally, there is a very unique problem, need, issue or opportunity that is uniquely specific to a [[Time]] and [[Space]]. These can be called [[Specific Problems]], [[Specific Needs]], [[Specific Issues]], and [[Specific Opportunities]]. 

[[General Issues]] should be solved through [[General Solutions]]. 

Just as it would be foolish to solve [[General Issues]] as if they were being encountered for the first time, so too would it be foolish to attempt to implement [[General Solutions]] as if they were being implemented for the first time. 

[[General Solutions]] usually require some kind of infrastructure, process, procedure, and guidance to get through. 

In short, each General Solution is its own [[Sub System]]. 

These [[General Solutions]] become like a modular [[Kit of Parts]], contained in a [[Prototype]], that can be localized and instantiated in any domain. The Prototype is like a [[Pattern Of Action]] that can be improved and repeated over and over again. 

Each time a General Solution is implemented, the General Solution should _learn and improve_ as part of the total [[System of Systems]] that is continuously learning and improving.
