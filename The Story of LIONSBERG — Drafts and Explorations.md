# The Story of LIONSBERG — Drafts and Explorations

# Deeper Explorations of Story 


Many of Us can sense that We are in a Time of Crisis,  
And that the stories We were told are UnTrue.  

If [[Jordan's Final Report]] and [[The Great UnVeiling]] are correct,  
We are faced with the task of liberating and regenerating the world  
And Co-Creating a New Civilization — 
Within a single generation.  

What that New Civilization consists of is All of us working together  
To make our lives, communities, and worlds a little better every day.  

This can only occur in the context  
Of the total transformation of Spirit and Consciousness—  
The Great Awakening and liberation of a human species long enslaved.

It requires a New Myth.  
A New System.  
New Processes and Protocols.  
New Covenants and Agreements.  
A New Way of thought, speech, and InterAction.  

It is almost impossible. 
But there is a Way. 

**The Story of LIONSBERG** illuminates it.
