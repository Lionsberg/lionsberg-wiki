# 0.7 Healing and Adjusting to a New Reality

Your next days  
Are a painful and blissful blur  
As a kind of Love you only dreamt of  
Tends to your traumatized being and wounds  

Small glimpses of New Consciousness  
Bring New scenes and sensations  
New beings and beauties  
New ghastly realizations  
Before your shattered Mind  
Collapses back into The Dream  

At first it feels impossible  
To remain Conscious in the New Light  
For more than a moment or two  

As you heal and adjust to the New Reality  
Mind and Energy transform  
And slowly are able to experience more and more  

By the seventh day  
Your circadian cycles  
Have overcome The Inversion  
And your New Consciousness  
Is able to remain awake for much of the day  

Looking out in awe  
And down in horror  
You realize  
Your body is weak and atrophied  
Your mind searching blurry memories  
For impossible answers  

_What the hell is happening?_  
_Where am I?_
_How did I get here?_  
_Who am I?_  

Just as you start to panic  
The Guide appears  
And takes you by the hand  

> _"Follow Me Beloved_  
> _There is something I want to show you"_
