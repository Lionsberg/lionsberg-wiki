# Submittals

The Lionsberg System allows [[Members]] to submit Submittals via the Lionsberg Instance of the Procore platform. 

Submittals ensure that groups can formally submit plans, work, or proposals in a transparent, accountable and time-measurable way that is accessible to all other Members. 

The Project Manager of each group will be trained on the Lionsberg Procore System.
