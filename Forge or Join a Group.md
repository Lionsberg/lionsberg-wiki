# Forge or Join a Group

"Forge or Join a Group" is a key principle in the [[Lionsberg System]]. It refers to the idea that in order to effectively address the [[Meta Crisis]] and co-create a more just, regenerative, and flourishing future for all, individuals must either forge their own groups or join existing groups that share their values and are working towards aligned goals.

By forging or joining a group, individuals can leverage their collective power, knowledge, and resources to take on challenges and Quests that would be impossible to tackle alone. These groups can be local or global, and can take many different forms, from grassroots movements to established organizations to online communities.

[[The Great Game of Lionsberg]] provides a platform for individuals and groups to connect, share knowledge and resources, and collaborate on common goals. By forging or joining groups and connecting with [[Lionsberg]], individuals can find support, inspiration, and strategic partnerships that can help them achieve their goals and contribute to the broader movement towards a more just and flourishing future.
