# 3.5 Progress and Throughput of The Goal

One of the most important concepts of the [[LIONSBERG System]] is the notion of [[Critical Path]] [[Progress]] towards the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]].  

[[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] is the essentially the working definition of [[Value Creation]]. If it does not produce [[Value]], it is [[Waste]].  

The [[LIONSBERG Integrated Delivery System]] emerges from The Great Game to systematize this process over time and accelerate the incarnation of [[Heaven On Earth]].  

Every [[Conscious Agent]] (Individuals, Circles, Communities, Guilds, Bioregions, Worlds, Federations, etc.) should do their best to ensure that their [[Time]], [[Energy]], [[Resources]], and [[Attention]] are fully focused on measurable and meaningful [[Quests]] that advance the [[Critical Path]] by producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]].
