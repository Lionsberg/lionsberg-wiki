# 1.2 Your First Day

Unless you were one of a very few lucky souls, it is likely that like us, you were born into and are emerging out of [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]]. 

Congratulations on awakening and beginning your [[Quest]] towards [[Liberty]], and welcome to [[Life Beyond The Boundary]]. It is a bit bright out here, but we will get used to it. 

Out here in the [[Unknown]], life is quite different. It is extraordinary. It is beautiful. It is purposeful. It is meaningful. It is creative. It is dangerous. It is adventurous. It is **Good**. 

Most of all, it is Real. But it is also [[New]] and different, and it will take some getting used to. 

The biggest difference is that out here, you are [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]] and Free. Unlike life in [[The Caves]], out here there are no [[Employee Consumer Slaves]].  

Out here, we are all equal Co-Creators and Co-Stewards of our individual and collective Destiny. 

Out here, you are the captain of the Vessel of your Existence, and **your Experience will be exactly and precisely what you cause it to be in partnership with the Creator, Creation, and your fellow travelers**. There is no "them" "out there" who can walk the [[Path]] for us, or [[Confront and Overcome]] the [[Challenges]] and [[Obstacles]] that lie in our [[Way]]. It is All up to Us, The People of Earth.  

If something is broken, fix it. If something is lacking, fill it up. If something doesn't belong, remove it. If someone is hurting or stuck, help them. If you are hurting or stuck, ask for help. If you have something to offer, offer it. If you have a need, ask.  

It is up to Us. All of it. [[We Are The Ones We Have Been Waiting For]].  

The moment you find your Self stuck, or wondering what the [[Next Steps]] are, **remember not to look to Authority**. That was the pattern of life in [[The Caves]], but it is deadly Out Here [[Beyond The Boundary]]. There are no Employees out here. 

**Look Within. Talk to your [[Circles]].** If you don't yet have a Circle, **your first task is to forge or join one**. 

Every Circle should be engaged in the most meaningful **[[Seasonal Quests]]** they can design and undertake for that season. If you are talking with your Circles and things aren't clear, go back to the drawing board, clarify your [[Seasonal Quests]] or choose a new one, and get moving again. **Together**. 

As you get into motion and begin communicating to [[The Movement]] about what you are doing and Why, The Movement will be able to help you and your Team better [[Navigate]] and Steer. As [[We Have Heard]] it said: 

>*[[It Is Difficult To Steer A Parked Vehicle]]*
