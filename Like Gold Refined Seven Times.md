# Like Gold Refined Seven Times

The phrase "like gold refined seven times" refers to a process of purification and perfection. It originates from biblical references, notably Psalms 12:6, which speaks to the purity and reliability of God's Words compared to the utmost refinement of gold. The number seven in biblical contexts often symbolizes completeness or perfection. Thus, the imagery of gold being refined seven times conveys not just physical purification to remove all impurities but also a metaphorical process of achieving a state of perfection or highest quality.

In a broader spiritual or moral context, this saying can symbolize the process of personal growth, purification, or sanctification. It suggests that through trials, challenges, and continuous improvement, one's character, faith, thoughts, words, and actions can be purified to the highest standard, akin to the most thoroughly refined gold. This concept resonates with the idea of undergoing significant challenges or a rigorous process to remove flaws or impurities, leading to a state of enhanced purity, value, integrity, and coherence.
