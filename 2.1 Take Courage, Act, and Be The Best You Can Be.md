# 2.1 Take Courage, Act, and Be The Best You Can Be

The antidote to future [[Regret]] and the medicine for the present [[Meta Crisis]] are the same: we must take [[Courage]], act, and exist in the absolute best [[Way]] we can.

To do so, we must strive to [[Being Our Best|Be Our Best]] and [[Doing Our Best|Do Our Best]] at all times, *especially* when the stakes are high and the odds seem insurmountable. This means bringing our full [[Attention]], [[Energy]], and [[Commitment]] to every task, no matter how small or large, and pursuing [[Excellence]] in all that we are and do.

We must also be willing to take risks and embrace uncertainty, *especially* in the face of [[Fear]] or [[Self-Doubt]]. This means stepping outside of our [[Comfort Zones]] and challenging ourselves to grow and evolve as individuals, no matter how uncomfortable or difficult it may be.

Ultimately, taking courage and acting with the fullness of our being requires us to cultivate a deep sense of self-awareness, purpose, and integrity. We must know [[Who We Are]], [[What We Stand For]], and [[What We Are Willing To Fight For]] in the face of adversity.
