# Map Weavers - Summary

Mapping People & Projects  
Updated 5/24/2022

## CURRENT LEADING QUESTIONS

What’s our story so far? What questions are we answering?  What do we need?  Who’s missing?  What’s missing? … 

How to best create an open invitation to new people to join our efforts, while we continue projects already in motion?  

How best to use what has already been created to help onboard and orient people

## THE CHALLENGE

### The need for a Networked Map

  

We are pursuing a database structure that allows each contribution - a person’s experience, passions, resources, projects, groups, etc -  to be connected in many ways.  Creating a networked map removes the silos and allows for that ultimate flexibility. Unlike many tech experiences that are built on hierarchical structures which by design force people to pick the one best place to put something, this allows for the one thing - the contribution - to be networked to and accessible from multiple “parents,” searchable through many different category systems.  Then, in addition, each response is connected to the associated person, organization, resources, etc. to enable easier retrieval and unlock creator potential for collaborative action. 

  

Individuals are requiring features that allow for the flexibility to use and 'view' data in a variety of ways, to best serve their own communities.  One immediate challenge has been in providing people who are less technically savvy a way to navigate through the network in a way that makes sense to them, where they can begin to think in a systems way and understand how they might assist in creating the network and engaging in the system.  This community collaboration is why meeting the requirement for a 'simple map of projects and people’ quickly becomes incredibly complicated.    

  

Our guiding questions: 

Schema: What data types do we want to collect? 

Inputs: Where will the data be coming from?  

Outputs: What do we want to do with the data and/or what visualizations would we like to have?

-   Next: Allow members to add and edit their projects 
    

  

-   Inter-connections - mostly assigned manually within Airtable
    

-   People are connected to Projects
    
-   Both are connected to all comments by others, during and after the 2-min share
    
-   Projects are connected to Societal Sectors (Main, and some subsectors) 
    
-   Projects are tagged with Type of Contribution
    
-   Next: Allow people to edit Sectors, Types and other tags to their Projects
    

  

-   [Data Types / Schema](https://www.catalist.network/explore-data-types)
    

-   Each distinct from the other, Interoperable
    
-   With a Kumu showing their interrelationships
    

  

-   [Kumu Map of Project & People](https://kumu.io/vincentarena/map-weavers-v1) 
    

-   Image of [First Kumu Map of Projects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1093tKedM0I_DfOmSU3SMVfO5-wKdb4On/view?usp=sharing), organized by [Societal Sectors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTwDrVgJFhbqY7R-3vWiLmTCEeF105JM/view?usp=sharing), so we can see what we have and what is missing from major sectors in society
    

-   Starting to look like [this Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1na9nYCcUCGAxfjSMTO_2J8cMco0tsxSv/view?usp=sharing), proposed to Meta Project in March as a basic way to map the projects & people and begin to see the fractals
    

-   Here’s an example of a more detailed Kumu 
    

-   After an event for [The Press Conference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10sov6GTL1GImkfD63Px7cuGVXaDknBzC/view?usp=sharing) 
    

-   Consideration: Interface for map weavers vs. Interface for everyone
    
-   Next Focus: Add more detail to the card for each project within Kumu 
    

  

-   [Tapestry Map of Projects & People](https://www.catalist.network/tapestry-type/map-weavers)
    

-   Demo shows a grid view that shows people and their projects at the intersection of the contribution type with the societal sector
    
-   Allows editing and adding - Integrated with the Catalist platform is ongoing, enabling the use of external editors to provide live refresh of the map as users edit their personal data and add resources for the community. 
    
-   Full [Design Concept](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u8ArWGePCceJK13tAtSS3yjwVyOdyNqN/view?usp=sharing)

-   [Results](https://rqd3h6ew5dk.typeform.com/report/b94sdzRc/WkrSCAVnmnC4AkoM) - showed pretty even distribution. In order: 
    

-   Create visuals/maps from the data we have
    
-   Collect and curate more Profiles & Projects from existing Meta Project members
    
-   Expand data collection from Meta Project members to include ideas, passions & suggested resources
    
-   Provide the data we have formatted in different ways to be exported to other projects/communities
    
-   Collect additional fields of information that allow us to do matchmaking

## GROUP PURPOSE & DISCUSSION THREADS

### SUMMARY

1) Standard visualizations for the Meta Project

2) Ways to continuously improve and evolve the database and visualizations

3) Guide for enabling anyone to map and integrate with what's happening in the community

  

### For Meta Project specifically:

  

Increase Community Engagement with maps

  

-   Top down 
    

-   Overall vision so people know they're in the right place; what's available to do right now; relationships available to integrate next steps
    

-   global 
    

-   Maps to host emergence so that the system can see where it's going 
    
-   Cooperatively organizing and elevating the projects & initiatives towards the Meta Goal
    
-   Forever seeking for and asking whatever is the next right question... So people & groups can orient themselves to that in order to take collaborative action.
    

  

-   group - maps to host potential for collaborative synergies and open opportunities
    

-   An ask of everyone participating to add aligned groups/projects/projects
    
-   Curation of info / composting / harvesting / repository
    
-   Cooperatively adding & editing pieces
    

  

-   individual - maps to connect people with their right next step within the system
    

-   Create visuals for navigation - help Meta members identify what and understand how to take collaborative action towards the Meta Goal.
    
-   Mapping is a key to see synergies/needs/offers in different areas.
    

  

-   Bottom up - needs / offers database; right alignment / effort in the right places; available support (expertise / funding) to meet my need(s); permission from a welcoming environment to contribute
    

  

Processes using maps

  

-   Map Tours: Regularly provide tours of maps that already exist and/or have been created for Meta so everyone can be oriented and learn from them.
    

  

-   Process for ambassadors to reach out and fill the gaps 
    
-   Process for onboarding to help people introduce themselves and find their place within the organization
    

  

Publishing Standards

  

1.  Database structure
    
2.  A few continuously improving standard visualizations
    
3.  Data interchange... and interoperability / how we work together with other people... heading towards some kind of fork and pull model…
    
4.  Independent group that certifies visualizations as accurate reflection of the data - and other groups...
    

  

### Mapping in general

  

Prioritizing / Scheduling

-   Heat map of timing, connections, recognition by multiple people and values all to help make collaborative decisions
    
-   Identifying and choosing urgent use cases
    
-   Mapping problems / bottlenecks...
    

  

Aggregating / Crowd-Sourcing data

-   The graph aspect (or airtable filter) is to map not just by number of "vouches" but the expertise area of the "voucher". Surfacing important efforts that might not be well-known/popular. Weak signals! 🙂
    
-   Super users of different functions…
    

  

Interoperability → these concerns belong in Flotilla

-   Supporting / coming in under / working with others to create new interoperability.
    
-   Enable interoperability across multiple  trusted sources of truth / wisdom... maybe covering different ways of thinking, stages of emergence, etc.
