# Lionsberg 2023.01.18 Pre Flight Checklist 

## Matt
- Thinking about the system and where the right places to intervene are so the system can continue to do its job of improving itself... 


## Preflight Checklist 
- What is most important to pay attention to as we advance? 
- Bill - how we can resource in the maximum possible way to create a center of gravity and support... 
    - Resourcing, support, and provisioning 
    - Core team and infrastructure 
    - Impact Funds 
- Donna Nelham 
    - Financial resourcing 
    - Real systems of work to get things done - without falling into the traps of conventional / hierarchical - yes aren't as loose and permeable and leaky as networks that struggle to get things done. 
    - Commitments and accountability... 
    - The dance with paradox - the holding in some reasonable balance the need for structure, and the need for emergence, the need to stay open treating all of this like a work in progress, along with the need to actually dig in and get things done and continue to calibrate, check, research as we go 
    - the theme of messy humanness... we are all works in progress... we are all messy humans 
    - How we reflect / bring in / invite - 8 billion people without prescribing too much...
- George Orbelian 
    - That we step over the line of asking permission, wondering how - and envision the planet from a functional perspective 
    - In athletics - you plateau and you have to have the visio that is beyond - so that you can get there... 
    - Just brought Steward Cohen on as ED as Buckminister Fuller - let's take the entire Bucky network and align it with what we are doing... 
    - Messy humans - Bucky had the perspective that before earth was designed to point humans could live on it - page 84 of grunch of giants... 
    - All this adaptation, all this crisis, all of these systems have been at it all along... 
    - what has changed is that we used to think dillution was the solution to pollution - disconnect from living system
    - Damaged ecosyste
    - rising population 
    - sharing information across a large group of people 
    - When you share information that is not aligned, and de-genius them - 
    - have not given huans empowered states of flow in relationship to nature... 
    - we have th esolutions, they are on the shelf, just have to implement and do less bad 
    - like coaching - you are fighting yourself there, you could do better there... 
    - we have tuned in automotive 
    - we have tuned in flight and space 
    - Yale 360 - 5.9T in subsidies to oil comapnies in 2020 - how much is goign to things that are regenerative. 
    - set up a way to do less bad
    -  set up MBA type program in concert with BFI - educating family funds... endowments... etc. 
    -  Tom Chi. at one ventures, courses in rapid prototyping... 
    -  put pieces together, give those to the kids and young people getting educated... 
    - Wendy Ellyatt: https://kinshipearth.org/team
    - Chief | Women have always been powerful.
https://chief.com
    - SET UP TASK FORCE... on program... 
        - Wendy working with them on Kinship Earth network 
        - Organization called Chief - women in places of leadership - Barbara Murs - third member of BFI - is a member 
        - Orgs that are trim tabs.
- Wendy E 
    - Stories at every layer - using them to understand what is really going on 
    - understanding the ways in which things are working and not working...
    - The dissonance present in each thing... 
    - Let's explore the different layers... 
    - Inside of every pair of people, lots of assumptions adn values that don't get brought out. 
    - Understanding at each point whether we are going along a trajectory of better... 
    - Or are on the wrong track... 
    - Otherwwise good people fall out of love and process easily, or stick together when they shouldn't 
- Judy 
    - the connectivitis of each different layer 
    - how we connect together 
    - become aware of and track the initiaties going on in lots of different places 
    - enormous movement and momenet in time 
    - our unique ability is perhpas to look at the interface of execution and human nature 
    - Looking at enabling as the primary function...
    - The key is to enanble awareness, thoughtful planning, and returning along the way... 
    - Continuous learning dimension - how that is developed and made available to other people... 
    - Enabler not executer... 
    - Diagram of the structure and how things relate to one another... hardest part of what we are trying to do, bcause of diversity and intrinsic differences in the critical issues in each area... 
    - will influence hte communicaations, strategic thinking... 
    - pay regular attention to role clarity... 
- George 
    - Disaster preparedness community could be fantastic fit for us to integrate our thoughts with 
    - Should be engaged in the planning as well 
- Judy 
    - part of the job is to envision the disasters that haven't happened yet 
    - Risk analysis piece - often unique to the entity... once you ahve done that - who else might face this... 
    - Nature of evolving thought and connectivity... 
    - Sharing knowledge across the network... 
    - Chumash indians - planning for floodwaters, sea level rise... who hadn't been consulted in the inception of these programs with the state government... 
    - Each person and org tends to only look at their point of view, and not ask what is oppositional point of view... 
    - What are the mechanisms? 
    - The connectivity piece is a unique area of focus... 
    - We will lose out if we don't conect - solutions might be oppositional, different things work in different parts of the world
    - Comprehensive and participatory design science - wehn you look comprehensively, start realizing they are a beautiful synergy of cascading benefits... 
    - the untapped potential about the regenerative economy... the pieces that come together, and all of a sudden the conditions are there for everything to take off... 
    - There will be disrupters, some change adverse, who will do everyting possible to disrupt... 
- Jason 
    - How to approach complex space 
        - Creating the conditions that create the systems that allow people to learn and adapt 
    - how to approach chaotic space 
        - how to respond to random but predictable disasters... 
    - Thinking of hypotheses 
        - What is the hypothesis of Lionsberg to test in next 90 days... 
        - Given what Lionsberg is - what are the experiments in each of our domains that can be testing something... 
    - Jason has 4 spaces he is playing in, each with different learning edges, and for instance governance... 
    - use a governance apply it and see if that enables us to achieve what we want to achieve... 
    - 2 or 3 places we can test measurement systems.. in networks, in poverty action groups... 
    - Two spaces - what is testing and learning in Lionsberg
    - What is being tested in various communiites - and how can that be brought into a structure and shared back out... - Key function - the breathing in and breathing out of information... 
    - Wendy E
    - Institutions on one side 
    - Movements on the other 
    - each can be good or bad in various groups 
    - Overlap is the enablers 
    - Grow the enablement space 
    - Need governance and structure in the world... movement and institutions - overlap is the enablers... 
    - just enough structure, just enough of a movement... 
    - The stories are an overlap between the two... 
    - The criticality where there is enough of something, a disposition in the system that can begin to solve many things... 
    - To do the numbers to see how close to criticality you are getting - close to dave snowdens work, complex adaptive, etc... 
    - YOu can anticipate the systems... 
    - end up pushing the problems around... 
- Michael 
    - ask and offer for clarification.... around the 3 levels of analysis... 
    - existing entities striving towards the same goal 
    - idea of connecting - and not placing ourselves in either an executional spot or a coordinating spot 
    - if you see the first level goal - the meta goal / meta project / nameless project - before us and after us and with us 
    - then the second level is all the orgs, entities, people's philosoophies working towards the higher goal in smaller goals but may or may not see themselves as part of the goal - haven't conceived of it that way - have their own agenda - may be local, specialized, siloed in some way... 
    - From the third level - which is were we are - which is below - which is power in service of in followership -
    - can use observation, reporting, who is working towards the goal without knowing it, do our best to observe, publicize, celebrate... 
    - All of us working in this group - all working in different entities - and how that differentiates from Lionsberg 
    - The coordinated followrship 
- George 
Our bare feet connect humans to our earth:

Shoespiracy - a short film created by VivoBarefoot
- Elibabeth 
    - There are aspects and functions being performed in layer two
    - what is being called into existence - is trying to get our arms around the missing pieces, start to try to activate in support of goal 1... 
    - We are going to create a fund - but there are lots of funds in layer 2 already... 
    - What layer 3 initiates - tensions - 
- All funds may go into layer 2 - the awareness and coordination layer - raising the undersatnding of the whole - that is what is missing... 
    - Governments try to do it 
    - WEF tries to do it 
    - but realistically most of what is happening is a layer two game... 
- What if we created global fund and put into preseraation / back into community stewardship 
    - Anything that is orged is a leyer two game... 
    - the view of the total system of systems 
    - that is transcendent of governments and the old regime 
    - to identify and lift into the work plan 
    - which needs the arms and legs of layer two 
- George 
    - one way to get there is to create a nature centric platform 
    - if we get too stable and bored we change or mess it up 
    - nature based systems with codes - when we see nature is hurt we are hurt too... 
    - there is no bad guy - there is no opinion... 
    - it is a health healing... then it is relevant... 
- Wendy M 
    - another wave of increasing energy, momentum urgency... 
    - Huge step forward in the three layers on the way we can talk to one another, explore teh energy between the layers, and enable the layers enable 1 and 2... 
    - I am a weaver in sapces, ecosytem mapper, and particularly interested in enagement of people in spaces ofinception and are looking to collaborate.. 
    - What gets us to lean in, why do we lean in, bringing that knowledge into spaces like this to talk about how we can emerge together what comes next... 
    - How do we begin to operationalize and see what is in the entire ecosystem... 
    - request from many groups... 
    - Wendy and Vincent - finished the prototype for the data collected last April...
    - Hooray! 
- Judy 
    - I think enabling is a key feature, which requires attention to themes, challenges, successes, etc.
- Bill 
    - the parable of the blind men and the elephant 
    - to bring oppositional people into the mix is really important 
    - broad perspective, beyond siloes... 
    - The idea of the North star.... 
    - Personality tests... 
    - Unanticipated consequences of our own well meaning actions 
    - and input of people we might not want input from... 
- Donna 
    - Interoperability across enabling tech to foster collaborative exchange…is also key…
- Killu 
    - I really like the concretization of the models 
    - And there is something really big missing... 
    - Unanticipated consequences... 
    - and how it ties to waht is missing... 
    - Emergence, the openess, to what we didn't see coming 
    - openness to being helped by people who connect us to other people, information 
    - Forces we don't have names for... 
    - Things you didn't see coming happening... 
    - A way that we can bring into the system, structure and anticipate into the system 
- Matt
    - Disrupters, the whole and what is missing 
    - When I look at every org referenced today, pattern of conversation used today 
    - what is missing is the acknowledgement that we are complicit... 
    - the words we use are complicit in the construct of humanity 
    - Because we are all complicit (in the destruction of the habitable universe that humans can be a part of...) 
    - Enablers may not be what is needed - 
    - we might have made some grand mistakes along the way... 
    - struggling with coming to terms with what amounts to suicide of a species... 
    - energy around actons that are built into the economic systems... 
    - Money is involved... when money is involved - it is going to fail to create that change... 
    - to allow us to escape the gravity that we are all a part of... 
    - breathing our plastics... 
    - we may just need to stop... 
    - how to rationalize it, recongize it, come to terms with it... 
- I would concur we are thinking of it as if we are above it and can affect more than we can affect 
    - awareness of our negative contributory role... 
    - we have messed it up... 
    - I don't see willingness to own that 
    - the balance of thinking of the whole and self-preserving interests... 
- How we progressively shift energy from the old to the new... 
- The manhattan project of all things...
