    - one big onboarding checklist template
    - customized for each incoming person

## Roles
- Facilitator / coach
- Mentors

## Processes
- Someone has an idea... to setting up a thing... that can grow at the wise right time
    - And the way we hold one another in that process... 
    - Seeing everything as an experiment... what did we learn... how ideas are generated... 
- A PLACE FOR COLLECTING GEMS - for people to drop in what they think are gems that could be acted upon...
    - How you deal with various levels of resistence / support / hesitation... 
    - This ties to idea of Generative Commons... 
- EXPERIMENTS
    - Portfolio approach... 
    - Investing along a portfolio of things... 
    - Intrinsic motivation - following gut feel that I am doing the right thing... 
    - doing a set of things... 
    - and the ones that get extrinsic feedback - feels good and helps me allocate more energy
    - other things you just do because they are the right thing to do... 
    - Instrinsic motivation - am I on the right track, or do I have something and keep going... 

## Concepts

- something between Social Dimensions and Tool Makers, call it Sociology Architecture (or something). Sociology Architecture handles
    - how we everybody uses the platforms and tools
    - an overall architecture and reasoning of what we do, and why _these_ tools
    - UX review and feedback for the Tool Makers
    - onboarding people to tools.
- concierge/onboarding role
- A hierarchy or depth of engagement... 
    - From meta project (loose mapping of all similar things that may or may not want to play together but maybe should)
    - To Meta Project (people who are starting to vaguely work together...)
    - To Lionsberg or another named thing that is a closely co-operating community... 
    - and how we progressively invite people deeper into right relationship with one another
- Where do I fit in? 
    - From curiosity
    - To how energy builds / flows and is managed over time...
- Every person lost due to friction / lack of energy is a loss to All

## Questions

How do we invite participation from visionaries without making them feel like they are

- entering an arena where they are competing in service of “their vision”
- giving up “their vision” to become followers?

## Generative Commons
- Where can gems be gathered, dropped, tagged... super essential... 
- Some boundaries, set of criteria, categories, 
- Need trove cultivator / maintainers... 
- See who is working on / advocating for certain things... that become a knowledge repository that can get pulled out... 
- PM Tags to track the development through various stages...
