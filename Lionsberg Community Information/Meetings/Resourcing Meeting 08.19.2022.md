### Update from Jordan
- Half of Jordan's time organizing impact projecs and initiatives present, half with capital - and potentially [Future Capital](https://www.futureofcapital.org/) (connection to UN and major capital flows - idea to not compete but collaborate with synergies on a major level). it is not a divided effort, rather, Future Capital is considering folding into Lionsberg structure so they benefit from LB, and bring the benefit of Future Capital works - still in service of the single meta goal. Not a pivot. Lawrence Ford founder of https://www.consciouswealth.global/. We'll see what happens. 
- In Lionsberg structure that no one owns, set up to support many initiatives


## Feedback 
- Forrist: what would be useful from this resourcing group - altered, changed? Impact?
- Bill: this is a substantial answer to the question of how to find resources to energize what we are doing - as resources are opening up through this. Building infrastructure takes time. This is interesting as it correlates with all values, goals and resources them. Has potential to energize more participation (incuding Jordan's) in a more focused way, rather than dialing for dollars. Will be resources to compensate people who are important contributions, not sure yet how. 
- Killu: Lawrence Ford has been working on conscious capital for a while and this is very aligned
- Jordan: recognized we are working on the same thing, need dynamic leadership and catalyzing some action. Take streams of lifetimes of work and align. We are creating a very powerful energy that lots of things and resources can start converging. It Might Work. 
- Judy: senses this is very big and important we are trying to do, rich dimension. Couple ways to look: be opportunistic, identify best ones; at same time would like to think strategic where things are moving to and where are the most ciritacl paths, will explode in complexity
- the balance of strategic and opportunistic 
- Where is the world moving to, and what are the most critical paths... Advisory functions are important - ag, water, social, other zones (knowledge, guidance, wisdom and help) Our job is to keep a good look at the big picture to zoom in to detail where something needs to be fixed so it won't become critical obstacle.
- Watching the critical zones, and catalyzing action in the zones we think are critical, where nothing is coming...for us to watch what is coming to meet it 
- Next week's pull planning 8/24 - 17 SDGs, pull back milestones, get relationships built, critical path determined.
- Jordan: SDGs plus social issues - 25 total or so - if each had a fund+ advisory + XPrize style contest, then start to fill out the mosaic of pieces that need to move together. Want a working map to see missing gaps, strategically filling in.

## Missing Link Issue
- Judy: missing link question - funders,finders early inventors didn't know there was an obstacle, stumbling block, surprises the team. Might converge on it with people to provide solution. Experience with intuitional feeling of where there may be something here - an imporatnt role of advisors, to bring in consciously vs unconscious level of early impementers who are often blind to whree gaps occur. Richness of this community could be very helpful here.
- Intuitives watching over the field could be useful. "I'm not sure and I'm maybe nervous about...", someone else helps to articulate what first one can't. If get 50% addressed early, saves a lot of time, momentum, backtracking.
- Rapid digital tools for gathering on pattern level data  - Wendy E, others - anonymous gathering of content across large group (Windtunneling.com) - used with goverments, counties, Forrist has access. Keep eyes on what is emerging in AI, other tech realms. Find someone who is knowledgeable to give feedback so adoption neither too early/late, gives great leverage
- Intuitional Feeling of a threat in a particular zone - if this kind of thing happens... 
- A PROCESS - "I am not sure and I am maybe nervous about"
- A process for PROGRESSIVE ARTICULATION... 
- IMPORTANT ADVISORY ROLE
- Mandate to ask for billions (not sure it will work), then seek 10% (or some %) to build tools etc. needed to take field forward. In 90-100 days could have a stream of resources coming in, with advisory groups doing this, with panels of experts, lining up tools, projections, budgets - then making total toolset available to all organizations moving in service to the goals. 
- https://www.catalyticthinkinglabs.com/pages/jane-lorand - seems almost perfectly designed for early emergent work... 
- https://windtunneling.com/


## DIGITAL TOOLS
- Gathering data at a pattern language
- Wendy E
- Wind Tunneling - windtunneling.com - we have access to the founders..
- Emerging tech realms of AI etc... 
- "Missionaries" to each role - feedback to the group... 
- Adoption neither too early or too late - the right tipping points of evidence. 
- We ought to be mindful of the coming structural change of radical personal transparency in area of reputation. Through DID -digital identification where the individual chooses at what level to disclose to others. 
- These could be used today. They are available. Transparency is a powerful cleansing as the light loves it and the dark... not so much.

## Danger: Forces that want to Coopt Money and Power 


- As oon as resources show up, coopting money shows up, not malicious 
- "Power Accumulators" will quickly rush in - how to develop organizational immune system
- honest trust and sincere belief to be at heart of advisory groups. Anticipating consequences, such as people coming later trying to coopt.
- Want people who are gifted people who care - smart, experienced, discerning, able to prioritize
- Very important - not to take anything emerging here and subordinating to existing organizations. Instead, keep understanding it will take many different organizations, capitals
- 
## Consideration and Theory of Evil
- We are not tuned up to look for the abberant behavior 
- Mechanism to be watchful 
- How do we think about and talk about this... 
- Charismatic sociopaths... 
- Susan davis Mora - Kins network - spiritual formula - not the charisma of an individual - but what has been their impact in the world
- Forrist - scientific tools on personality analysis, thinking types for various roles, that when you get it right everyone thrive... 
- How to forge diverse teams... 
- use impact already made in the world to evaluate fit and quality of people for these projects
- What is the type of thinkning skill that is appropriate for (each different) role, leads ot thriving
- Build in charismatic sociopath exclusion mechanisms
- Workshop to do with people about how different systems function in a body- 
    - And how that might manifest in the emergence of a global body... +

## Charisma
- Charismic Distraction 
- and also maybe causes us to miss gems from people who are not charismatic... 
- Persistance in pushing why something should happen - is a diagnostic... 
- Don't want to exclude people who have been trained in a particular way (MBA's) 
- Discernment 
- Training 
- "Help me understand...Given what you just said, how would you respond to X...tell me more about how you are thinking...That's an unusual way to look at it - why don't you take it a little farther and see where it takes you (how they choose to elaborate gives you appreciation of their framework and values; enabling discernment by questions, empowering people to find solutions rather than coming to you for solutions) - themes for discernment and processing
- how we examine propositions, outcomes, proposals... 
- Training people who were trained a particular way (in current world, to get investment, you need to be x, like "assertive, leaning in, persuasive, never give up"), and to train them to be a different way
- (Need both discernment of who to go with, who not to, and training of potential in those "not yet there but able to upshift through training and will"
- Pivotal MOMENTS often shape this discernment ability... not easily trained... 

## Exclusion, inclusion, homogeneity
- Let's also find ways to include people who don't have time, resources, but want to be part of this
- Notion of Meta Corps a la Peace Corps, Americorps, to allow people to afford to work wiht us who otherwise can't afford to work with us (time, money, other resources) - can we create a lower level corps that people can volutneer for and derive benefit from (Michael)
- Jordan - idea of equipping everyone with some experiential bandwidth to move society forward in a beneficial way
- Compile list of carefully chosen discerning questions to make it a tool to use
- many won't have resources we have, like technology and knowhow - competing features in organizational progression 
- People with different financial backgrounds and capacities to engage. Spending funds to put together a team that can provide structure, and governance, and guidance, and protection, is huge benefit to project and donors will want to see it in place with structure and oversight (vs committees like foundations and investment groups have). To have something beyond that, to look at protection and guidance, will be of great value. Unusual to see. Pull planning to include component for something that can presented after and as perform that function and integrated into the structure - funders wil llove to see that. 
- Platforms to connect people with projects to be done in meaningful amounts of time - billions of professional hours donated to nonprofits already now - is a very heavy lift on organizations to manage the churn well. What we need is solution for the highly skilled porfessionals to use these skills in a way to regenerate planet and lifts their depresion and fears about future, without being shown solutions currently outside radar of where they are working. 
- Direction of creating permissionless employment. Tokens that may not turn into cash.
- Pilot
- Massive leverage of huge economic resources, mindset, from those delivering resources. Impact of massive ripple effect.
- Vision of massive numbers of skilled people being able to log in, see what is needed, go do it. Integrated delivery guide speaks to it.
- Look at it in terms of specific people to work full time using shared technology - who are they, what would it take, what would that make possible - specific organizations as examples, all raising funds right now in this group - can we agree to work across multiple brands - marketing, networking/connecting across different nodes and networks.

## FOUNDATIONAL STEPS
- What are the key foundational steps: 
    - Clarity of what is in and what is out - BK Fuller
    - Incredible value of diversity of thought
    - Ways to be with tension that arises from diversity
    - CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION
        - holding a different mindset aroudn conflict
        - Anti-fragility
        - makes us stronger
    - The whole slew of mindset things that come into play
    - What are the soft stuff that needs early attention
- What are the potential flaws or threats to systems - and how can we engage others in the discernment process... 
- Need to develop a whole culture of humanity that supports a different way of interacting with more knowledge / thought / discernment... 

## Representation of Various Skill Sets in Different Groups
- Ensure there are 2 or 3 people with this (ability) in each working group, area, etc. 
- Proactive mechanism to percolate discernment through the system
- teach people how to be wise and discerning
- Then pool those resources in a usable way... 
- Treasures that be coordinated in little groups.. 

## Grappling With the Vulnerable Period of Emergence
- charismatic sociopath exclusion mechanisms... (CSEM)
    - 
- Vulnerable to get right in early stages of formation

## CULTURE OF FLOW
- speaking from the highest place 
- Finding the very best ways in which we can make / model / teach / require set up structure and process to value opportunity to flow together... 
- Have set very soon how to create a culture of coherence and ability to set it up, repair when broken, and apply it - and then instill, require, model, teach it in/from/to others so they benefit from the efficiencies of working in flow (not creativity based flow necessarily, but flowing together, bringing in what is needed from the field we all tap into together as a group in discussing and building something in practical world)

## Forrist 
Specific criteria the proposal looking for when building these advisory and manifestation networks (excerpt follows)
Candidates should meet the criteria below:
• Have high credibility in their constituency;
• Give back strongly in that constituency;
• Have a reputation for integrity;
• Be known for advanced collaboration skills;
• Be conscious that we are all one;
• Be passionate about conscious sustainability;

Here's a primary for KINS Networks - https://ln.sync.com/dl/a15217db0/9uvjrysr-bcgmw8a8-qqm38i8b-q72mbwjr
The acceleration of solar, impact investing and women's movements in the last several years can be traced to groups started using this model from 20-30 years ago.

## DISCERNMENT
- Success depends on discernment of individuals and groups like this - need to develop a cultureof humanity that supports a different way of interacting, with more knowledge and discernment - how train it
- Onboarding process into discernment and culture training - need develop progressive onboarding mechanism
- Oversight committees dealing specifically with ethics - to serve other aspects and essence of the organization - Erik's example/invitation - need proactive mechanism to percolate discernment through a system
- Danger of corruption, giving resources without ethics - Nigeria example (Bill) as rich corrupted area - need for establishing transparency at the outset

## Final preflight checklist notion
- This was a very valuable discussion, by non-self-centered group - like a preflight checklist
- Next couple weeks continue further with how we deal with resources in the system in an ethical, transparent, appropriate way. Maybe Future Capital takes off some pressure to go find resources. 
- Use purity of this group to get to transparency, governance questions - treat as precursor to getting resources in
- If we bring resources in, what are the most likely dimensions we could fail along, what are primary protections to spot these really early
- eye towards failure points for grwing quickly, checks and balances, structural pattern integrity before too much growth occurs

## MetaCorps
- Allows people the affordance to work with us who
- would like to spend more time and can't afford it... 
- Some volunteer for...  

## The Right Questions
- Very carefully compiled discernment questions... 
- Help people collct things troubling them
- or helpful to them 
- Very interested in key principles we would want to create a field of, from our life experiences collectively gathered - even if we on'dt know how to implement it yet - principles we should be honoring in these stages - reviewing them helps us keep them alive, diagnose problems
- We don't know the right answer but we know lots of things that could blow this up. Having lots of people observe might give us more freedom

## The Right Principles 


## The Right Practices 

## The Right Pace 

## REsourcing
- a team that can provide structure, wisdom, protection, oversight... 
- Specifically looking at the protections, the guidance, 
- Pull planning needs to address every cluster / circle / pod that needs to be represented, so that we can constitute those and implement them 

## LImited Time
- liberating engagement for those with limited time
- Uber, AirBnB - making invisible things visible 
- there is a time people have that is avaialble but not well used - that could well be used in a way that is inspired and energized to help them impact the world 
- breaking the either or 
- to liberate many people's time and presence and engagement so they don't have to leave where they are at. 
- And where time and value they can bring could be harnessed beyond volunteering... 
- teh abundance of the possible available time and expertise and engagement in a way that is current not harnessed well.. 
- some technological 
- some community based 
- some cultural 
- beyond the old notiion of volunteering at a food bank 
- and taking available time and expertise and making it immediately valuable and doable... 
- Connect up professionals with projects they can accomplish, get deliverable done in a meaningful amoutn of time, interacted just as if they are being paid... multiple billions of dollars of that kind of time donated to non-profits (usually large one)
-  Forrist - it is a very heavy lift for the org to level that amount of churn welll
-  Need and solution - for highly skilled people wihtout way to contribute, tht also lifts depression and fear, because they are fed fearful messages, without being engaged in solutions... 
-  Hypha - creating permissionless empoloyment... core team being paid... articulating the sprints, what are the roles, deliverables, comp mix between tokens and $... measurement of energy and cash... 
    -  From nascient into pilot 
    -  then pilot into replication
    -  that creates massive leverage of untapped huge economic resources with cascading benefit for all... 

## Discerning Next Steps
- Forrist offers to facilitate call with Jane of Catalytic Thinking Lab -positive tool - could synchronize with Wendy E's content understanding - objectifies wisdom so it can be catalyzed into well founded trust
- Compile list of carefully chosen discerning questions to make it a tool to use
- Compile listof carefully chosen Principles 

## Mid Term Targets
- Large funds around each of UN SDGs
- X-Prize style contests around each of the Global Goals
- Working Groups / Expert Groups around each of the Global Goals / Grand Challenges 
- Knowledge, guidance, wisdom and help will get big fast...
