## Topics
- Review the chat from the workshop 
- Did we capture the "lost" offers and needs? 
    - How do we want to follow up this week? 
- Process Improvement - 
- Distinction between offers people are willing to contribute to "the project", vs. available to anyone in the community... 

## Review of Chat / Feedback
- Project Plan 
    - We didn't have a project plan for the roll out of a needs and offers marketplace 
    - Here are the goals and approach and plan... 
    - then we retro it. 
    - More highly differentiated goals / criteria for each session... 
        - That we then judge / retro against... 
- Context
    - Framework 
        - what is a need
        - what is an offer
        - what is a marketplace
        - what might we do if we had a needs and offers marketplace? 
    - What we are doing for what purpose
        - We are endeavoring to do something together... 
        - Differentiating 
            - Office / starbucks bulletin board... that apply to people in workplace, not having to do with the work
            - Vs. offers to projects in service of the higher goal
            - Vs. offers to the highest level of abstraction...
        - We understand the goals of the (Company)
        - The discernment to differentiate whether that is actually the right need... you are asking for the wrong thing... 
    - The build up of layers of why... how... 
    - Issue of understanding what the market is, before you try to play in it... 
        - Personal needs and offers
        - Vs. group needs and offers
        - vs. public context 
- Questions
- Timing
    - Time felt rushed... time to come to understanding on context, questions, etc. 
    - 
- Variation
    - Varying content and style might require some postprocessing... 
    - The structure is different from need to need / offer to offer... 
- Follow through
    - How to make it attractive, engaging... 
    - 

## Process Improvement
- If we ran it again, how might we contextualize and frame it differently? 
- Maybe Prepare and Express asynchronously in advance... 
- Then use time together to clarify and improve...? 
- Doing something in advance to kind of flesh out kind of who you are and what you're passionate and what you'd like to be doing, in what percentages, and what you need... 
- Define Different types of personas that play in the marketplace... 
    - And how each type wants to play 
    - and how we facilitate that. 

## Project Plan
- what are we tryiing to accomplish 
- why
- how important is each element 
- What is a good Project Proposal Template? 
    - Needs - expressed as stories - reconciled and prioritized - that hte group can act one... 
    - in addition to - one offs. 

## Next Steps
- Jordan to send out email contextualizing... 
    - Leading to project plan... 
    - Vincent to set upworking meeting to go through needs and offers not captured...
    - Then figure out how to export and share...
- Sharing out offers... 
- Needs expressed as stories, compiled into epics and sagas - that inform Product Development Roadmap (or something similar to that idea)
    - Expressed as a project proposal?

## How shall we frame the workshop?
- concentric circles of "to whom": 
    - those present in the meeting 
    - all members of the meta project 
    - all members of catalist 
    - the world 
- levels of impact:
    - personal (i need)
    - group (we need or i offer to the group)
    - collective mission (needs from pull planning, offers to the whole)

## Good Quotes
- "Feed two birds with one Scone"
- "Feeding many birds with one stone soup"
- Possibly meta project can be a service-provider for educational content/processes in doing these sorts of exchanges.
