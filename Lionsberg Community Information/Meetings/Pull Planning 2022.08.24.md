# Pull Planning 2022.08.24

Lean philosophy identifies 60-70% waste across all industries. We want to be best, most efficient. Begins by aligning on the overall vision and goal, coarsely stated and then gradually filling in details.

## Agenda

    - [x] identify and assign key roles
    - [x] add stickies to our [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPc2HLgQ=/) covering five decades  
- [ ] what has shown up, what do we do next?
    - [ ] capture the chat content
    - [ ] edit the miro for timeline
    - [ ] develop the sum total of ideas into something coherent and navigable
