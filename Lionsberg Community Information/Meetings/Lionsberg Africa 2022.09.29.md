    - 20 days to make 10k bricks for 3 classrooms... then raising labor... 270k is materials in one trip...   


## Project to Fund the Schools
- Every home has a traditional bee hive... 
- Honey from (that area) is among hte best in Kenya - Kenya only produces 20% of what it needs, import 80% - there is great demand. 
- That land is always green... next to hill that never drives... 
- Install 2,000 modern hives... 
- if you harvest only once per year, get 10 kilos of honey per hive, 80% success rate, harvesting 1,600 hives / year... each kilo of honey 800 KS - each hive gives you 8,000... harvesting 1,600 hives... 12M KS... if we sell as raw honey... sell 500 KS / kilo... 8M KS per hive... good weather up to 3 hives... 
- which is enough to pay teachers, buy uniforms, buy food... 
- On top serving school, training school for locals to upgrade traditional bee keeping methods... 
- Also value addition... 
    - Wax, 
    - Venoms...
    - Medicines...  
    - etc...
- Can run both Nairobi and Pokot at same time... 
- 1 hive installation costs 6,500 KS... hive is 5,500 plus 1,000 plus labor.... 
    - $55 USD... 
    - within the first 6 months usually first harvest... 
    - 10 kilos... = 8,000 KS... 
- Edwin - is professional bee keeping training... 
    - Tobby also trained... 
- Concentration - 
    - Normally spread at distance of 1 meter from each other... 
    - given environment in Kenya - have quite a lot of bees... population of bees is sufficient to colonize all the hives... 
    - Fill up 3-5 hives in a day or two... 
- Revolving Loan Fund 
    - Fuels the build out of of a network of businesses that fund the operation of schools. 
    - Loans for farming depending on natural patterns - will go beyond your control... 
- With 2,000, can run up to 3 schools... 
- Job Creation / Employment
    - many many young people looking for opportunity... 
    - Learning to make hives our selves... 
- The Management and Accountability
- Job Creation 
    - Do we run 2,000 hives? 
    - Or set up a network of businesses... 
    - How many people working full time to manage 2,000 bee hives? 
        - Run it section by section... 
        - Every section segmented in groups of 50 hives... 
        - monitoring and inspection 
            - monthly cycles
            - And as they are getting colonized...
            - 2 month period just let bees settle in, get used to environment... 
            - then two month cycle inspecting the hives... 
- Edwin's operation
    - 3 or 4 people to manage... 
    - Do it in cycles of two months... 
    - because of inspection time able to tell when there is a ready harvest... 
    - able to schedule a harvest job for those that you have identified as ready... 
    - 1 person that is living nearby... make sure there are no disturbances... keep an eye on things... 
    - The other ones come and go... 
    - Bees are less demanding, not daily work... 
    - once colonized, just keep an eye on things, make sure they are not disturbed... 
    - A couple days to do the inspection - with 2 or 3 helpers... 
    - Harvest - 2 or 3 days... 
    - 1 person watching, then just work with casuals who are properly trained... 
- 2,000 hives, 50 hive segments, 40 segment... 
    - each box functions on its own schedule... 
    - 1 queen in each box... lays 2,000 eggs per day... is all boxes occupied 4,000,000 eggs per day... 
    - land so productive... 
    - really improve the value of the land... 
- Oranges would also do well there... Mangos... 
    - Passion fruits..

    - Get 3 more quotes... 
- $10,000 Loan Fund
    - $2,300 to buy materials 
    - $55 / hive x 100 = 5,500
    - subtotal of 7,800
    - Leave 2,200 of labor for the buildings and hives... 
        - if we used 150,000 KS for materials for a 4th buildng
        - $1,200
    - Harumbe... 
- 20,000 KS / acre... 
- Trees... 
    - 15 KS Eucalyptus
    - 100 to 200 Fruit trees... 
- EDWIN - is accountant... 


## Final Hypothesis
- Lionsberg will try to help line up $10k loan fund. 
- Loan fund will be used to: 
	- Buy materials for 4 classrooms
	- Buy 100 bee hives
	- Use remaining $ to secure supervisory labor to lead a "Harumbe style" raising where church and local community come together to make it happen. 
- By doing 4 buildings instead of 3, class size is equaled at 50 with 50 children in early childhood development, and 50 in grade 1. 
- This then creates the need to build 2 classrooms per year. 
- Construction done by October / early November... 
- Certification of the school by November / December... 
- Start school with 100 students in January... 
- Government certification of the school will trigger local government providing teachers and food... 

## Food for Thought... 
- Jordan also wants to explore whether Lionsberg should increase the size of its microfinance experiment in conjunction... 
- Two loan pools
	- One microfinance to fuel business startups and economic flow... can partner with Jamii Bora foundation if we'd like to... 
	- One for school and business construction...
