- Old / Dictating structure - 
- Inviting and forcing the practice - how can we engage with illuminated capital in a way that the energetic of engagement is a practice of a new way of being.. 
- Not easy to get out of - has to be entirely recirpical outcome to practice ourselves into a new playing field.

## Issues
- Financial proforma / modeling 
- Forrist - need to put focus on telling this story - with the kind of people very skilled in doing this
    - 15 minutes
    - then the layering to get deeper
    - Then using that to attract organizations such as PC etc... to engage the System... 
    - Courtship and engagement patterns..
    - What happened... why... what was done as a result... 
- Agreements and "enforcement mechanisms" to start to walk it into being... 
- Different levels of returns for different forms of capitals 
- Generational wealth and equity transfers 
    - Majority of companies are not venture backed... financially it is just fast growth / fast equity... 
    - A multi-generational system does not have to look for fast growth... 
    - 100 year plans... 
        - Speak to Japanese / other countries on how they look at 100 year plans... 
- Massive amounts invested in causes that are anti-thetical to the state vision / vision / values of the organizations 
- Each person that engages is a new dendrite...

## Long Term 


## Post Conversation 
- Practical Question of dealing with evil...

- Can that minimum viable thing be non-redundant.. .
- Chemical term - nucleation - one tiny crystal... 
- Quality control 
- Michael
    - If you have a micro goal... and someone proposes a credit union... 
    - if you have a micro goal... and someone proposes Just Works. www.justworks.com 
    - they look super attractive. 
    - Lionsberg gives the sense... that we are creating a structure where... 
        - if teh highest and greatest goal we are seeking... 
        - If the meta project is the end to that goal....
        - Lionsberg is creating a model to empower everyone engaged... the sturucture that supports everyone in getting to that goal. 
- Personal develpment / organizational / community transformation... 
    - supportive... 
- What's In, and What's Out
    - What are the mechanisms of defining what is in
        - Values
        - As inclusive as possible but also as clear that creates a frequency of resonance that draws people that align, and dispels those who dont.. 
    - There will still be those who come in as disrupters - wolf in sheeps clothing... 
        - method that is clear / equitable fair to stimulate a PROCESS to move that out... 
        - Energy of Love
        - Energy without Love
- Immune system... 
    - clarifying that strongly early on... 
    - energetically creating the frequency... that draws onto it that which resonates with coherence... 
    - while setting up a field that will cause others to deselect... 
    - the lack of clarity... creates caution.. of those who have todiscern.. 
- A game... that allows us to call each other out... 
    - a process
- There are wolves in the ecosystem.. 
- The incentives / guard rails / internal mechanisms to reward the right things. 
    - So even if people try to defeat the system, the incentives pull them back... 
- Everything is a spectrum... 
    - we will have it all... 
    - so the system needs to be able to grapple with the spectrum...
