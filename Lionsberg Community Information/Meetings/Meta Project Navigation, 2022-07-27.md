# **Episode ? (27 July 2022): Lionsberg | Meta Project Navigation**

Collaborative note taking

## Issues

- Bring in more project management v deeper dive on discernment and community building
    - concerns raised by Judy
    - both play an important role in teams
    - can't be separated out
- shall we do a pull plan?

## Being And Doing
- Ability of each side to manage with equal capacity... 
- Conscious and discerning of both dynamics... 
- Doing/being, inclusion, team vs people showing up in open format; how document
- Value of curating; access to wiki limited so others can't help
- 2 levels; being has emotionality to it; is a source of our words, ignore at our peril, is DNA to everything. Other level - rationality to doing; doing as extension of reactivity, emotionality, vs rationality. If we don't understand how we reacted, what we did as a result, what pattern shows up - vs curating as taking stock of where we are at and seeing flows we are in. If don't notice emotions, lose moment, lose ability to learn. If we feel safe, we can stay in discomfort of emotions, learn. 
- Being - the source of our words... the source of our action... the source of our energy that keeps us interacting... 
- - Rationality - from being - the attempt to make decisions and do things... 
- Jonathan - Compounding the problem of not understanding what arose... what we did because of it... by curating it, we can take stock of where we are at... 
- The emotions in an emergent system... 
- Issue
    - massive amount of info being shared... 
    - Different people in each meeting... 
    - Takes 7 to 12 times maybe to internalize things...
    - Jordan as bottleneck 

## Fishbowl on Being and Doing
- Energy comes from both sides... 
- Being... then in actuation in the tasks that are performed... 
- If we were to do either independent of the other... we would get far less of both #wikigardening... 
- Working plans are critical to getting the actual work done... 
- The Yin Yang of effectiveness... 
- issue: Unprocessed reactions... 
- Emotional reactions we have to a moment as a measuring device... 
- LOOKING AT OUR JOINT REACTIONS TO SOMETHING... 
- DNA level reactions - how do we bring this forward... 
- Two Forms of Trust
    - In action when we make and keep commitments
    - In being when we are related. 
        - Being connected, being safe, being in spaces where we can show up in a safe and well way... 
        - Without safety and ability to be well with ourselves and others... 
        - Judging and feeling judged... 
- The Kinds of Energy
- The Quality of Energy
- The Amount of Energy
    - People tired, yawning, disappearing, or leaning in. 
- The Direction of Energy 
- Anxious, fearful, despairing... 
- vs. high vibing, joyful, I want to be here, and bring everyone else here... 
- We co-create it and can take it higher if we do it in awareness... 
- Observe our own emotionality and that of others - how that affects Energy, ebbs with Energy, flows with Energy... 
- PM Side - is also impacted by energetic bouquet present... 
- Best is if we can witness, manage, be aware of that... then we have best way to take forward whatever the PM is taking forward... 
- For our PM / Rational / Trust from building things... hold that as true AND maintain vigilant energy of where is our energy, how is our energy, where is our contribution to it. 
- Trauma, wounds, showing up in opposition, "But" vs. "And"
- As we are aware of how we are... then whatever we build... is more effective... 
- Our words come from... underlying energy and emotional reactions... 
- Have to integrate the underlying energy... into the emotions.. .into the words that arise... into the action that arises... words and actions following from emotions are like runaway train... 
- Have to return to the underlying energy... 
- Non verbals... body langauge... engagement... leaning in... comments... questioning what we can do next... suggesting things we left out... 
    - If people leaning out - usually the soft side is not working for them. 
    - Usually better to direct questions to whole group.. .
    - "It looks like you are thinking about something"
- Sometimes we lack the language to say - even if we have the opportunity... 
    - the inefficiency of not being able to describe it creates friction
    - The felt sense that the energy is wrong. 
    - The space is missing to lean in and go deep
    - So you run away... which creates space for some to dominant the conversation as others withdraw... 
    - Spend time, be patient, come back to it.

- https://davidburkus.com/2022/07/two-types-of-trust-on-teams/ David Burkus article on two types of trust
- Underneath emotions are needs and they drive us far more than we realize. What do I/we need right now? is an ask that accelerates ability to concisely articulate. "I need to be heard", to be absorbed in a curated sense into what we are being and doing as a community. We are slowly growing that. Encourage to introspect what our needs are and articulate them in preference to "i feel angry, frustrated, energy" - figure out where that energy is coming from as that does us a lot of good.
- self-perception - do i feel part of this group and do i feel heard - subtle complexity - sense of Belonging critical to team. Will have lost a person' s wisdom, critical to group if not engaged.
- Being stuck in what each of us wants vs group; abandoning the group in favor of what I want/need
- leaning into emotions
- Not just the responsability of one person; a shared responsibility of the group
- Felt sense of the energy present - does us and does group a lot of good 
- responsibility of whoever is facilitating to make sure other people are heard AND simultaneous responsibility of people within a group to speak up when something doesn't feel right.
- Thomas Killman Conflict Model 
    - Conflict often emerges when needs are not being met... or there is fear that needs will not be met in the future... 
    - Trying hard to introspect and articulate needs... 
        - Vs. focusing on external anger, frustration... 
        - Where is that energy coming from... 
- Jonathan - needing to be heard, and not just heard but having the important essence I am trying to express curated into the body of what is emerging. 
- The sense of belonging critial to a high performing team
- How do we read the mind of the group? 
    - If we are not paying attention to that - we are likely stuck on what each of us wants. 
- Erik - flip side is the danger of group becoming more important than the individual. 
- Word energy - mostly accepted here-, most have a way to relate to it even if don't hold it exactly as the same. Notion of energy as in chakras, acupuncture, different models; organ in Japan has opposite energy outside/inside
Hard to find agreement between different systems of energy. Yet energy is also the crux for me, but I have no idea what it is. In general sense of energy I agree, in detail we might all disagree or not. I wont join in astrology. 
- How do we determine action is the right action without discernment of really understanding ourselves and others, real being - have seen projects fail because someone wasn't right person in that position. Discernment is key. Also about doing things (Shakespeare) lots of effort by people with no meaning. The more time we spend coming to unity and clarity on purpose, understanding and discernment, the more likely we are to realize the thing that we should do. PM should be asking "What is the best, right thing we ought to do". If someone is afraid to speak up, they might have profound questions about whether project is timely and right project. Maybe they are not in the right place. It is the danger of the Good vs the Best. Less patience with just a lot of activity and more desire to do the One thing, focused better. 
- Saying something is backed by science doesn't create trust. Feeling into sense in the group - this feels great here now... (WM recap: the Vibe as a felt-sense letting each individual know whether to lean in, or take energy and effort to other places.   An aligned vibe increases trust and encourages leaning in.)

- Sensitive people as extraordinary measuring devices of what is present in the room. Bucky Fuller pointed to humans as far more accurate than other measuring devices.
- Feeling a pain of wanting to know where group is going and being overwhelmed by all offers on the table. Leads to curiosity - what are our highest, most important favorite ideas, needs being unmet - something a la taking temperature, creating a heat map of what the group wants/needs/feels/has energy for/resonates towards. 
- Needing to work with people without felt sense of trust, not in same room. Scale is really important. and often you don't get a choice of people you know and who know you. It makes you distrust yourself. Scale really important if you want to do something on planet level.
- Importance of experientially feeling energy in body toward healing or destroying - struggle to understand how that works; for JSu, it is not from a named system but from experience learning from teachers - as clarification of when JSu speaks of energy, this is where he comes from. 
- Two main pieces: facilitating to take everything discussed today and create some output of how we actually inform our activities. Make a list of main activities being done in MP (meetings, working on building tools, etc.) and cross reference learning to the meetings, directory, wiki - to have tangible "how do we apply this to something we are working on". 
- Create context in which those wanting to move forward can efficiently do that honoring what has emerged
- Question: what has worked for MP currently; how create process and system for things to be scheduled so at end of each meeting there is a template of decisions to be made, kept in meeting notes. Vs things being pushed out as no time/place to discuss. Make a when/where to be discussed, even if in a separate meeting. 
- Keep a log of who submitted what for what, for whole group to see how things are flowing, keep visible to all
- RFG for people with questions 
- A place where any issue anyone brings up lives in a sinlge log - allows group to have intelligence to vote on what issues are most pressing, then have teams dedicated to relieve what such issues are
- Shared link to Airtable https://airtable.com/shri1wpG7ceoQQRTA
- A form to enter Issues; from issues, needs are seen
- What's issue, need, RFG - but can start tracking these using the forms set up
- Call issues "stories" vs "issues" - stories of members with good intentions who have a need/something to do
- Main landing page, to keep it on one page - to be able to refer back to a basic setup (WM, JSu, JSa, WL, EW..? are working on it)
- EW would like to facilitate meetings at times
- JSu hope if this grows we will all be facilitating lots of different spaces, each node integrates - so helping people who want to facilitate to find people who gravitate and resonate with them - have millions of them in the world. Facilitation go kit to gather crew, facilitate, help each other. - Adds process for empowering facilitators
- Idea of having others facilitate at times to see how it feels, creates other textures, things coming up, having things more clearly named as we each bring different backgrounds
- In space of being/doing am feeling shift happening in the room and meetings I'm in thats part of the shift towards doing. Feeling it in own work, popping up now as speak about facilitation, practice, feeling the room from different angles of experinece and roles. Things emerging from the group. I'm in inquiry about MP when is right time to allow something to emerge from MP as a group, vs saying I know X that is already in the work so we don't need to reinvent from ground up. But don't want to invite them in if not yet ready. Our way of finding joy, happiness, cocreativity in our own lives, and inside a group (easier when defined as grow relationships and trust). Harder when scaling up. But need to keep asking where do we want to go and so need to answer at what point bring in these large pieces that could squash what is happening here but could also facilitate and upshift us to the next level. Just voicing the question into the room.
- Depends a lot on facilitation styles - intrusion of facilitation into the process questions. May need to flip between styles and become very flexible, aware of which styles to use when. Say Yes, do No example. 
- We are talking about many things others have spent lifetimes working on. Answers are there. Resonate with not reinventing the wheel and aggregating the work and resources together. Program Management - you don't have to do a lot, just find highly talented people and coordinate resources and empower them. 
- Powerful question: Do you know anyone who does well what you are talking about needing to do well?
- How incorporate what comes from notes on Being/Doing into our (process, tools, systems). 
- Might be easy to incorporate based on basic forms and logs. Translate issues/needs/stories and combine with process of group sourcing, aggregate, tie to accessible platform to serve every sovereign seeking to emerge and move
- JSa Offers to talk about technologies that don't exist that all sovereigns could use
- JSu Practice: where would this go? Issue - technologies don't exist - to issue log? Evaluate when right time to discuss is? Put time and resources then.
- VA, JSa work with JSu this week on setting up some PM backbone items to present to group next week. 
- Makes every significant decision transparent to the group!
- Wrap:
- 
- Level of participation, wisdom shared
- A lot of I and We. We is hard, not built into us in our culture. As we look at ourselves as a community we begin to see our effect as individuals collected together. The amount of that today was really exciting to me. 
- Appreciated MW comment in the chat - "here's what's most alive; this is what I need".. When I read it, it helped me make a shift from "what am I to do here". Felt like the right day to say how do I discern and say, is this the right time to bring this piece in. Doing as outpouring of framing I come from into the conversation. and compulsion to act. Challenge of MP - there are many things I could be doing today - Of those 50, I actually want to be doing 30, of those 30, which is the most in service right now? becomes the question in everr moment, meeting. 
- Capturing "these are doings that are coming out of this meeting" - keep asking, do we still feel this piece is alive, is it building momentum or is it dissolving, roadblocks, not having needed pieces.
- If we had a clearer understanding of how valuable something is to others, it would allow more things to be done in parallel. Created a template because it was useful to someone - it being useful helped it get created by one creating it. So also need some level of commitment on the part of the one using it. Having firm decisions and commitment on doing an experiment creates space for people to put energy in and do a thing well, because it is going to be used. 
- how do we actually create the back pressure that shows us what we bring forward is valuable and so it is responded to. Struggle to discern.
- How to solve the issue of the void vs knowing clearly what is valuable to have/do
- If we can share our needs, we discover where our services will be of value. Find out what people want and need. It leads to us bottling up what is needed. We can discern the lowest hanging fruit, lean approach to what are we doing first. - Internal and external needs. Share needs, get resources from and through group. As we look at serving one another in practical way, we become aware of external needs. Emotions engage - I care they succeed, I know they have a need.
- Vision that world runs on marketing and advertising creating needs we don't need and ignoring needs we don't see. What if there was a gigantic needs database - if world needs X, I can create it. 
- Majority of needs are common, very few are individual. If we could develop a listening engine that could be very powerful.
- Tokens to vote with as a way to flush out what's most important. Put together with listening engine, have pragmatic plans to see those things acted on.
- In 2 or 3 works, can VA cohost a workshop on Offers and Needs - provide resources to do 2hr matchmaking session on zoom with group of 20-30 people. At end of event, all needs were posted on event page and showed up in group's directory until expiry. Became input method to express needs, facilitated in community with others and sharing, afterwards capturing. if not solved during session, lives on. Low tech way to get started. 
- Use this to invite new people from other groups for start of next cycle, get list of needs, problems, and report back with what resources we have. 2-3 weeks from today. JSu commits that if VA hosts, we will do it. 
- We are doing things in new ways and doing new things, and we are swimming in new value being created and noticed. 
- JSu to talk to KS more about this
- Pain button; include a song that relates to the suffering
- Outer edges of our ability to articulate in edge experiences, emergent and drowning
- JSu: Stacey speaking for a lot of suffering people around the world and for whom it is not self evident who to turn to, how to get help - we can do better. 
 
*Tangents/Things not yet discussed:
- how do the external systems of the world (climate feedback loops) impact our balance between doing/being - ex) are we acting this way because we are in an ACTUAL crises or a manufactured crises (when your boss creates a crises to get someone to work faster when it's not actually a crises)?
- what happens when there's a group of 10 people and 1 person who missed a previous meeting has a burning concern that was addressed last time for an hour? do we spend time going into it again, asking to watch the recording? How to balance the need to move forward when people can't be at every meeting? 
- Alignment has to come out of the beingness together, feeling "this is the next emergent thing". Identifying it, like with faciliation so there can be both being and doing; from there follows bringing in people trained to do this. Only saying it because it emerges at that moment as a result of (...)
- 
- LANGUAGE / LEXICON
    - How we introduce people to words they might be triggered by
    - Developing New Lanaguage intentionally. 
- Energy - crazy world... and yet absolutely the crux... and yet we don't know how to relate to it... 
- The big tension out there... spirituality and energy.. and the difficulty verifying or measuring... 
- Constructive theory - The physics of information... 
    - Where difference is... is where information is... 
    - Information having mass - mass / energy equivalence... 
    - The little things that move disposition of a system... 
    - Lots of differences between people - creates the predisposition or "mass" for a system to move in a particular way. 
    - Through experiments you can collapse or open up the System to more difference... 
    - As it becomes more integrated, becomes more stable... 
    - Mapping from a physics level.. 
    - A lot of cultural different understanding of how energy exchanges in systems... 
- being
    - Knowing our selves
    - Knowing others
    - Is tapping into the engine of motivation. 
- How do we determine an action is the right action... if we don't ahve the discernment that comes out of really understanding one another... 
    - Projects failing due to blind trust in people that are not the right people, or don't see the whole picture... 
    - Time spent coming to clarity of purpose, understanding, discernment... 
    - What is the Best thing? 
    - What is the Right thing? 
    - The profound question to determine if the project is the right one, or timely. 
    - The danger of the Good vs. the Best... 
    - The danger of activity... 

- learn from failure - experiments and learning fast.
- We have to come back to what is happening
- Trust exists on so many levels
    - The sense of what is going on
    - The sense of what is aligned and what is not aligned. 

- Ability to "be" depends upon distributing the "work" and would be positively impacted by increasing the --> Ability to self organize, which depends upon --> way to submit proposals / way to contact other people / way to create sub-groups /ability to understand what's happening --> these all require doing in order to create systems such as a directory, proposal system, shared calendar --> which require doing and iteration on how these actions impacted others and made them feel.
- Who among us are the canaries in the coal mine
    - What are the highest
    - Temperature or heat map - of what the group wants, needs, feels, has energy for, resonates for... 
    - Heat map of what is present... 
- The Game is the infinite game - privilege be in a small group 
- AND - we need to do that across lots of people we will never meet... 
- Lots of individuals rooms with people have the felt sense of trust... 
- Do we need to feel 100% comfortable in the main room or in a sub-room? Constant tension between the scale and how this impacts how hard it will be to either do or be in a group. is there a change in the ideal ratio at scale?
    - number people | doing | being
    - 100 people | 80% | 20%
    - 10 people | 75% | 25%
    - 3 people | 50% | 50%

- How do we take what was discussed today, and create output that would inform our activities. 

Hypotheses: 
- process / system for getting things scheduled to be resolved... 
- End of each meeting
    - Decisions to be made
    - Questions to be answered
    - Logs... 
    - Issue Logs... 
- Requests For Guidance
    - Form
    - Log
- Issues Log
    - An issue is the first step... 
    - From the issues - the needs are created... (or stories)... 
- Needs Log
    - I was trying to do X, Y happened... if too abstract, the need can't be met... what is the minimum viable condition of satisfaction
    - the right level of granular data... 
    - the next part needed for needs is introducing and presenting dependencies and ontologies so searching and triaging is easy
- Landing Page... 
- Lots of Facilitators... 
- Process for Empowering Facilitators... 
- Wendy M - I am feeling a shift towards doing... in various rooms... it is happening already... and popping up right now, faciliation, practice, lead, feel the room from different angles, experiences, roles... 
- Activities -- who else is doing this activity better than us?
- Feeling towards how critical scale is... 
- at what point do we bring in large pieces that could squash... but also faciliate and support... 
- Care that facilitation can impose a direction and or a decision which the group, if given another facilitation style - would not have taken


Activities X Certain Balance
- Ex) Weekly Meetings x being and doing
    - what is an idea for a way to solve this 
    - what is an example of another org/group that does this best?
        - does anyone know them to contact them?
    - if no to the above question, is this something we need to create ourselves?
- Ex) Shared calendars
    - what group does this best?
    - does anyone know them to contact them?
    - is this something we need to create ourselves?
- Is there something avaialbe within one or two degrees... 
    - If not, what is the minimum viable way to invent... 

- 

Activities: (What are activities you want to be involved with?)

* Strategy, and how to tie resourcing to what is emerging...

* Digesting, discerning what is seeking to emerge and what is present but not yet spoken or needs to be spoken; moving anything forward that touches on the feel of community in ways that brings up the highest potential in participants for the highest good in the world

* meta game, landing page, needs tracker, read the mind of the group (curation),

* Creating an awesome member directory

* Resource Development, For-profit entity transition to steward ownership, building support systems

* I'd like to help with process and program

* Claryfying: governance models - concepts of complexity, collaboration and knowledge management platforms - scaling strategies

* Becoming more literate as a community on how to work in complexity

* Welcoming; checking up on people, leading philosophical discussions, consulting with personal development goals

* assisting to build clarity in energy exchange
* supporting written clarity of universal values
* digesting and reflecting

* Creating a map that helps each person in Meta Project a way to see how their piece fits into the larger whole

* Putting our receptors out to others orgs/actors in a way that recognizes and records them—and hopefully involves them

* Focusing on disagreement to understand where we are - sitting in the fire / being and tension

Ideas: a session to go through the orgs and have people vouch for them.

## Retro
- The pracitcal second half was "held" by the first conversation... 
- Enjoyed the practical second space which was held and informed by the first half... 
- The level of participation, wisdom, and community shared
- Starting to look at ourselves as a community, and seeing our affect as individuals collected together... 
- What is it that I need right now to be and do better in service? 
    - My current need re. Lionsberg is to DO and would love to work with a couple of people to move forward with an action/project. I have embraced you all as respected colleagues and don't have an immediate need to get to know you all deeply at this point in time. I expect that will happen over time as we do this work. Our work at Planetary CARE is very important and clear. I would like to also contribute to the Meta Project. I would like to know how I can best contribute - working with a group.
- When is the right time to bring right pieces 
- Which of the 30 things I could do 
- In traditional model 
    - priorities picked by peole in leadership, priorities communicated. 
    - In this space - we also want to allow emergence to pick the priority... 
    - GRAB THREADS OF DOINGS ARISING FROM EACH MEETING... 
    - Regalvanize, Remind, is it still alive? is it building momentum? should we continue it... what does that feel like and look like for me... 
    - If we had a clearer understanding of how valuable something might be if I do it...  could allow more things to be done... 
    - Some level of commitment - if I spend time on a project - I want to know someone is going to use it or it is a waste of time
        - Firm commitments to experiments - that will be integrated and used... 
- Solve do we solve that issue of the VOID? 
- BILL - if we can share our needs
    - We can discover where services wil be of value. 
        - In startups - charge a few dollars... gets to a yes / no
    - Low hanging fruit... 
    - Differentiation of internal and external needs... 
    - Then combine together to meet huge external needs... 
    - Based on capacity and needs met internally... 
- Vincent - 
    - Token based voting towards activity they still want done... 
- Jonathan 
    - The world runs on marketing and advertising now. which creates needs we don't have... 
    - What is world had gigantic needs database... 
- Then decision matrix
    - Sorting things by priority
    - Low hanging fruit 
- This that emerge are at the inarticulate edge... 
    - have to try... 
    - we are doing something powerful... which is being different and using different filters... 
    - The value of that difference is that there is a lot of low hanging fruit... 
    - Like a different pair of glasses, and wherever you look you see something different. 
    - HYPER AWARE OF THIS
    - The lens of seeing new value... what is possible... how we show up... 
    - Jordan things this relates to his writing on Perception... 
    - Be hyper aware of this... 
- People in need often cannot express them... 
- I feel so overlooked... 
- Pain Button 
    - usually there is a song that illustrates how they are feeling... 
    - Poems... 
    - As archytpical mind maps... that can help us gauge the space someone (people? Organizations? Teams? communities? nations?) are in. 
    - Wendy E has been talking about the physics of data... stories and differences... as information... that has mass / energy equivalence... 
    - It may be that songs and poems that people resonate and share are a story that reflects something real... that although it is maybe still inarticulate, is a window into the sould and reality someone is experiencing... 
    - And it may be that each individual is a window into consciousness on some more general level. 
    - So by hearing from those brave enough to speak up, we can understand that they are speaking a pain or need that is common to many.
