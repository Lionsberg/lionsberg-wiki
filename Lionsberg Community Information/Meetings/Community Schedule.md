# Community Schedule
We are working to grow and [[Become]] [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

July 2022 Update: 

Our next stage requires that begin to coordinate and align our resources, plans, and goals. 

To make this easier, we are going to test out a new [[Battle Rhythm]] to create a [[Pulse]] for the emerging Community. 

## Asynchronous Communications
The vast majority of the work and relationship in the community is created asychronously and in small teams and groups. 

To stay connected, please engage in at least one small team or group that you are passionate about. See [[Forging Or Joining A Team]] and [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]]. 

## Attendance 
Everyone is welcome to be in Community in whatever ways they are most comfortable. Engage as much as you would like, and don't overwhelm yourself. 

Meetings will be broadcast and can be watched live by anyone with an internet connection. Meetings can be joined "live" by those who have agreed to the [[Provisional Community Agreement]].  

## Dinner Party Standards
Until we establish a better standard, we are going to treat our official gatherings as if they were something like a dinner party. Everyone is expected to follow the spirit of the [[Provisional Code]] and the host reserves the right to ask anyone to leave.
