## Hypothesis

## Layering of Levels of Abstraction 
- Highest abstraction 
- Mid Level
- What actions can we take today... 
    - Possible - Patron or Patron like... 
    - Not expected to raise a lot - and help certain things lubricated... 
    - Principle - individuals have a mechanism to create... 
    - Value creation and presentation in advance... 
- Hypothesis: 
    - Leader: Jonathan steps up to help lead... Work with Bill 
    - White Paper: Within a week first drapped up talked about LB Meta project container... 
    -  Co-Budget - is a platform that might be able to help... 

## 11 Minute Retro... 
- Leave time; reminder to do this (Forrist, Killu)
- It was productive and a diversion... Propose and Agree on Topics in advance... 
    - And have a mechanism to check that against what is alive in the moment... 
- Balancing immediate needs / with the high level work that is needed... 
- Is there any paramount objection to advancing with what came up... 
- Naming clearly what we are doing... so that people can fund... may be a super core idea... 
- 

## Safety Net of Survival Mode...
- Transparency - there is no pot of money to be shared out right now, even as there is need and desire to be supported, and commitment to create workable teams that can be funded towards worthy goals.
- Teams of 3 express what they think they can do towards goals, present out to community to be resourced if community finds value in it.
- Jordan offers to spend an hour with Jonathan
- We aggregate highest value items from the list of many and advance them towards funding, articulating what is valuable and why. 
- Idea of collaborative funding that can be set up fast - not a lot of money, but can be raised rapidly, to lubricate projects/needs moving forward. Patreon for Lionsberg.
- Parking lot epiphany - nonprofit like Lionsberg backs individuals doing projects; contributions to nonprofits tax-deducible to donors. Needs solid reporting and legal oversight.
- Patreon can be done today, vs needing to set it up.
- Abuse of the system potential if individual is set up to be supported by nonprofit.
- Proposal - Jonathan takes lead on focus area of funding acute needs for him and beyond (or he finds someone to own the process), make a decision - Patreon is good enough, or some other next step - say within a week have a first draft saying "this is fundraising for MP container", leader reaches out as needed to move it forward, get content, support from community etc. Setting deadline gets it moving and done.
- Someone may need Jonathan's skills in the MP community so if he were to post statement of services/capabilities, someone might pay for a project.

## Action Items
- Forrist will reach out to Spirit and Vincent to feed in his research on impact investment
- Vicent and Spirit are working on processing multiple databases of funding sources, and will present those back out to the community... 
- Jordan, Jonathan will connect to discuss acute cash needs, and how to meet those in sustainable fashion
- Forrist will give Jonathan a hr of coaching on Co-Budget / Patron etc. 
- Jonathan will lead the project or find someone to own the progress - to create a generic infrastructure that other people also will eventually benefit from. Will circulate for input, make sure is legally whole and compliance is taken care of.
- WL can help legally
- Jonathan Bill Judy Erik Michael Forrist develop hypothesis for acute funding, Jordan to be included in high level review. Include teams of at least 3. Teams define their purpose, principles, goals, and way those goals advance are in a shared mission to design and build a better world. Build this towards a system of teams developing proposals, getting funded, presenting created value to funders (so need to develop a mechanism of integrating results into the community, being publicly accountable for transparent accounting of funds). Open Collective or Open Impact to raise funds, Co-Budget used to allocate money after money is raised.
- For next meeting: stick with agenda that is created from topics that arose during the week. And, to still find ways to honor what arises in the moment in the group (not to only stick to agenda but check in what is most alive)
- Let's look at the branding and marketing function as a way to help both the whole and each team articulate and fund... 
- Michael - how to aggregate and elevate 
- Circle Weaver - based on sociocracy.. .PC Uses it to manage meetings... 
- patreon - similar of crowd 'gifting'
open collection - totally transparent finances largely used by geo local groups - can add lots of projects and project specific funding - like patreon can have anon funders
cobudget -  allocate funds in a group processWe 

Jordan's update: in the network a growing frustration and desire to better aggregate funds. Future Capital as potential collaboration partner. As we have numerous teams proposing work against global goals, we can see and sort among them.

Retro:
- Stick to agenda but also honor what arises that is alive. 
- Ask in the meeting what is alive, prepare agenda based on what is on agenda from before and arose during the week. Notice that both what arises, and the agenda, are alive in the group. How to make decisions? Maybe invite group consent to make the decisions in the moment.
- Look at how people are treated in the system, not just at the resourcing - to reach the higher good
- Not to underestimate being able to name clearly what we are doing that people are willing to give money for. Figure out what is most pressing on each of us, be able to clearly articulate it, and get it to fundable level of articulation. (Open Impact key aspect - get teams able to clearly articulate to become fundable)
- Patreon - can use iteratively, can gradually grow, vs something supporting one campaign at a time; is more product oriented.
- Jordan having high level discussions on organizing money on larger scales
- In the next week+, get more clarity on what arose today in concrete
- Focus on how to clearly articulate - perhaps a marketing function that helps sustain itself this way helping other teams get funded. Team helps people speak and access resources, is funded as others get funded. (Michael, Wendy, Jordan, others?) Helps not just LB MP speak, but also helps each team speak. 
- Establish a funding stream to aggregate organizations needs extra time and maybe a team
- Next few sessions let's do 90 minutes
- Add 30 minute invite on calendar to the 60 minute existing one
- Suggestion to have a time keeper
