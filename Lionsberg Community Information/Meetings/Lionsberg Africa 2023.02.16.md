- Team formed a new Kenya WhatsApp ground to review the content Jordan has been providing. Hooray!

## Wisdom and Love
- without partiality... 
- All created in God's image 
- All share in the same desires. to be loved. to be shown kindness. to be shown mercy. 
- All shared in same pain and suffering... 
- not esteeming one person better than another... 
- looking at one another with same eyes as God... 

## From Two Weeks Ago 
- The idea of an **Ecosystem** that has **EVERYTHING** needed for **flourishing and abundant life**. 
    - If something is lacking - fill it up 
        - 
    - If something is present that doesn't belong - remove it 
        - 
- The idea of replicable patterns - Pattern Language
- Mapping / illuminating the functions of the (BODY / ECOSYSTEM)
- The question for each function is not HOW - but WHO - **Who Not How** 
    - we all do our own parts, but in the end, on our own, we find out that we are not actually healing, lifting up, and empowering the community... 
    - Struggling in isolation... struggling with how... vs. looking out - to Who... 
- What people or organizations are called to the complete functioning body / ecosystem that is lacking in nothing?
    - 
- Deep listening and understanding... so that we can properly diagnose and intervene very carefully in the complex adaptive system of systems 
    - Patterns... 
        - the common problems
        - the common needs 
    - Pattern Language - https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_system_design/the_way/concepts_and_ideas/pattern_language 
- This will help us see the opportunities / gaps / needs -
    - each part of the body needs all other parts of the body 
- in order to begin creating a complete ecosystem - a complete house... A dwelling place suitable for consciousness to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony.

## The Creation of a Hub / Platform... 


## Reflections
- Such a stretch in thinking, it might feel impossible... 
- But it is possible... 
- Stretching on thinking how isolated - even on how governments approach things... 
    - Patchwork... based on loyalty, driven by politics... 
    - Vs. needs and solutions based... 
    - no equity of development... develops equity... 
    - many communities feel disgruntled - feel isolated 
- Empowering communities to take charge of their own develoment... 
    - electoral process so competitive... 
    - because of competition for resource allocation based on who gains power... 
    - Equal opportunity... 
- Flourishing Ecosystem... 
    - when God gave us different gifts and talents... 
    - the purpose was a world lacking nothing... 
    - Requires people that are selfless... 
    - How can I be a blessing outward to the community... 
    - A movement looking and seeing and solving problems for the community... 
- Basic Human Role: Gathering Information, Making Sense of It, and Solving Problems for the community / nature / one another, etc...

## Closing Reflections 
- Great meeting. Pattern Language approach around common problems, needs, solutions... continuous improvement... 
- Even failure is a form of learning... 
    - learning how to not do it again... 
- We need to be the Who... 
- Homework - think deeply about hwo we can start somewhere, be impact, create the system that can be replicated... improving governance... thinking not in scarcity but in the thinking of God, the thinking of abundance... 
- Excited because this system will cause inclusivity... cut across different cultures... actual be able to tap into the strength from different cultures, bring together communities... 
- Rewarding, stretching minds, thinking beyond the small ways we have thought in the past... 
- All things are possible to them that believe... 
- We are not competing, but sharing the wisdom and knowledge that God has given us... 
- Not competitive, but complimentary with each other... made to be a solution in part with every other person... 
- Understanding in a holistic manner what we need and who we are... Each of us is who we are because that is God created me to me... 

## Next Week
- Finish up the "map" of problems, needs, and aspirations 
	- What is lacking? Fill it up 
	- What does not belong? Remove it 
- See if we can populate each "function" of the body / ecosystem with three individuals we know and trust are called by God to that area or function. 
- Identify any gaps, and come up with a plan to expand the network to fill the gaps. 

## After That 
- Those starting 3 in each area will then be able to map the people and the organizations they know and trust in the space. 
- This will allow a shared map of the body / ecosystem to emerge by function 
	- Make the invisible visible

## After That 
- We will create a series of functional teams... 
	- Wisdom and Strategy for the Whole 
	- Program Management / Mission Control 
	- Operations 
	- Impact / Demonstrations 
	- Resourcing / Funding 
	- Groundswell / Movement Building
