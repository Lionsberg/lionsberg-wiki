## Topics

- publishing books and copyright / commons etc 
    - Pete has drafted publishing work flow
    - Tool that makes great websites... callout boxes... internal linking
    - Online Book, table of contents on side... 
    - Ability to push to nice PDF... 
    - Not too far to make a nice Kindle book 
    - Websites / blogs / books are similar.. 
    - CMS that handles pages / source code
    - Then thing that takes source code, processes it, spits out website / PDF / Kindle... 
    - Built into Massive Wiki
    - Hypothesis - set up internal publishing co - that can assign ISBN etc... 
    - and customized agreements that can waterfall earnings between author and system
    - stuff published on ibooks, kindle, and print on demand (easy on Demand with Amazon) - and PDF, and Web and Wiki... and all those are same backend... 
    - Then - if you want distribution - sales and marketing... 
    - Translation - 
        - Outermost shell of a process... 
        - Instead of writing a book in english, that turns into another language... we want to think of there is multiple language communiities - some people are bridge builders between communities, so we should not farm out translation - but have the communities in different langauges building a parallel set of books that mirror, echo, and inform the english one, growing up together, saying similar things, and all learning from one another.. 
        - Not paying... but someone who truly gets it... working in parallel, interlocking, cross referencing correcting, and growing up together... 
        - Wikipedia kind of does this. 
    - How do we help our siblings who mostly speak other langauges have similar rich library, and how do all sides learn from each other. 
    - Wikipedia in as many languages as possible
        - Half the room - what we do is take all wikipedias there are, translate all those into English... then hit button to translate back out to as many as we can... 
        - Other half - you are taking knowledge of the world into American english then back out... a bunch of vibrant communities - if there is not an article froom Swahili on X... doesn't mean you want to translate into Swahili - have them look at world through their own unique lens and culture, read in other languages, talk to elder... and write from that perspective.. of the people who are going to read it... 
        - Fitting to story / context / lens 
        - culutre, way we think about core things is different... you really want the CONCEPT not to be a word for word translation of another culture - but find the thing it is pointing at, and place it in the native context... 
        - And if you do it right, you learn so much.
        - People writing journals in different languages... cross reading and correctly.. if you do it right, both cultures learn and grow and get more cohesive... 
        - Individual and local cross reference and enrichment...
        - Lesson from Team of Teams on essential of cross-embedding agents so that someone on a team knows someone else on the other team, and can vouch that they are human and decent...

        - William Calvin's "how brains work" stuff
        - Howard Bloom's "Global Brain"
- proposal from Wendy E and Pete

- Communicating into the void
    - a challenge of asynchronous, not-in-person communication
    - [Warnock's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock%27s_dilemma)
    - In old days - never so much info flowing that you wouldn't have a response... with so much info... If you didn't hear anything back...
    - The stories we tell ourselves about that... 
    - Possible solution - 
        - Bias towards advancing... 
        - Work on things you believe in even absent the rest of the flock
        - you know you delivered something useful... 
        - You want feedback, but you don't need it from other pods in the flotilla - keep going unless strong signal you are wrong... 
        - To answer need - a lot of internal communication in your local system that we are on the right track... 
        - Agency issue...
        - Local vs. global issue... 
        - Points to the need for strong core / small groups that are committed.. 
        - small autonomous groups - same message... 
- Leaders
    - Failure mode 1: Leaders fail to lead as braodly as they can
        - I know the right answer, won't be assertive enough because I don't want to assume my answer is right
            - Highly sensitive
            - Don't want to experience hurt / rejection
            - Shy / don't speak up
            - Why don't we speak up and lead
            - Worry about what other people will think or feel

## "Intellectual Property" Licenses

- Hypothesis - wikipedia articles have a specific CCASA license, and they switched to it. 
- Concern - I am putting a ton of material into wiki... and it needs the right license.
- Example - Cory Efram - multi-expert... his books
    - you can buy
    - you can download without DRM
    - Also creative commons non commercial sharealike 

- Wikipedia - CC-BY-SA
- Cory Doctorow's "Little Brother" - CC-BY-NC-SA

- Copyright. All Rights Reserved. (Proprietary)
- CC0 (Public domain)
- CC-BY

- BY = attribution - have to give credit to whoever made it... 
    - "the author" is a weird concept in Wiki
- NC = non-commercial
- SA = sharealike
    - I am going to give this to you, you can give it to others, but if you modify it have to have the same license... 
    - if you do a remix - you can give it away, but have to have same restrictions on mine... can't remix and make commercial. 
- ND = no derivatives

- Creative commons was a lot of work, and some of the smartest kindest deepest hearted people in the world. Smart, ethical, high power people. People who built creative commons a lot how to do it, how to fit in, protecting rights they carved out... and fortified it over time through multiple slow fine grained iterations.. huge amount of work to build the right infrastructure for this.. 
- Now - don't know who they are... 
- In much of developed word - you can't give something away to public domain - takes very specific legally correct way to give things away. 

- Pete's experience - every time you put an extra restriction... limits how far it is going to go... each of qualities is like a sieve... the more you put, the harder to distribute... 

- If we want our work to spread as broadly as possible, all conditions add friction of forward motion of your stuff into the world. 

- Public domain - no restriction, belongs to the commons - really giving it away.

- with wikipedia, enough material there - big glob of stuff people can steal and do bad stuff - being super easy to take a copy of all text on wikipedia, put advertising on it, make spam websites people fall into and cant get out... 

- download all wikipedia, and give away to people without internet access... 

- licenses don't stop people from doing things - gives you right to sue them. 

- People do bad things with content. pick it up. use for spam. also really easy to just change a word, weaponize things, exploit things... also not hard to weaponize in various ways... 

- someone wants to make money, download chunk of whatever, put a more restrive license on it, then sue originator. 

- Happens with patents etc. - steal out of commons, enclose it, then sue originators... if they set up venture to have enough money to have legal team to enforce, can squash little people one by one who don't have enough money to fight... 

- Defenses - 
    - go to EFF or ACLU - let them know you are getting bullied, like ACLU will swing into action. 
    - Based on recognizance... Google etc. helps protect and do spam blocking... easy to put a big moat around wikipedia... not so easy when you're small... 

- Failure mode concern - think about the people who think it sounds interesting - I see it is CC X - why should I go buy it if I can get it for free? 
    - Answer - we don't care - read it, distribute it... 

- Next - how to protect from bad actors
    - Share alike, non commercial? 
    - For some SA and NC too restrictive... if you have a book in wiki, and we need to split references... 
    - An answer is to split wiki into two parts NC CA ...  
    - And relating to editorial control... with two wikis - two cultures... 
    - You may want certain books in a certain circle, then community wiki with much less restrictive more emergent...
    - 

- Hypothesis: 

## Forking the Meeting Into Being and Doing
- It will be more work. 
- Issue - the idea of an architecture team... 
    - in sovereign pods of 5 to 10 people, you want them to be
        - 1. self sufficient
            - From agile, software dev, etc. - drive down authority to smaller and smaller teams. 
            - and let's make the designated person in authority to make the choice for the whole company... authority of company desolved into individual people... 
            - those people with decision authority have to be single threaded - responsibility for 1 thing and damned good at it, whole day and night sleep thinking about that, and when they decide will decide right... 
            - Team of 8 people - has all the capabilities in it - have all capabilities - can do architecture, dev, QA, etc... 
            - teams of 8 people, that trust each other well, who can do whole thing - Master Builder teams... And only have Master Builder teams... 
            - What happens - is that in a day, we have to do x... and everyone has to do all the hard work...so that everyone is an expert on the whole system... because its a Master Builder team, everyone responsible for whole system... opportunity to feed the learning of the Whole System... 
    - Our teams all need to be Master Builder teams, who make architectural decisions as well as all otehr kinds of decisions... 
    - And you have Master Builder teams who know how to build sever plans and nuclear power plants, and dont allocate them without training and certs... 
    - and every team can do every part of the plant...
    - Some rule at differnet levels of complexity... 
    - SEAL TEAMS - same theory... 
    - If small teams are grappling with complexity and might get separated - you need self-sufficient teams... 
    - And enough cross training and cross embedding - so that when teams get separated, can predict and move.. 
    - THE REPLACEMENT FOR ARCHITECT'S INTENT IS COMMANDER'S INTENT / PRODUCT INTENT. AND THE SYSTEMS PULSE... 
    - VISION STEWARD...
