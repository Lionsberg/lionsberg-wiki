## Lionsberg and Meta Project
- In need of reset... 
- We have a good group of people here... 
    - Let's take that and call it something... 
    - Not meta project...
-  Focus on Lionsberg... 
    -  quick iterative sprints to build and improve... 
    -  Jordan out inspiring and bringing people to a network of doers and achievers... 
    -  Be really careful about - participating in that network of doers and achievers, but not be the center of it... 
    -  Let's have a relationship with Jordan and Lionsberg... 
    -  Some group... the Meta Project group - is a network of people I can bring things to... 
    -  That group says
        -  here is the things we can do for the people you have found
        -  here is the things we can't do... and where the gaps are... 
-  Lionsberg needs to have a set of capabilities... 
-  and a group of groups... 
-  "I am a group, part of many other groups... and Lionsberg is one of the entities that helps me".
-  8 billion citizenships 
    -  invitation... 
    -  make it as powerful adn as good as we can
    -  continuoulsy improve it.. 
-  Humanity is in the situation we are in because of something very similar to value creation and scale... 
    -   Need to make a design decision here... 
-   Some cultures did not end up with hierarchies and dominance structures... 
    -   Dawn of Everything - authorsr don't give an answer
    -   why was there a massive civiliation that didn't have hierarchy.. 
    -   there were a few examples of ways the culture set up things... 
        -   part is that the culture didn't believe in power hierarchies... 
        -   Western story is that erudite knowledgeable studied european... western... philosophers... came over and "civilized the savages"... civilized the ones who could... the others were evicted, put on reservations,e tc...
    -   maybe history is opposite that in many ways... 
        -   europeans were warring, fighting... 
        -   many tribes had sophisticated knowledge about how to organize society across time
        -   europeans took many of those ideas and incorporated into a "less bad" system informed by indigenous wisdom... 
        -   then evicted and killed them... 
    -   Why are there people starving on the street? 
        -   if they are part of your society they get fed... 
        -   There were cultures that cared about humanity in a different way that European philosophy...
    -   Places that made it happen... 
        -   Every few years upside down ceremony where leaders torn down and made fun of, the lower lifted up... 
        -   Others - including North American culture... set up so that men roughly in charge of executive function / hunting / defense... 
        -   women were responsible for actually gathering and making decisions... the council of grandmothers that actually called the shots and had authority over the society... 
-  so as a technologist... 
    -  there is a way to set up the conditions and the machinery... 
    -  DAOs too mechanistic...
    -  but set up voting etc. so that the right thign happens... 
    -  most people don't work that way, and it won't work over time... 
    -  If we add in lots of different kinds of people... not everyone talks in rational discussion... get different power things... 
    -  so at the scale of humanity... you end up with a kind of society that isn't obvious yet - but is more about the way humans work together... 
    -  recognizing that some people have domination mindset... some are looking out for the whole group... 
    -  and to figure out how to wisely mix and tilt balance scales of those powers... in a way you would need if all 8 billlion were invited in... 
-  Third - 
    -  go for diversity... 
    -  some groups have university style debate and decision making.. 
    -  other societies have a respected wise leader who listens, presents back... 
    -  and a bunch of other ways people manage themselves... 
-  A mistake we don't want to make - 
    -  is selectvely shoot every decision making power group in the head - unless it the one that works like the majority power structure... 
    -  if you are anything different than a corporation with a bastard head and greedy shareholders... society shoots you in the head... 
    -  What we want is a diverse array of groups learning from each other
    -  however you want to govern your self is the right way to govern yourself... unless you are a bastard CEO with greedy shareholders... 
-  move towards less bad, and towards more good
- beckoning higher... presenting various models... setting forth principles / values / ideals... and encouraging / inviting / empowering a diverse group of groups to rise to ways of being that are more "good"...
    - meaning make it possible for us to enjoy the future we all want... 
    - greater levels of the things we say we value... like 
        - safety nets
        - community
        - infrastructure
        - ladders towards potentials
        - helping one another
        - making wise right decisions 
        - etc. etc.


## Superbrain
- [[Insular Cortex]] / [[Insula]] 
- Takes in signals from the body... makes sense / mediates for conscious awareness is not swamped / overwhelmed... 
- and then mediates the "dialogue" between consciousness and the body - 
    - so that the present state of embodiment can be take into account... 
    - along with the external conditions... 
    - in generating plans / possible patterns of action that could be undertaken next... 
- If we could establish an Insula in Lionsberg - that could take in information from 20 or 100 groups... 
    - And take that into account... 
    - and present back out... possible futures / courses of action / etc. that could be undertaken... 
    - Via a system of communication and invitation / not control... 
        - Something like the Request For Guidance process we hypothesized earlier... 
        - a two way system of signaling and exchanging information and awareness in response to threats / opportunities / needs / issues etc. internally or externally... 
- The Wiki is kind of like memory that can store things that can later be accessed.. (Is that the hippocampus that is the store of a vast array of potentials, patterns, sets of rules, experiences, wisdom... etc.)? 
- There is Conscious Awareness... 
    - That receives information from the Insula about current embodied state... 
    - and can access the total array of information / patterns / wisdom stored in the (hippocampus?)...
    - To generate potential futures / patterns of action / plans etc... 
- So the next stage of emergence of a supermind... 
    - Might be: now that we have a minimum viable memory storage space... 
    - Set up a minimum viable Insula function... 
        - That would take in signals from the various parts of the body (for now - various groups in the group of groups)
        - pass that on to Consciousness... 
    - And then a basic signaling mechanism for Consciousness to pass information and potentials back to the body (distributed network of parts functioning without conscious awareness being aware of them at all times... subconsciously...)
- Powerful and Limited Metaphor check from Pete 
    - 1. we don't really know how the Insula works... 
        - there are black boxes... we kind of think we know what they do... but we don't know how... 
    - 2. For 25 years Pete has been tracking / thinking / experimenting - fractal self similarity... 
        - doown to the level of brain structures
        - and up to the level of societies
        - the way people work togehter is largely because of the way their brains work
        - a dozen people around a meeting table - interacting partly because of how their brain works
        - a dozen meeting rooms interacting together in approximatley the way the brain works
        - but theer is a big difference in that there is a human to human or society thing that I don't think happens in brain structures... 
        - when we are most effectivley being human, it is because there is a complicated system inside each persons heads... and that system is with another level of human interaction with ... all the social elmeents of being a social animal... which are differnet than being a human brain... 
        - so you want to make sure not to mechanize your society down to the level of brain... 
        - and take advantage of the SOCIALITY THAT HAPPENS... 
    - Maybe many experiments fail because those two elements are divorced from one another - and inseprable... 
    - There is a social and cultural way of being togehter that would be required for the technical support system to function properly... 
    - Partly - enacting social processes... is a super power that we have... 
    - so it is one of things that is most enjoyable about life... 
    - For instance - decision making... 
    - decision making when you let a small society do really good decision making... it is super powerful... 
    - bad or mechanistic decision making is voting... campaigning... dictatorship... use of power to compel
        - and we fall back on those because they are easy to negotiate in a group... 
        - mechanical to say everyone gets a vote, we will vote, count, then maybe revote based on that... 
        - everyone understands the rules, but not a good way to make decisions
        - what you really want is a society to make decisions like how we balance childcare vs. infrastructure... 
        - activate the emotions... 
        - along with voting, founders believed in debate process...
        - a rich interaction of thinking and doing...
        - coming to a group sense of how it should be done... 
        - seeing a wave ripple over a group... where part of the group thinks it is wrong... 
            - and then the consensus emerges... 
    - This reminds Jordan of examples from [[Quaker]] decision making etc... 
- How it needs to emerge over time... 

## What Pete Has Called Massive Human Intelligence
- MHI was more about what Pete was doing than a grand design for anything . 
- MassiveHumanIntelligence.org 
- The diagram has the parts that pete would work on eith other people... 
- Massive Human Intelligence isn't a design for a superbrain... but it is hte parts of working on superbrain that Pete is interested and able to work on... 
- MHI is largely Pete with some people helping in various palces. 
    - an arm that runs servers 
    - Arm that does software dev
    - an arm that thinks about and documents and tests how decentralization and federation work 
    - a guild of people including Pete who work with knowledge systems and knowledge repositories and help people get knowledge into them and out of them 
    - Massive Wiki - that is kind of like a memory system... and it is also the social processes around memory... which include ways of helping people find what they need in the memory, and put what they know into the memory, because they may know something someone else may need to know in another time or place... 
        - takes knowledge out of the individual and local... so be accessed across time and place

## Kinds of Tools, and Reasons for Using Them
- People
- Process 
- Technology 

## Awareness-Collaboration Progression (and tools thereto)

- Awareness
    - Internal Comms
        - synchronous and semi-synchronous communication, i.e., chat systems, videoconferencing
        - chat systems enable awareness of each other's ideas. 
    - External Comms
        - Between the embodiment and the external world
    - Notes
        - Chat system is a way to get through the next few things... 
- Intention 
    - 
- Communication
- Relationship
- Commitment
    - Starts to bring in the need for structure and agreements 
- Coordination
    - Starts to bring in the need for PM backbone 
    - Tools to work together, draw diagrams together, make calculations together, analyze together
    - Starting to align... 
- Collaboration
- Higher Order Functional Unity / Oneness / Ideal 

## 
- Voting is a very simplistic mechanistic way to make decisions. 
    - there are better ways in a rich, robust, happy, drinks, party... sets up social fabric... friendships, lets us be in community wiht other people... then work in that community to talk things out, have ideas about how we should or shouldn't do something. 
    - positive discussions and arguments... on pros and cons... 
    - how do we make sure everyone gets fed, have enough resources for infrastructure projects, 
    - want a society of people to discuss that and work togehter in a human way... 
    - and if you do that right... 
    - it is a way for people to deliever on the potential for humans to work together... 
    - Superbrain also has that society affect of social engagement, social meaning making, social commitment... 
    - then collaboration because you have all the other levels of that progression taken care of... 

- Jordan 
    - Something like the Dunbar number - relationship with 150 people... or 100 people... 
    - some of those are friends and family... 
    - group size around 7... 
    - around 150... 
    - up to 1000s differnet interaction patterns... 
    - Each size its own patterns... 
    - Hypothesis One 
        - it looks like things scale to 150 or whatever... doesn't scale past that... 
        - if you have 75 groups - representatives 2 from each group form another dunbar number group... 
    - hypothesis two 
        - Pete is a small group expert - 3 to 7... 
        - There are lots of 7 to 20 person groups... 
        - Those groups naturally acrete into each other at about that size... 
    - A group of 7 to 20 with have interrelationships with another 5 or 10 grouops... 
        - and each of those anohte r5 or 10 groups they interact with... 
- Massive Wiki - 
    - could have 7 to 10 people... related to 5 or 10 groups... knows about other things.. 
    - This is a more realistic and practical way scale could happen... 
        - Bi-weekly plex dispatch... that is supposed to go several hops away through interconnections thorugh each of the groups... 
        - and kind of the way a society works... 
        - Creates the gossip netowrk of what is happening, who to be aware of, who is making commitments ot whom... 
        - and each "hop" may use a different set of tools for each thing... 
    - THEN NAIL THE COMMUNICAITONS AND BRIDGE PEOPLE... 
        - across chat / PM / knowledge systems... 
        - Then there are bards and story tellers... 
        - Plex is supposed to be a bard guild that goes around telling storeis of what is happening in the other groups... 
- A way to think about tools for being social / human... 
    - imagine yourself thousands of years ago... 
    - a plucky band of humans... 
    - how do you do decision making... decide things... 
    - pretend there are no tools...
    - when you want to add a tool - will this help this plucky band of humans or not... 
- a tool that wont help those humans will likely not help humans today... 

## Jordan's closing thoughts... 
- All the real Work that needs to occur... 
    - To meet the needs
    - solve the problems 
    - capture the opportunites
    - Present at any moment in the Story
- ...will happen in small groups of 3 to 20 people... 
- Each small group of 3 to 20 people needs to do the wise right thing relative to its unique context and function. 
- The 5 or 20 or 50 groups we are aware of... 
    - are not yet aware of one another... 
    - are not in communication... 
    - are not in relationship... 
    - are not ready for commitment... 
    - and are struggling with lower levels of (what Maslov's hierarchy / spiral dynamics) points to in a simplified way. 
- Therefore - it is not actually possible to accomplish the Meta Project right now in the abstract... 
    - Therefore Jordan needs to speak / broadcast to find the individual and local people and groups who believe they are flocking towards The Goal... 
    - And connect them up to a continuously improving set of solutions that meet their prioritized needs, solve their prioritized problems, and progressively invite and empower them to advance towards higher levels of consciousness and collaboration. 
    - Each individual and group Jordan and Lionsberg are serving has the right and responsiblity of individual and local self-governance and self-sustainability 
    - Each individual and group Jordan and Lionsberg are serving has the right and responsiblity to establish a relationship of reciprocity so that "That Which Is In Service To All" are nourished and abundant for All, and not depleted. 
- Jordan and Lionsberg need to focus on: 
    - Connecting, serving, and empowering the distributed network of autonomous small groups
    - We can do this through continuously improving the Quality of Lionsberg - as a community... as a platform... etc. 
    - If we succeed... eventually all people could eventually voluntarily connect to that platform if they wanted. 
        - Jordan's goal is to create a very valuable resource to empower any individual or group on earth to rise towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony and abundance. 
        - Each of 8 billion people, if this works, 
    - This can be thought of in many ways: 
        - A Community - engaged in what? 
        - A Platform - to empower what? 
        - A System - of what? 
        - Everything that is needed to empower individuals and localities to meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities inherent in their time and place in the Story.  
    - The only purpose and goal is to the Realize the Meta Goal. 
        - This requires inspiring the global community to design and build itself... 
        - so that together we can design and build the best possible future... 
- Jordan and Lionsberg need to model this (group of groups)... 
    - By forging a small committed team of 7 to 12... 20 at the outside... 
        - who will commit to trying to model what excellent group behavior in service of other groups looks like... and share out learnings...
        - and serve as a "hub" to listen to and support the emergence of a "group of groups" that are helping one another rise towards their potential and co-operate in whatever form of higher order functional unity is trying to emerge. 
    - Each of the 7 to 20 (hopefully)... will forge and join other small groups as well... 
        - to help forge the initial "gravity" of of 5 to 20 groups... 
        - that is substantial enough to attract and keep in orbit the other leaders and groups that Jordan identifies when speaking / broadcasting... 
- The purpose of the group working with Jordan... 
    - Will be to listen to, serve, enable the total set of all groups flocking towards The Goal... 
    - By continuoulsy improving the Quality of Lionsberg, whose purpose to is to serve All. 
    - If we are doing our job and creating enough value... 
        - we will end up with a "backlog / back-pressure" of individuals and groups wanting to take up their citizenship in Lionsberg and co-create / advance towards the best possible future we can envision at any time in the Story ... 
        - and we will set up an onboarding process / rite of passage of some kind... 
        - so that everyone is oriented and committed to the princples and values... 
        - while retaining full individual and local sovereignty / autonomy / self-governance... 
- What needs to happen is for small groups of people to get really good at working together... 
    - which will happen by getting really good at listening, meeting needs, and solving problems as they arise as obstacles to progress. 
    - To indivduals and small groups Getting A Little Better Every Day across all dimesnsions of being and doing. 
- The standard of success is for 8 billion people to be invited to take up citizenship / membership / co-stewardship of a System purpose-built to help all generations of life rise towards the fullness of their potential and flourish... 
    - while avoiding the patterns of failure / pitfalls that have plagued society to date. 
    - we can accomplish this by making Wise Right decisions in the domain we have influence over... which until we are faithful in it and thereby entrusted with more, is Lionsberg. 
- My commitment - 
    - all the resources, wealth, or power accumulated through this process will be transparently stewarded for the public / universal Good in a spirit of Love by those who take up citizenship / membership in Lionsberg. 
    - all elements of the system will retain the right and responsiblity of self-governance and sovereignty 
    - Everyone working on Lionsberg, and their descendents, will have an equal share along with all humanity in whatever value we co-create. 
    - Lionsberg will never be sold or subordinated to any other entity or instution 
    - In the event we allow Lionsberg to die, its resources will be distributed by the non-profit in accordance with non-profit law to the best organizations we can identify at the time who are prepared to advance the mission of designing and building the best possible future for all
