## Group Charter 
- what is our declared purpose? 
- how do our tech and people interact with one another
- how do our people interact with each other?
- making things "usable" for people

## Other Key Groups that need to function in parallel for this to work 
- Leadership / Navigation - vision / goal... 
- Wisdom / Advisory Council 
    - responding to the emergent, being ahead of the wave
    - Discernment, Startegy, Navigation... 
    - Jedi Council 
- Social Dimensions
    - is group psychology / energy / conditions that precipirate the ability to work together
- Technical Architecture (and Build, i.e., Design-Build)
    - How things work together, don't fall apart, function
- Social Architecture (and Build, i.e., Design-Build) 
    - responding to the present
    - Inspired by the need to make tech usable, also UI, branding, comms, community, network - the core idea is "Usability", and specific _design_ to make it more usable 
    - the "user experience" for everyone involved
    - includes "Onboarding Architecture"
        - see [[Onboarding Process]]
    - making sure that the whole system is well designed for people - for an entire society of individuals using it - productive and inspirational to one another, and not destructive... 
    - usability high
    - friction low
    - **easy** for people
    - problems solved, needs met
    - Pointers to low hanging fruit... 
    - Must argue and advocate for this perspective, which is different from nearby perspectives (like _just_ tech, or _just_ people)...

        - In Open Source - "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL)

            - Protection - ability to fork / clone 
            - Pattern of failure - when leader won't lead... 
        - ALIGNMENT... TOWARDS A VISION... WHERE MOTIVATION TO TAKE INITIATIVE... fall away (in paid organizations) 
        - REQUIRES A CRSTAL CLEAR VISION... 
            - a BDFL can always help everyone see the vision better 
            - Really clear vision 
            - you reach milestones... where things have transformed... there was a clarion call... and now I am confused... 
        - Authority comes from group knowledge that there is 
            - a crystal clear vision
            - a multitude of advisors 
            - a knowledge that deep thought and wisdom have gone in, and a desire to hear something very clear from the source idea holder.
