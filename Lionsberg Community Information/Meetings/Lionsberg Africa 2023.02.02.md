## Nail Something Down - And Start Working
- Sons of God - need to rise up, everyone with their strengths, back to the original intent and will. 
- I love the analogy of building - to see the reality of the fact that if you are building a home or a house... all has to come up together in a coordinated way...


## Metaphors 
- How can we see part of what we are doing as part of the bigger picture 
- Building a house 
- Building a body 
- Building a community 
- Building an environment / world / universe 

## House

- Cooling 
- Plumbing 
    - water 
    - sanitation 
- Electrical 
- Structural 
- Foundation 
- Roofing 
- Waterproofing 
- Security 
- Governance System

## Community

- Church / Faith Systems 
- Shopping / Distribution Systems 
- Roadways / Infrastructure Systems 
- Transportation Systems
- Playing ground / Play Systems 
- Community Center / Social Centers 
- Parks and Recreation 
- Systems of Employment / Work 
- Economic Systems 
- Education Systems 
- Electricity Systems  
- Food Systems 
- Counseling / Pychological Care Systems 
- Waste Management Systems 
- Sewage Systems 
- Storm Water Systems 
- Health Systems 
- Peacekeeper or Security Systems 
- Administrative of Governance Systems 

## Human Body 
- Spirit 
- Soul 
- Body 
    - Respiratory System 
    - Nervous Systems 
    - Digestive System 
    - Endocrine System  - Regulartory System 
    - Circulatory System - keeps everythin in a state of flow 
    - Skeletal System 
    - Reproductive Systems 
    - Muscular - Force and the power to get things done 
    - Urinary System 
    - Cardiovascular System 

## Nature / Environment / Living 
- Air 
    - Harmed by pollution 
- Water 
- Geo / Soil 
- Solid / liquids / gas 
- Soils 
- Microbiome 
- Plants 
- Animals 
- If you pullute the air, into toxic rain, affects the soil, plants, 

## Reflections
- There is no way to live in ignorance - cannot take care of one part of the body and neglect another, if you want the whole thing to happen 
- Everything that needs to be calibrated and aligned 
- Every joint and body part applied... 
- Complementarity - we all have a role to play, we all have our strengths, should therefore use them to make the system better, each and every action has an impact on the entire system 
- Cannot say it is someone elses duty 
- The earlier we start and do it well 
- The sharing of metaphors helps bring in the intuition, and see how it all works together, but each needs the other... 
- The whole body needs each thing to function together... 
- Governance - all these ecosystems - need to have a governing system 

## Practicality 
- The idea of an ecosystem that has EVERYTHING needed for flourishing and abundant life. 
- The idea of replicable patterns - [[Pattern Language]]
- Mapping / illuminating the functions of the (BODY / ECOSYSTEM)
    - The question for each function is not HOW - but WHO
    - What people or organizations are called to the complete functioning body / ecosystem that is lacking in nothing?
- Deep listening and understanding... so that we can properly diagnose and intervene very carefully in the complex adaptive system of systems 
- This will help us see the opportunities / gaps / needs - 
- in order to begin creating a complete ecosystem - a complete house... A dwelling place suitable for consciousness to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony. 

## Closing Reflections
- Jacque - Wonderful learning session - need to do a little more research - enlighten - Systems Thinking... 
- Daniel - Diagnosis and mapping very critical... 
- Waswala - Curious to know more about Jordan's background - Self-educated, no formal training 
- Nothing too hard, just putting our hands to the plow with faith...
- Edwin - Learning to think from multiple directions that interconnect. 
- Patrick - This is quite massive, maybe a month or so... you are really actually take us the biblical way, bringing the systems together... how individuals empowered by themselves, in a community, businesses empower from one another, and every need from an individual or businesses met because you are met, legal, policies that govern the whole system, young people empowered - mind boggling - quite massive... be slow in it, until we get it, because the foundation will matter a lot... 
- Whole community economic development... 
- Let's learn, develop, get knowledge.. 
- Christine - I have learned a lot today... the steps we are going to take in the next few weeks - it is something huge, but not insurmountable... we have the capacity, God has called us for this... as we go on in the coming ways, intelligent analysis and intelligent design to help us have a more intelligent understanding - as we create the map of all the functions... see what is needed, what is the issues, the needs, the opportunities... 
- Moses - I am now thinking of things from a systems view - thinking of cars - really enlightened - can't wait to see waht is next
- The principle of self-awareness, I am here, part of a solution... that God put me here - as part of a solution and not part of the problem... here to complement... 
- Start with what we are already doing...
