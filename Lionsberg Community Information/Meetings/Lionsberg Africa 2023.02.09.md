## From Last Week 
- The idea of an ecosystem that has EVERYTHING needed for flourishing and abundant life.
- The idea of replicable patterns - Pattern Language
- Mapping / illuminating the functions of the (BODY / ECOSYSTEM)
- The question for each function is not HOW - but WHO
- What people or organizations are called to the complete functioning body / ecosystem that is lacking in nothing?
- Deep listening and understanding... so that we can properly diagnose and intervene very carefully in the complex adaptive system of systems
- This will help us see the opportunities / gaps / needs -
- in order to begin creating a complete ecosystem - a complete house... A dwelling place suitable for consciousness to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony.

## Work, Systems, and Commons
- arise, to align things baack to original design... 
- This is the way, walk ye in it... 
- Transforming towards the image and likeness of God
    - in our character 
    - in the way we exist
    - in private 
    - in the open 
    - so we can be conduits of the FLOW of the Spirit 
    - Be imitators of God... 
- Ablity to overcome the systems of the world without any effort... 
    - not by power, not by might, but by the doing of the HOly Spiirt....

## Spirit Time 
- We ended up spending nearly the entire time sitting quietly in the presence of God. Priceless. 

## Closing Reflections
- Having this desire that God already had from the beginning of creation... flourishing... a place of flourishing... a place of harmony... a place of shymphony... 
- A future we would all like to thrive in... servanthood... pure love... 
- Phil 4:8 - whatever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, worth, praise - think on those things... 
- Speaking to the mountain - so it moves... the way... the system... the way of being... that enables us to be part of the flow... that moves mountains! 
- We must transform ourselves to pure love, for service to others, healing and lifting up the most vulnerable in society... 
- Amos 3:3 how can two walk together unless they are aligned... 
- Society has made us think it is scarce... have to get for us... greed... fear... an opportunity to partner itwh God... 
- Seek ye first the kingdom of God... 
- For me, I feel so at home, so safe here, a confirmation we are in the right place, doing the right thing...
