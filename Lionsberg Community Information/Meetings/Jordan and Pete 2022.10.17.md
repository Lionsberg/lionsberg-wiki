## Considerations

- is this too much like work?
    - rather than inspiration 
- academic learning model vs. practical learning
- new technologies for gathering? knowledge
- new technologies for finding and applying knowledge
- centralization 

- Top level concern - Jordan's Time - Pete thinks that lot's of people can do PM etc... and unique gift is inspiration 
- Pete thinks that lots of people can and have done what follows - so Jordan shouldn't be working on it... or thinking about it... 
- Examples 
    - Project Gutenberg a few decades ago - collect up free texts and reading materials... 
    - There are various lifetimes of work - we can go find them and invite them... 
    - Projects getting much of wikipedia and much of Khan etc. offline and onto thumbdrives etc... 
    - Drilling wells, planting trees... 
        - A couple small steps that leads to big impact... 
    - Well project by a firm out of silicon valley - amazing well design - and they couldn't distribute it because no one cared... 
    - Bottom line - a lot of solutions already out there to find and curate together... 

- Education System 
    - Educational and academic systems are broken... 
    - Often takes years to unwind and rediscover creativity / specialness / etc... starting entrepreneurial efforts at 12 instead of 27... 
    - The Way People Learn
        - School Pete likes best... started with Sudbury valley? school in NY... 
        - Like the idea of a jump page of all the knowledge - but that is more centralized and less effective than we need... 
        - Sudbury - has grounds, inside and outside parts, beautiful, libraries, computers, etc... 
            - there isn't a curriculum. 
            - there isn't anyone telling the kids what to do
            - There are adults there that can help kids with whatever they need to... 
            - Reading, writing, arithmatic, looking up stuff on internet - they are not forced, and they will not teach unless asked. 
            - Democratic system - kids and staff get votes... 
            - one person one vote 
            - Monthly or weekly community meetings... 
                - Address issues... 
                - Internal justice system run by the community
                - work through budget... 
                - evaluate proposals - costs, ROIs, reasons... 
                - Everything is a project (for doing colalborative stuff)
                - Not everything is a project for personal stuff... 
                - No one forcing action or learning... 
        - Essay on what school teaches - 7 lessons
            - Time on the clock more important than your learning
            - adults time more important than kids time
            - etc... 
            - Wrote a book called the Underground History of American Education... 
        - The reason we have classrooms, etc... American industrialists... last half of 18th century... looking for more factory workers... went over to Germany... found very structured calss educational system... (Prussian model successor?)... 
            - Basically to train factory workers... 
            - and to try to spread knowledge... 
        - Gotto says - 
            - a kid can learn all the math you need in say 6 months... 
            - Reading - if you start too early, get dyslexic - let them "pull plan" their reading... 
        - Sudbury - 
            - what happens to make people read or learn math... 
            - Is kid runs in, has a great idea... I am going to build x... 
            - I want to learn carpentry... 
            - You can go do research yourself... "I can't read" - ok - let me help you... 
            - at some point - "I hear about this reading thing... it seems scary... but i realize my goals can be met quicker... if I learn some things" 
            - As soon as you "need" the learning and are in a "teachable moment" - you can learn... instead of dragging kids through a month of learning area - learn in 10 or 15 minutes because they need it right now... 
    - It is not the knowledge - 
        - It is the SYSTEM OF HELP... 
        - And the creation of the basic learnings... 
        - that allow access to other SYSTEMS OF HELP... 
    - Maybe - Break down knowledge into micro-bites... that can be "pulled" as needed "just in time"
    - The academic system we inherited is poor... and it is not practical... 

- English
    - I like saying up front - 80% of worlds info is in English... one you learn the first 500 words you have unlocked half the worlds knowledge... 
    - AND - there is a lot to unpack... 
    - As primary English speakers - we are sitting on top of 800 years of toxic colonial domination... 
    - Before that it was toxic from other groups... beofre that Spanish... before that Dutch... 
    - Read "Dawn of Everything"
    - Read "Nutmeg's Curse"
    - Realize that what we have now is not all it is cracked up to be / presented as... 
    - There is a tremendous amount of unpacking to do with how you approach langauge - and essentially colonialism... 
    - Gist of Dawn of Everything -= is that we have a received understanding that human societies have been evolving and getter better for 1,000 years... and we are just honing and getting better... 
    - We have come up with lots of different ways to do society... 
    - some have domination and hierarchy as the core... 
    - Other did not... and they scaled up well... 
    - So the stories we know in our bones about how the world works are wrong... 
    - The Art of history and philosophy... goes back a few hundred years... we have inherited it... and it creates a 300 year fake understanding / lens of the way the world looks... 
        - So if it is not a dominance hierarchy and things always improving... 
        - then there is not the language for telling or understanding hte story... 

- Nutmegs Curse
    - Starts wtih Dutch and East India Company
    - story of colonialism and separation.... 
    - the duthc / spanish / english / americans etc. said we cna split humans away from nature, dominate it, subjugate it, and turn it into a resources instead of something that you live within and are a part of... 

- Guess 
    - You probably want to end up where you end up... learning English so you don't miss half humanity's knowledge... 
    - put in context that there are many ways to be together... 
    - many ways to do language... 
    - Metaphor for English
        - Nuclear energy and radioactive material... 
        - when you have decided you need an energy source, and you are going to use radioactive material for it... 
        - you put yourself in a different place - ok - we are dawning the lead aprons, taking out special measuring equipment, to be working here have to have serious training... 
        - the care and thoughtfulness with which you appraoch the nuclear superpowers... 
        - Same for English... 
        - English gives x... 
        - but comes with a lot of baggage... 
        - and if you are not careful... you can turn into the wrong thing... 
    - You speak these few langauges... 
        - Your culture is more important to you and your family than anything else, including english, america, disney... 
        - cherish your culutre, cherish your language, teach it to your kids... etc... 
    - And - it turns out English gives you superpowers... 
    - And - we should put an equal amount of effort towards translating back... 
    - Nuclear energy is one of the solutions going forward - 
        - but we weren't careful with it... 
        - Not that it is toxic and we should never use it... but respecting that it is toxic... work to mitigate... 
        - Small modular nuclear reactors... 
            - do you actually need that much? 
            - Is there something else we can use... 
            - It is careful engineering for energy... 
            - it is careful engineering for langauge and knowledge... 

- Thinking about Internet
    - access any info you want
- Thinking about AI
    - a kid who is learning calculus now or in 3 years... between internet... and what you can do with AI... 
    - AIs as thinking partners for us... changes the way you do things. 
    - And by AI - we mean 6 or 8 different things, some of which are useful and some of which are not... 
    - AIs helping you think through things... thinking partner.. knowledge mining partner... helping you collaborate... 
- Breaking the 100 courses... into 10,000 micro pieces... 
- Certifications
    - we rely on certification where we shouldn't
    - and don't offer certs where we should 
    - so we need better directories, better awareness... 
    - do I need a cert if I know more than teh people certifying me... 
    - A super Yelp system to tell me who best plumber in town is... and that they understand being up to code / base level... 
    - One level for skyscraper, another for hydroponics... 
    - Various certification domains...  
- Dawn of Everything
    - one reason to have a state - is that state has a monopoy on violence... and at some point police can show up... and compel
    - need more systems of governance not less... 
    - but need them to intercooperate... 

- Inspire people to join the cause... 
    - but don't centralize it... 
    - as soon as we start specifying the way to communicate - we start centralizing... 
    - the thing to work on is awareness, not communication. 
    - You don't want one of anything... including communication systems... 
    - in 18 months... instead of comms system - it will be a network
    - There are a couple dozen networks you want to know about... here are the 3 to 4 networks you want to join up with and co-mingle with... 
    - there isn't A - there is a number of them... 
    - The thing Lionsberg can do is talk about best practices. 
        - for forming a comms network
        - For creating commitment networks
        - and here are the 6 commitment networks we value... 
    - Is your program open source or not? 
        - Well - i call it open source, and it follows the best practices of the open source foundation... 
        - someone else can answer same way and say free software foundation... 
        - 3 or 4 natural rights bodies, not certifying bodies... no one forces you to get certified by any of those - but people will call you on it and shame you... 
        - certification / rating and ranking should be reputation and shaming people - you can't call yourself that because you don't follow any of the defintions... 
        - when you do follow, not that that body has certified you, but you assert here is the way I am following those best practices... 
            - a lot of community awareness and thinking 
            - you want multiple overlapping systems for everything 

## Hypothesis
- Go out and Inspire
- Invite
    - To what? 
- We have had a problem relying on self service... 
    - you want to get hooked up with a cohort... 
    - cohort is hooked up with a couple mentors... 
    - "You are asking the wrong people for help" 
        - what you need to do is find your cohort / support group / people in the same condition... 
- Meta project is about joining up and working together - starting on a microcosm and growing into a macrocosm...

## Basic minimum viable Communications System... 

## Rising Towards Collaboration

We realized / learned that we tried to skip some steps in moving stragith towards collaboration and program management.

Hypothesis / current best understanding is that our eventual collaboration will likely organically emerge through a progression that might be something like:

- awareness
- intention
- communication
- relationship
- commitment
- coordination
- collaboration 

This is something like the basic physics of relationship... like Maslow's hierarchy or spiral dynamics... you simply aren't going to collaborate unless you have gone through the other steps. 

Also - groups are going to move through them at different paces... 



## Systems for Each Phase...
- Without systems for each phase we won't be able to ladder up a stable structure... 

- Minimum monthly Comms... (in a format that we agree to that allows for maps / visulations to be presented back to the Whole so it can become aware of itself.)
- Unstructured comms between people as they fit 
- How can we build a culture that celebrates and takes the time to communicate and get to know one another... so that the possiblity for deeper relationship and collaboration emerges...
