# Meta Project Navigation, 2022-08-10

## Summary of today's meeting

_tbd_

## Some Topics

- the close of our third 6 week cycle
- really focusing on retrospective
- next week: Vincent co-hosting a needs and resources mapping session

## Planning the Retrospective 

- Hear from everyone 
- What I'd like to hear about / care more about / really appreciate the deepest things... not just superficial things... the things that really touched us and made me happy / joyful / amazed... or really disappointed me... let me down... 
- Make a list of Questions...FAQs 
    - what _are_ our deepest questions?
    - what are the deepest questions about what we're doing?
- Make a list of ways our thinking about the Meta Project has evolved, where it started, where it is now... to inform the questions... that will help put together clearer definitions and presentations... basis for a good FAQ... 
    - we don't know where the mental blocks are, we don't know what we're answering, and so, we are the beta test for whether we can explain it clearly, and also it would be the basis for a really good faq on any of our sites.
- Waterfalls
    - Help surface what is in the room before we influence one another
    - Harder to get what shows up after people start speaking... 

## Topics to Discuss 

- Difficulty: Levels of analysis / abstraction... - when I think about retrospective, I think about the levels of retrospective in terms of specific things, to more general things, to broadest things
    - Formulate with more detail the specifics of Vision, plans, clarity, what we are hoping to provide first, etc. etc. 
    - There are still questions... and we still don't have all the answers... 
    - we might still have different ideas of what "this" is about... 
    - whatever we can cohesively say is "the umbrella" and then, what's under that umbrella?
- Want to know, How to describe Meta Project to other people... 
- Breakdowns - when obstacles or failed efforts cause reduction of momentum
    - few people have joined Catalist

## Waterfall Questions

- The trick with waterfall answers is to not share them before Jordan says go... 
    - Compose somewhere else, then copy / paste into zoom chat
    - Trick to mulitple lines in Zoom chat is Control+enter 
- How are we describing Meta Project? 
- What are questions we or people have about what the meta project is... 
- What story would you share about Meta Project to Show how it is working? 
- What story would you feel uncomfortable sharing but you know needs to be shared? 
- Whose contributions have impacted you the most? 
- Bravespace question: something you believe you should share, and something you are holding back on from sharing.

## Waterfall Answers

### Answers to Q1, What are questions we or people have about what the meta project is

Question One: I'm not describing with anyone as I am not yet convinced that anyone investing time besides myself is a useful near term investment of their time. I

Question One: People only have questions after I first tell them something about it. I do that when I find someone open to thinking creatively and honestly about big issues in society, government, environment, etc. Then they wonder how it plays out in practical terms. I find myself telling them how they might fit in when they wonder who is involved.

Question One: What is it?

Question One: How is it different from (all the other things using similar language)?

Question One: Isn't that impossible?

Question One: What are you FOCUSED on? It seems too vague / broad / abstract... what specifically are you doing?

Question One: How is this different than (xyz)...?

Question One: This sounds like the same language as xyz - shouldn't we just join up with them?

Question One: Who is involved?

Question One: Who is the team?

Question One: What have you already done / built in the past?

Question One: How does it fit with all the other people / organizations / groups working on similar things?

Question One: How dare you?

Question One: What is Meta Project trying to do?

Question One: What's the difference between Lionsberg and The Meta Project?

Question One: Need considered description, with info re range of projects (geographically, scale (individual/group/larger group), who & how  do we connect & share, how do we help, knowing skills and capacity of participant(s) & participant groups, what are the “rules”, to who do we direct questions, & how communicate.

Question One: I hold it one way, others here hold it several different ways. There is overlap and there are differences. I know less about what Meta Project is now than I thought I knew when I joined, but it is even more interesting now than then, as it is emerging very richly and is complex.
	
Question One: When I describe to people, I always say this is how I hold it to be, but it has not gelled into “one thing” and may not end up being how I hold it now to be/become. 
	
Question One: Question I can’t answer is to pin down what exactly Meta Project is, who it is for, what they get from it, why should they want to join and actively participate (beyond just joining). There are thoughts and conversations pointing in that direction, but not yet clarity. But people always get excited when I talk about Meta Project - always!

Question One: What are some of the expected outcomes of the Meta Project?

Question One: What is the end game?

Question One: Or is the Meta Project more related to method/process and less related to final outcomes?

Question One: I’m not sure that I would place a priority in explaining it to others, I believe in coherent frequency magnetizing itself. I see opportunity for group alignment practices, unified organization workflow, collective manifestation. This project is something you feel. I experience this group having great potential to move from the filter of the mind to enter more deeply the heart space.

Question One: When will Meta Project be receiving its first funds?

Question One: Is Meta Project working with any of the many other similar projects?

Question One: Where is a good executive summary of Meta Project?

Question One: How many people are involved but who aren’t present in meetings?

Question One: What is the relationship of the metaproject to Meta?

Question One: What is the relationship of the metaproject to the metaverse?

Question One: What is the relationship of the metaproject to the meta-crisis?

Question One: Are you (the group of ~50) the metaproject, or a small part of the metaproject?

Question One: Does Jordan run the metaproject?

Question One: What is Lionsberg?

Question One: Does Jordan run Lionsberg?

Question One: Where do other orgs fit in?

Question One: What problems don’t you address?

Question One: After asking or my sharing, people quickly jump into 'helping' by Providing other examples of similar initiatives not exploring what is happening.

Question One: A quick  oh - AND you should know about say - tech soup

### Answers to Q2, What has made you happy and joyful as you worked with MP? With specific details

Question Two: That when I need help or advice, I can find someone to listen. The reciprocal of that, when others are interested in how I might contribute they reach out. I am currently having close exchanges, more regular now, with four or more meta project people and the relationships are getting richer. It's not about a tech help thing, it is more a cadence around listening to, deeply, how might I serve you in this moment. Honoured that happens even with timezones - we make time and space for each other. Learning to move at a slower pace to move faster overrall

Question Two: I get the most joy from the individual connections made through these months. I truly admire and treasure people here, and many of them would never have been in my world without this project. The common thread of feeling like there is work to be done, it CAN be done, and WE are part of that work is moving and energizing.

Question Two: What has made me happy and joyful is the people and the space. 6 months ago there was only a vague notion of where the people were that i could work with on the global goals and grand challenges, who were more attached to the spirit of this moment in history, and less attached to any particular brand or concretization. It has been amazing to be able to co-create a space where we can all show up and talk at this level. To Wendy's prompt, I am sitting here on my balcony... alone... but not alone, because I now know that wherever I am in the world, and whatever I happen to be doing that week, there is a group of people willing to step outside of their individual story lines and quests to engage together in that which is bigger than all of us. I am on calls with people driving in cars in Africa, or South America, or Europe... and the connections are imperfect, but here I am on my balcony, talking with a friend in Africa, who is driving home from a critical meeting that could impact the future in significant ways.

Question Two: Co-creating a better world, within the framework of equitable stakeholders with shared core values.. Meta can provide the tools for global networking and ideation, creating  a safe space for interaction and innovation. The opposite of money / relationship driven project methods.

Question Two: Sitting in my office, staring at my computer screen, typing on my keyboard, often typing the wrong keys, I am keenly focused on how the MP is similar to my vision for Civilization 2.0. The latter has been accumulating in my mind and on text composition tools, for years. I have asked myself many hard questions and managed to come up with answers to some of them and hope to crowd source answers for the remaining ones. Crowd sourcing here and in other meetings and folks over those same years, it makes me happy to add a new answer. Meeting people one on one has been more wonderful than in our larger meetings. Adding mass to my vision brings joy into my heart. Receiving acceptance and feeling involved

Question Two:  The many specific people I've met and the relationships being developed

Question Two:  Experiencing a group with a high density of those on the spectrum and their unique value and challenges

Question Two:  The audacious vision of what's possible, linked with the challenging work of manifesting tangible impact.

Question Two: I have found in 1-1s with Jonathan the opportunity to run some practical ideas about Lionberg by him and get helpful and reflective feedback. I think this is one benefit of a group like this where we can get feedback on specific projects we are working on. 

Question Two: I have been encouraged in seeing likeminded interest from others in the Wednesday meetings. It tells me that what we have been doing for 4 years in Lionsberg does indeed resonate with others.

Question Two: I have learned other perspectives that opens my mind to other projects getting at different issues or different aspects of the big issues.

Question Two: I enjoy working with Jordan when we're talking about the potential that Meta Project has to change the world, and the way Jordan is infectiously enthusiastic. Jordan is particularly good at helping all of us see things in a positively light, and helps us all orient towards our best purpose when we chat on the phone or on Zoom.

Question Two: Seeing other people be inspired by all of working together makes me happy, too.

Question Two: listening, openness, love, passion, compassion

Question Two: Happy & joyful re the richness of all the people, their wisdom and insight, and the builidng sense of community and belonging. Great good will and heart.

Question Two: My greatest joy comes from feeling the energy and the resonance. And Jordan, you set it up sometimes just by how you speak, and where you bring us, and we continue among ourselves, and other times it's other people. But I use my body as an antenna, and so I watch how I feel, and what is my experience in situations, when people speak about topics, and so on. And where are we going together in coherence as a group is, we go to amplify the resonance between us. And when we do that, then I find myself so expanded that brings me a great joy. I find the insights more available and intuition more open. There's trust, and safety, and bravery in the group to be real and to be good as well as to go to where they're suffering, and there are very few spaces where there's permission and validation to go high and big and expansive, and here we have that I feel that. And when I feel that it brings me immense joy because I then can express myself from the higher, and I can meet others when they do that.

### Answers to Q3: what's something that's been disappointing or frustrating, and what might we do better about that in the coming cycle?

Question Three: The impact and decrease of engagement that resulted from lack of clarity, and the lack of ability to harvest and deploy energy into measurable, transparent practical cases. Lacking these cases, the energy feels defused and declining. 

Question Three: Yet, an untapped potential is dormant below the surface should the needed capital, resources and tools become available to stimulate measurable progress.

Question Three: Challenged by and in awe of the richness (on multiple levels) of the participants. Wonder if we could do more asynchronously, then return to group. Could we then support/encourage/help. Would that help us to engage others?

Question Three: Everything seems to more go slowly, and with more steps and misunderstandings, than I would like. We have a hard time getting traction, and it's hard to coordinate well.  It's hard to understand where the center of energy is, and how we might have more people work on it productively.

Question Three: In the next cycle, perhaps we can try to do less, but do it more coherently.

Question Three: I joined late in the cycle, so I still don't have a good sense of each person's background / 'life story'.. would help to know each other better. Maybe this info is stored somewhere that I'm now aware of. Or maybe we can take time at the beginning of next cycle to get to know each other better.

Question Three: I am finding it difficult to balance leadership and the desire for decentralization and autonomy. I feel the same thing that others have expressed frustration about in terms of "speaking into a void”. There is so much amazing work happening, in so many corners, and without us all being "full time" working on the same thing, it is a completely different kind of leadership and organization that is required... which I don't know if we have quite figured out yet. Hypothesis: I think we need to ensure that each "node" of leadership or action has a strong core team around it helping navigate and communicate. I think we need to get better for forging and coordinating small effective teams, and seeing what is happening across that total “team of teams". I would also like to see how we can present out the value that is being created in a way that fuels the economy that help provide for all the amazing people in the network.

Question Three: There is a big challenge for me to work with others in the USA with timezones. Each morning is so precious and each relationship is so precious. Yet the practical thing of assigning those short hours to the conversations I want or even feel I need to have is difficult to do. How do I stay healthy, think well and connect solidly with others when there is such a small overlap? I have deep gratitude for the people who pop in at the ends and starts of their day. Perhaps we can use our office hours as a marker for wider and more interesting exchanges - to see when I might have that deeper converation about a topic. I am going to use Remo for that.

Question Three: What I will also do is to become a go-to person to help us all gain a language for complexity. If it suits others to learn more about now the Cynefin Framework is a useful short form for helping us navigate. By using office hours to create a platform for exploring this once a week I will get good at doing this.

Question Three: When I offer something to the group, it seems I don’t quite have the magic to invite curiosity or questions. It feels like rejection. And yet, I also see the flip side which is that all of us are offering something to the group and not much is pursued. I do not have a suggestion or solution yet, although, perhaps each offering might become a “wow, let’s meet later over this one” and … well, i am not quite sure. This is my fundamental frustration with MP.

Question Three: Thinking of the Lionsberg path, and how it gave birth to the idea of an overall community, I have found myself wondering how long it will take the practical aspects I have worked on to actually come into being and begin supporting many projects in practical terms. I wonder if it is a matter of needing to cultivate patience on my part, or if I need to be more pro-active and focused. Appreciating the supportive community of the metaproject has counterbalanced that sense of delay, however.

Question Three: The metaproject is bold in the height of its vision, but it could be bolder in its breadth. I find myself wanting to focus outward and under others, not as much inward focus on our own procedures and practices.
