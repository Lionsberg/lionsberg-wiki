# Jordan and Peter 2022.11.29

- You are not broken. 
- Forge or join a resonate group. 
- Tendency - to want to get whole first... 
- the rate of opening vs. closing loops 
- convening... and then making people feel like they are working on same goal... superpower.
- The problem - 
    - When we get together... we can feel like we are accomplishing something just because we are together... 
    - The yin yang balance 


## OODA and other cycles

- observe-orient-decide-act
- plan-do-check-act
- scan-identify-plan-decide-execute
- Many that end with learning... / retro to restart the cycle. 

## Comments
- No "brave enough" to X... 
- Jordan has loops with each person and can't get us all through all the loops 
- "governance" problem
- My gut / intuition says ... 
    - that the sovereign thing would work 
    - in lieu of large scale coordination... 
    - it is enough for each Sovereign - to decide what it is going to do.... don't have to worry yet whether and how it "fits" 
    - The important thing is that it execute what it believes in effectively... 
- Many people didn't feel part of a 'sovereign' - and didn't know how to start... 

## It Would Be Nice
- To have a directory to say here are the things I am working on... 
    - Problem - it is hard to describe... what the piece is... 
    - Hard enough to describe to a friend... 
    - The way through the sovereign thing - is negotiation. small scale. 
    - If you have a small sovereign - negotiate with another small sovereign if you can help one another... 
    - and trying to do that through a directory is a impossible thing. 
- Negotiation - then agreements 
    - especially pair-wise negotiation, at least to start

## Non Trivial Point
- Some individuals are in groups
- Some are not... 
- Some of my reasonably enlightened friends who get this don't necessarily play well in groups... 

## Two Problems
- Getting lost in abstraction 
- Trying to get too many minds around too big of a thing 
- Jordan (or anyone) having individual loops and not being able to bring them together (maybe or maybe not a problem)

## Approximate Consensus  
- Jordan in several sovereign autonomous groups doing meaningful things. 
- Prefer groups - where like ithing - I am willing to spend 5 or 10% of time and resources exploring higher coordination. 

## Lessons From Entrepreneurship
- Can't say yes to every deal that comes along - have to evaluate the time you spend and relationship in light of resrouces constrains and goals. 
- Learn how to do business development, say no to potential opportunities and yes to the ones that will really advance. 
- Hierarchy of Partnerships
    - Is this potential  

# Partnership / Deals / Agreements

- my org can source deals that it wants, rather than just depending on what comes in over the transom
    - actually out hunting and sourcing 
- Defining in advance the decision making criteria / matrix around potential deals
- evaluating the deal from our org's point of view - do we think this will this be good for us?
- expressing a potential deal to a partner - what's in it for them? what's in it for us?
- negotiating terms of the deal
- executing on the terms of the deal
- learning and iterating this deal and other deals
- learning to terminate bad deals

- "negotiating is maybe a gateway drug to learning the rest of it"

## Two Negotiations / Deals / Commitments / Agreements 

- work on building a mind 
    - Parts of that 
    - This month 
- work on organizing Lionsberg 

## Next Call - Jordan and Pete
- Break building a mind and building Lionsberg down into parts... and discuss possible immediate next steps. 

## Next Call - Lionsberg
- Make it a social call... 

## Non-Violent Communication

- what exactly happened (observation)
- what you feel about it (feelings)
- what is important to you (needs)
- what you might ask someone or yourself to satisfy this need (requests)
