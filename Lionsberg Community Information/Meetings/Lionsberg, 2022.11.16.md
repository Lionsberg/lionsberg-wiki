# # Lionsberg, 2022.11.16

## Where Are We? 


- 5-7 years
- work site earth
- greater goals
- critical path
- work on legal financial
- smaller groups
    - Maybe all the work that actually needed to based on the sovereign autonomous action of of 3 to 20 people.
- maybe something like a mind would be required.
- kind of the first stage of a the brain: https://lionsberg.wiki/
- 4 x 6 week cycles evaluating Meta Project (in the abstract)
    - now instantiate in practice
    - 7 year time horizon - future backwards stated in days
    - connecting up groups now
    - using platform created to date
    - evaluate mechanisms as we go - measureable
- "from here it gets really measurable"

Reflection question: What is the story that you're you're telling yourself about where we are? How does that align or not with Jordan's story?

- the notion of games
- connecting and empowering distributed network of small groups could be called anything
- children's book, "myth"

## Questions

- when measuring, what kind of measuring?
- how is this project related to me?
- How if people come in drama and are called to do good, how can we 'coregulate' at the outset so not in tension 
- what is a "high functioning group of 3 to 20 people"

## What story

Erik's questions
- How do we start this?
- How do we start getting making things really concrete?
    - A lot of concrete things have already happened.
- I don't know about working groups and stuff like that so I'm curious about the infrastructure that's already there.

- Pete K
    - appreciation of Jordan's current story
    - curious about 'high functioning group of 3-20 people' 
        - what is high functioning, for example
- Jordan
    - Legal structure and governance structure to use now
    - [Lionsberg Integrated Delivery Guide](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_system_design/the_way/the_lionsberg_system/lionsberg_integrated_delivery_guide/lionsberg_integrated_delivery_guide) 
    - Listening deeply
    - Looking for the generalised solutions
    - Load these onto the platform
    - Look for network effects

Lionsberg, Meta Project Disambiguation

Marianne -
    We need to try with a smaller instance
    
Marjorie Kelly & Kate Raworth offer gaining clarity on:
1. Purpose
2. Network
3. Governance
4. Ownership
5. Finance

The Different Lionsbergs
- Lionsberg the Idea or Myth
    - I like the idea and I am part of a movement; hovering and in principle support it
- Lionsberg the Voluntary Association 
    - I turn up and you, 'Lionsberg Volunteers' , accept my gift so I am a member
- Lionsberg the Core Enterprise 
    - I come because I am a formal member and I promise and do things reliably  for 'Lionsberg Core Enterprise' and the relationship also provides benefits in ways that are meaningful to me.
- Lionsberg the Legal Structure 
    - I have a formal role with responsibilities as law for the activities of 'Lionsberg Legal'

Proposed Lionsbergs and/or Roles
- A Monitoring Group (along with the Core Enterprise)
    - And when we have a couple of prototypes, what will we see or hear to know we have evidence that what we are doing is working or is not working?
- A Copywriter (explainer in simple terms)


Questions
Peter K
    How do they inter relate
    Which one are we talking about
    Dig into each deeply - this takes time - not zooming past this
    
    -

Pete's order for today:
- Governance 
    - sort of a myth, but there's a structure
    - 501(c)(3), sole board member is Jordan
- Structure
    - level 1: kind of an idea
    - level 2: a voluntary association of individuals
- Purpose
- Participants (individuals or groups/projects)
- Resources (financial or otherwise)
- What is membership?
    - Is it another form than membership
- What are roles and mandates belonging to those roles

## Erik
- There might be leverage in first engaging and supporting other organizations... 
- Need the right kind of people, quickly enough, to reach in and support... 
- Offered to be an advisor to help shepherd the next steps.

How is this group here, forming & the performing?  
Need a shared understanding of how we can work, help and present to those outside this group.  
Need to practice a learning loop.  
Pick Experiments in 4 key areas - decide on those.  Apply within a month.  Learn and iterate again n cycles.
