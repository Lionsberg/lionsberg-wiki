## When to use HackMD, when to use Obsidian

- since HackMD and Obsidian (along with other tools) use Markdown, it's very easy to move notes between them
    - 1. three dot menu
    - 2. download Markdown
    - 3. save to correct directory on your computer
    - 4. in HackMD (optional, Save As Version)
    - 5. in HackMD, delete all note content and leave a header at top about `# moved to wiki (wiki name)`
    - 6. (if you're using Git) commit and push changes
- HackMD for synchronous things, like Zoom meetings
    - often "ephemeral"
- Obsidian for asynchronous, longer term writing
    - persistent, but not real-time collaborative yet
