## Misc Notes from Coffee Time
- Triangulating towards answers 
- Discovering whether patterns we perceive are real 
- Perceived crazy 
    - when are you outside the domainant narrative 
- So many have felt so alone for so long 
- Book - the dawn of everything - rewriting narrative. Many members of the group have resonated. One person telling a story in one way, but creates the permission to open and retell the stories of history and how we got here. 

## Main Meeting 
- Arriving at shared understanding of values and behaviors and norms 
- How to achieve deepest and most logical thought - with most whole hearted and open process - so we are not holding anything back bout initiatives, plans, conflict, etc. 
- might want to consider labels for those categories - for what we think are some of the core values of how we want to operate
- Simpatico of the group - that builds to that shared level of trust - that would bring clarity when we encounter situaitons that seem cloudy... 
- Different layers and complexity to the work 
- each group needs to navigate, find their own way, establish their own norms, values for working together, addressing things AS THE WORK UNFOLDS... 
- it is through the work that the hard things, the conflicts, the opportunities arise... 
- THROUGH THE REAL WORK... 
- one thing to declare in hypothethetical - vs. pulling the layers back and being together... in the work... 
- The conversations ABOUT - that float around in the hypothetical... 
- harder - in really getting the work done, seeing the interconnections... 
- Time together as real humans sharing what is happening in our own lives... in effort to be efficient often cut that out... 
- Challenges in people's lives tell us about values that are there in people's lives in different contexts... 
- I have my own life, my own vision of what we are doing together... 
- Then what we are doing collectively... 
- Our takes on what is happening inside and outside...
- And if we miss that fall out of step with internal, external, project - 
- 10 minutes at beginning catches up with with self and other 
- 5 minutes of mediation time to come to ground, settle, know what you are brining
- Knowing we can be heard... sharing... the genuine listening to each person... 
- Makes for long processes - you can say let's get more efficient - but those deep elements have to be part of the process... 
- Also need the context in which those values turn up... 
- How do we walk the talk, be more congruent, what to gently suggest, how much variation to naturally allow... 
- on one hand know there are things to do to lead to richer better results... 
- and if we prescribe too much that has limitations as well...
- Undersatnding getting the right people in the right places at the right time... 
- the different flavors of conversations we talk about as if they are the same... whose articulations help us identify the nature of each conversation... so we can talk about them with more discernment 
    - 1. We are in the room, not sure what needs to emerge, and allowing it to emerge, and then it is most important for deep trust, patterning that allows all voices to be heard. people in room are what comes first... need to be a constant so the thing between can be realized. 
    - 2. we have a topic or need, something partially in progress, don't yet have all the right people in the need - define the need, and invite people who feel they align with that value or trajectory - and we invite them in... topic or thing is the constant, and people invited in to discern what comes next
    - 3. further down the road - something is working really really well, having trouble with something / challenge / do more - they have maxed out, need colalborative effort - coming at different skill set, supporting the ecosytem around something that already is... 
- Different kinds of conversation... 
    - enablement 
    - discernment 
    - kindness 
    - value words that help us maintain human dynamics that are defined and constant... 
    - everyone has their antena tuned to are we real, are we candid, are we helpful...
- Define the flavor of each conversation, with the set of values that go with that conversation, and when conversation is facilitated - even better because you can only know it in action... 
- "To know the way one must live it"
- the words and definitions are the beginning - then facilitation and coaching are key - to specifically hold space for those dynamics... 
- The need for moderation to help keep conversation on track... the moderation is shepherding the conversation... 
    - the times to affirm 
    - the times to correct and guide 
    - the times to place things in their places and tracks 
    - The parking lot 
    - everyone affirmed because their issue is not lost, happening in order... 
- Kantor - Four Player Model 
    - someone who advocates
    - supports
    - opposes
    - watches the room - observer
    - dynamic experience in dialogue... 
    - when one of those four players aren't in place, making sure those places are filled 
    - precludes a specific objective 
- Extreme Transparency 
    - Ways to support the values we are working through together 
    - feedback mechanisms offline or sideline... 
    - "Dot collector"
- What the structures are to change the patterns... intention...
- The layers of abstraction 
- Facilitation / hosting / shepherding at each level of abstraction - the person who will take care of hte different roles we want to take... in various conversations... 
- What I have missed is having a kind of structure - 
    - In martial arts - you do need a structure 
    - you do need kata 
    - you do need protocols 
- What would make our conversations in the future stronger 
    - is designing where conversations need what kind of structure... 
    - and help us to keep to the structure we have decided we like 
    - how people work together at different levels and help one another... 
    - Working with people up and down in capacity during the sessions - peer coaching and iron sharpening iron... 
    - a process to help people understand how proficient they may be... 
- WENDY WISH 
    - this space next week - pick one of those types of conversations / flavors - and come together to practice in action on that 
    - Rather than going into a small group and coming back 
    - using this group as a model 
    - and this group becomes a space of learning what is working well and not - so we have a vibe or a space of how it fits in... 
    - This needs to be a **home base**... where we come back, and the cycle that is created here stays here... 
- What is this group going forward... 
    - Deep sharing 
        - learning of behaviors observed, observances, what is occuring in other settings 
        - what others have learned in an event... 
    - Home base 
- Groups intercting between the meetings... 
    - Decisions groups help lead
    - having there being a bouncing off in this session 
    - so the coalescing of the holistic can come together 
    - time space between one thing and another 
- Careful not to build a structure that has to fed via old systems resources... the ENTRAPMENT POTENTIAL... 
- From Killu in Zoom chat - Stuart Kauffman is a scientist very interested in self organizing systems.  You can see his books here. https://www.google.com/boo ks/edition/The_Origins_of_Order/lZcSpRJz0dgC?hl=en.  
 Stuart is also author of the concept: Adjacent possible.  I, with others, have played around with one of his concepts: Patches and Nodes. Patches are groups like LeCiel and all the others we are wanting to partner with.  Nodes are you and I and all the people who live and work within these groups.  It is the nodes here who act like bees looking for honey. Each node is connected to no more than three other nodes each randomly chosen from other groups.  Each node communicates with the other nodes at least monthly with a conversation that : 1 share the health and well being of their patch; 2 Find out what each needs; and what they have to share; and if there is work they should be doing together.  
    Each node then returns to their home group and shares this information. The patch decides: 1.There is some useful information here, let's learn more; 2 There is real excitement with this patch because they "just got funding", "reached an important goal", etc. etc; ; 3 We have an opportunity to work with this patch; etc. If the nodes do make an effort to connect and report/share, the whole will settle on a higher order over time and forge a new organization. A few of us have played with this concept but it is still waiting a good effort over time with diverse groups.
    Stuart warns: if there is too much connection -- trying to have whole groups meet with other whole group, you will likely get gridlock and the inability to make worthwhile decisions; if the communication is too scarce, you will get entropy and early death.   He has created all of his models by working with nature's ways: order and randomness working together.  There is a lot of complexity in getting this idea started but with the diversity and # of groups, it might just be a great way to scale and shift into a new reality.

- Self-organizing systems. Nodes and patches. Multiple working groups. Quick overview of there is a lot of energy around this, here is something happening,

- HOME PATCH OR NODE... 
- The other patches and nodes having cross-connections with the other places... 
- Wise informed decisions of self-governance... based on colelctive synthesized ifnormationa... 
- Then spaces to rise above, say what is missing here... in complex systems the things you most need to know are not the noisiest ones... what are we not noticing, it is the gaps, the places not talking... 
- Counter pattern that stirs things up - brings the disorder in - to break up the pattern that crept in... the wild card, the gester... 
- THIS IS HOW CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS... 
    - calibrate what needs to get differentiated 
    - what needs to get integrated 
    - then teh breaking of the pattern and continue to adapt...- 
- Finding ways to help these things happen naturally... 
- The issue of the word permeability - the right balance of things coming in and going out... 
- Compelexity of balance between coherence of what we are seeing, and what is missing, what is divergent, if we become too coalesced we will shut out things that counter our understanding that may be essential to future success... hwat might we be missing here? open ended quetsions that invite us to test the hypothesis... 
- COMMS GROUP 
    - taking information in 
    - presenting information out
-  Making progress... what are we not yet seeing... multiple people in multiple groups.. go with the structure, learn how it works... 
-  WENDY - TWO TAKEAWAYS FROM LAST SPINNING OUT AND FIZZLING
    -  What type of conversations is being expected to happen in each group... before the groups organized by topic... trying to move into action was hard - because some want to have converstaion at diffrent levels of abstraction 
    -  what converation is needed by ecosystem or wanted 
    -  feedback loop and accountability 
    -  something to bounce it against... 
-  The need for a mirror - to get a sense of whethe rwe are on the right track... 
    -  to put energy in the wrong place 
    -  feels wasted 
    -  if energy and contributions aren't moving towards something
-  Each group finds a way to capture what is not being discussed - what did we miss - what needs to be discussed - a way to capture.... 
-  Sense of learning across the entire organization... 
-  WORKING INTO A VACUUM / NO MIRROR LEAD TO PREVIOUS FIZZLING... 
-  Need to capture the through - if you are having that thought, write it down and let's talk later... 
-  Continuous learning across the whole 
-  processes that enable focus and discernment, as well as sidelines... 
-  Agree that efforts weren’t validated, acknowledged, placed somewhere, appreciated, celebrated by the ecosystem, which are less about the ego and more about validating direction and priorities, so that people know what they’re doing is of value, right now, here, in this ecosystem
-  Need liberty with. constraint... the constraint and structure is what helps the growth... 
-  ++Wendy M, the lack of such mirror reflecting back, and sense of working into vacuum, is likely what led to prior efforts fizzling-agree or not?
-  I think no matter what the structure of the organization, the feedback / accountability is essential to continued alignment, motivation and engagement.
-  Wendy E - Judy this idea of residuals has synergies with Residuality Theory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IqczEd88A
-  Pushing against, boundaries, also PULLING 
    -  people in a state of flow - group flow state... 
    -  how to pull / attract people forward... 
-  how to bring out the best of people - people declare what is most passionate and helpful... 


Wendy M's Summary notes: Reflecting on the fizzling that happened last summer
* the lack of such mirror reflecting back, and sense of working into vacuum, is likely what led to prior efforts fizzling Part of the struggle was, we know how this works in hierarchical yraditional organization/group, but not in flat, more self-organizing, decentralized groups
* Agree that efforts weren’t validated, acknowledged, placed somewhere, appreciated, celebrated by the ecosystem, which are less about the ego and more about validating direction and priorities, so that people know what they’re doing is of value, right now, here, in this ecosystem. I think no matter what the structure of the organization, the feedback / accountability is essential to continued alignment, motivation and engagement.

* And some constraints are necessary to increase focus and action. 
* gaps are KEY. Feel like holistic frameworks help us to ‘see’ what is missing.  Do people have other ways that have worked well?

* Acknowledging we are "messy humans" as it meets "let's see how best to invite the best of each"  

- Wendy 
    - A space where I can come share what I have learned in the other groups - and where I am doing work 
    - And from all the sharings we see if something is not getting attention that needs attention **(GAPS)**, or ID **synergies** that exist between and among all the groups and what they are doing 
    - Human beingness together... 
    - Sharing and listening deeply to what is not being said, not being shared.
    - Asking quetions we don't know the answers to yet... 
    - There is a magic here in this group - 
    - The connective energy makes possible to venture into the unknown - and now need the experiences to feed that space...
    - Part of the cohesiveness is the allowance of the divergence of the group... 
- The unstated divergence is the critical issue... 
- We have spent a lot of time on X - I am sure some of you have divergent thoughts from X... 
- Soliciting the after-notes and thoughts... 
- Becomes about the right next question being asked... 
- Does anyone have another perspective? 
- Must might we missing? 
- Is that the only viable answer? 
- What does tht make possible? 
- All spaces of convertion more clear on what that space is so people can get into the right sapces that align with their resiliance... 
- Achieve both ends, and allow for cohesiveness... some willing to hang out for both... 
- MAGIC RATIO... 
    - BRINGING IN MANAGEMENT PARTS
    - THEN MOVEING INTO GENERATION / FLOW... 
- Flow of funds is a big monster that keeps people stuck...
