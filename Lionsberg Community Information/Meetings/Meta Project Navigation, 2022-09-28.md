## Estonia Updates

- Tightly connected people due to small population - 1.3M NATO nation state with size of San Diego city
- University and ecosystem for capital - Estonian Business School
- Tightly aligned and connected ecosystems - Graeme Boyd
- Member of parliament, former minister interested in similar approach, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Institute, Foresight planning institute
- People learning to collaborate better across systems - what are the inner changes for a person to participate
- Doing a pilot across these ecosystems - possibly local level, possibly national level
- Who might be engaged? versus what is already going
- Prototype - that could be replicated throughout the world
    - Both Strategic / 2035 transformation 
    - business and funding ecosystems
    - Interpersonal / consciousness / relationship work
        - Practice of discernment / emergence... 
        - Leader to faster / short cut solutions... 
    - Concrete projects that could be replicated / prototypes... 
- Strong background in research for Estonia 2035 for specific changes - would be hard to replicate - connect these up
- AI and robotics hubs across Europe
    - Estonian Parliament funded their own one first so are further ahead
- Conversations following trip - Forrist 
    - Ripeness potential that changes over time... 
    - What is the low hanging fruit that we can open up excitement, make connections, short term wins, ability to demonstrate success, tell stories, etc... 
    - Recognition that what worked earlier (digital adoption) may not continue to work if resources are low

## UN 

- Big question - connecting the network of networks
- Program governance - sharing information and resources across the groups
- Females and space organisations - STEM and greater participation of women
- Stewardships represented by SDGs does not include space
- Getting space organisations going for developing countries
- Woven in to this web3 and tech

## Resources

- "releasing emotional addiction"
- [Green Turn - Accelerate Estonia](https://accelerateestonia.ee/green-turn/)
- [AIRE – AI & Robotics Estonia](https://aire-edih.eu/en/)
- [Cynefin framework \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) - complicated, complex, chaotic, and confusion

- [Metacurrency](https://www.artbrock.com/metacurrency)

## Personal impacts

- sense of let down after excitement - Killu
- being in own mother country - different way of being - more happens when the re-experience of this has strengthened current way of being to be more effective
- Engaging in dialogue and conversation in a deeper way of being - Being on foreign soil shakes you out of where you came from - Jordan
- Have to be present as you cross those cultural barriers

## Common issues

- Legal and governance around funds
- How do we work together
- Integrity is key
- Protecting integrity of the pattern langauge... 
- Dialogical process for engagement
- Solutions as a stack - the key pieces prepared

## Issues
- Migration is becoming a big issue... 
    - Many siloed efforts... 
- Disaster and crisis recovery... 
- Interactions between a number of changes eg politics leading to environmental issues and people moving between locations
- Deploying rapid systems - to deal with food, sanitation, etc. that is missing infrastructure at most levels... 
- Spending time together -  in a way which is fun but meaningful
    - doing something practical or 
    - just hanging out

## Prototypes
- The total stack of solutions... 
- Lists exist - George - Forrist - Jordan - be collated and in a format for constant update - a wiki?

## Safe to fail experiments
- practice on smaller project we learn from
- keep the energy up over the week on what is happening
- fractal patterns - how to keep a smaller pattern integrated and workable

## Challenges
- how we contemplate, organize, and manage the explosive dynamic that is ocurring
- System for dealing with information flows from so many different levels... 
- Massive dendritic process... 
- Direct and indirect resources to deploy
- Need both information AND trust
- Wisdom and action with analysis and decisions - Judy

## NEEDS
- Clarity on what Lionsberg / Meta Project is... 
    - Can't do much until we know what Lionsberg and Meta Project is
    - Avoid rushing to define something that is still emerging... 
    - Emergence is a science which is improved by practical activity
    - How to move down into practical work... Do some very specific project things - that are in the forward path - and aren't developing meta project of years from now. 
    - We are tending to overbuild because we don't have enough concrete needs driving it...
    - open loops in definition of what we need create a frothy environment - for people to start building... 
    - Vs. starting super minimum... and then letting needs driven... 
    - What we need for this week, next week, week after that. 
- Quarterly meeting next week 3 yr / 1 yr /1 quarterly clarity... 
- Immediate measurable things to execute on - that we can track and present as value creation. 
- Need a language for identifying the domain that each things is coming from... 
    - balance between program management and complex adaptive systems transformation management. 
- Theory of Change
    - What type of change is possible in each domain 
    - Caution of treating everything as if it has same properties... 
    - Double down on getting languges of complicated, complex, clear, chaotic - recognize what can't be treated with same recipe, recognize what needs long term acupuncture... 
    - Rules of Engagement - to guide / provide guardrails through emergence. 
- Proposed Solution 
    - Taxonomy of problem solving
    - Tools sets to solve 
    - Wendy and Jason to give an opening presentation. 
    - How to link energy in a system - so you can see how things are flowing through different categories and parts of the sytem... 
- We don't spend enough time hanging out - can feel frustrating to not know what is going on for a week... two kinds
    - Kind of just hanging out, learning about each other, 
    - Finding a task that needs a few pairs of hands and confronting challenges together, arguing about how to do it, congratulating each other when we have x accomplished... 
    - Can be fun hanging out and working on meaningful things together - we spent 4 hours together and look at what we have accomplished... 
- How can we model what we need to see in the world...? 
    - A lot of us can see how colalboration is what everyone wants... 
    - directories... 
    - knowledge networks... 
    - and we struggle to do that just from people in this room... 
    - Picking experiments to run through... slicing off something, focusing on it, and practicing with it - freedom and abundance of practicing on something if we fail... 
- Too many threads are going frayed... and the energy of individuals in between meetings - dissipates too much - not enough cross communication between us... not enough focused attention to help us pick prioroiteis... 
- no group to go to to get feedback...
- therefore we need governance right in this room first... 
- so that as we add on decentralized pieces and more of them, they are not strugglng with same thing we are focused on... 
- MUST CREATE THE BACKBONE TO ALIGN TO... 
    - The connections... 
    - what will motivate us to keep going isthat we love each other, are here for each other, have each other's back 
- How to create clarity of vision... and milestones... so that 
    - Jordan is the only feecback loop 
    - Need core group so there is regular movement and feedback... 
    - So much waiting right in the wings, if we draw it in at right time... energy will disspiate 
    - Core backbone to provdie rhytm, milestone of inviting right pieces in at right time... so pieces are not just sitting... 
- We are drawn to make contributions to the many problems... 
    - and would be impossible for a group our size to address
    - wtihout shared ways of communication... 
    - or things will seem to be competing - when they are really moving... 
    - there is a process of communication... 
    - I need more communication not less... 
- How to create feedback loops is key also in my experience, as it impacts energy and how we work with it. If we are to become ever more skilled at engaging with each other and reality in active present productive ways, we need loops to cycle not ends to drop. But I don't know how to do this - have been thinking of it - yet it is likely very much solvable between us by agreement and decision.
- How to interface with agencies and major institutions... 
- How do I really help? Otherwise I will get frustrated or overwhelmed... 
    - How do we do the right kind of dendritic expansion
    - that builds knowledge and allows learnings to be shared in very diverse environments... 
- Pete
    - 'm going to say we don't have the structure yet for implementing feedback *loops*, because we haven't been setting small achievable goals (in a project plan / project proposal).  feedback needs to be in relationship to a goal.
    - TY Pete. Also feedback loops between ideas and energies shared between people, as energy is held, cycled and increased in these loops as they go between people. And then poured into projects, creating more concrete feedback loops based on project results.
- Bucket - to turn it into a deliverable that can be used by others... 
- USDA - whole ecosystem launched with $2.8B 
    - With a lot of colleagues that are adjacent to it... 
    - what does it take to appropraitely and realistically connect before partnerships stabilize 
    - Window of opportunity... 
- Since we don't have a methodology of TRACKING ENERGY - we are trading the energy of love.
    - Transparency to udnerstand what are energy flows
    - networks and pattenrs of energy flows... 
- As an aside, we have various information systems to hold directories and profiles, etc. they may be good enough, they may not, we'll see.  but the blocker right now is that we haven't decided yet as a group to *use* them. that's what we'd have to work on next, if we want them to be used.
    - Possibly one of top 3 quarterly goals
    - value of keeping track is much closer to healthy ecosystem... 
- Michael 
    - Our experiment might be simply describing both the metaproject and our relationship(S) to it. What are the roles of Lionsberg, PlatetaryCare, OpenImpact, Massive Wiki, WINfinity, Catalist, FutureCapital, The UN, etc….? Not to mention other entities that unkown to us, but contributing already.
    - Michael, I like the general idea, but it seems too meta and not "productive" enough.  Maybe I'm wrong (maybe I'm not), but a way to think through the question is thinking through, "who is the customer for those descriptions?" and "if they have those descriptions, how is their world better for it?"
- Jason 
    - Thinking of the long arc of City States - dozens of occupations over thousands of years... ability to hold a space, hold a culutre, hold an aspiration... 
    - Standard data structues for Local Community data hubs... fractally... how we learn... 
    - Struggling with - understanding and testing governance structures... 
    - Kind of understand how to create local ecosystems... 
    - Engage local businesses 
    - How we create infrastructure or governance that enables people working in generative community to work for it... 
- Wendy - [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) retreat in August was exactly on this topic
    - Wendy could invite in that 30 member community of practice... 
    - look critically... 
    - What are the flourishes that could be added... 
    - based on existing projects... 
    - Dave might be for it too... 
    - SCHEDULE MEETING... 
    - TRANSCRIPTS ARE AN IMPORTANT INPUT - GOLD THERE... 
-  - Jason - Mondragon model
- Governance and decision making... 
- What If... 
    - we find highly aligned way of building mroe aligned eocsystems where all stakeholders benefitting from all capitals created... 
    - Big picture - Estonia smlal country - 1.3M people - if you could activate... GDP only $36B... get people to build a bigger pie together... can also dividend the benefits of a greater pie... 
        - Activation of people 
        - Understanding the value of creating something better for joint benefit
        - as well as training in how to do that... 
        - Engine for value creation 
        - Structure to share it across all stakehodlers... 
        - Is the potential future vision with an activated population... 
        - Systems, processes, tangible things... 
        - as well as people - and ability to access collective knowledge that is teachable... 
- Michael
    - the customers for “1” (the movement) are orgs and individuals who see themselves as part of it. A generalized “are we on the same page?”
    - The customers for “2” (the participating entities) are individuals who might be more likely to participate in the specific actions of sovereigns when they know that those sovereigns are part of the larger movement
- I see the need, I wonder how I can help, or I harden myself to it... 
- Calls for concerted action in systems. 
- Forrist 
    - process to start experimenting with to choose where energy flow is to go... 
    - even simple point system... 
    - there will come a point there is a bucket of funds.. will always be inadequate to fulfill the universal desires... so we will be forced to develop the SKILL to Navigate and Prioritize... 
    - working together to determine and allocate... 
    - Co-Budget - designed for this... to allow groups to allcoate resources... 
- Forrist
    - Someone that can work with Jordan - and through simple conversation and editing... psulate different components... 
    - Going into a Lionsberg YouTube channel... 
    - so people can catch up when attracted... 
    - 
- Might be helpful to talk about the dynamics and specifics of change.  Type, process, goal(s), measurement, results /measure, learnings, what worked &N why, challenges/mistakes, etc.If we could template this in some way wed be better able to determine next steps. 
- The participants are not “run” from on high by the Environmental Movement, they support it, power it, and respond to its values.
- Issue
    - do we want to find ways to convert love into fiat? 
    - Is there a way we can value and pay for that? 
    - If we can investigate how to nurture love... and its manfiestations into action... and a 
- Pete
    - we are doing too much work individually, and not enough work together... 
    - pretending we are working together when we are working individually is a conflict - it is a wish we are not fulfilling - and it makes everyone sad.
    - some day we will be working together on stuff... 
    - Example - OFC Summit - I would love for us to knowck it out of the park, have a beautiful presentation... having me do it by myself helps mature my participation and leaves the rest of us out... 
    - Will create a big imbalance in where we are... we are caught int this bind.. .want to work together... and we are just not... 
    - if and when we are going to be productive... 
    - ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SLOW DOWN AND DO THINGS TOGETHER ARE UNCOMFORTABLE ... 
    - SLOW IS SMOOTH, SMOOTH IS FAST... have to slow down and work together to go smoothly, then we can proceed wiht alacrity... 
- Forrsit - +1 WM & Winfinity - key being adoption process and experience. Wonderful that it is coming via an internal team members. do we have a proposal, clarifying questions, consent vote process?
- unless we are willing to have our hearts comopletely broken - cannot fully EMBODY LOVE... 
    - go deeper, recognize, use, and abide in that... 
    - heartbreak...
    - waht are the practicalities... 
- False start feeling... what is working alone... what is working together... stems from lack of definition... between... how our individual parts and separate efforst and those of people not in the room fit into the movement... and the difference between this movement and lionsberg... 
- Pete - regarding currency, tracing energy flows, etc., i note that the purpose of those kinds of things are governance  i think we actually need some simple governance (as Wendy M. said, "we need a structure, we need governance right in this room"), even before we get to economically-oriented allocation and governance.
- Forrist - +1 Pete - strong agree. and then this needs to address who has standing, what does it mean to be a member of ? lionsberg, MetaProject something else?
- When we meet - what are we members and consultants and contributors to? 
- Agreed, Forrist, and I think there's a step before *that*, even -- we who are on this call obviously want to be here, and want to work together, even without understanding who has standing, whether or what we're a member of, etc.  So I think we can defer most of that for the nonce, and just talk about "what will we do together in the next few weeks?" (or, decide that we *won't* do projects together yet.)
- +1 pete, regarding currency, here is a wonderful progressive expansive new definition: https://www.artbrock.com/metacurrency
- Judy - we have to be reasoned and concrete about what we can do... or will devolve into frustration... 
    - Every one of us wants to help... 
    - hard to know what each person could do... 
    - or even if we had a legion behind us... 
    - I would invite each person to think about
        - who could i help
        - what could I do 
        - how would I know if I was successful 
        - What things we can reasonably do now and how many more millions would 
-         - What things we can reasonably do now and how many more millions would 
-         To add to Judy's comment - AND, we COULD also practice "becoming of one mind", phrase used yesterday by Gil in reference to "Braiding Sweetgrass" about holding meetings between different stakeholders in indigenous context where they engaged in a scripted specific process that got them there (around gratitude). We could practice doing those types of things, where we all join the field in ways we have spoken before, vs speaking from where we are at, but not in "one mind". Both have value, but feel different and lead to different potential outcomes.
- What are the Really good questions?
