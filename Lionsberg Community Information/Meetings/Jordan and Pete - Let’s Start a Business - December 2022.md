# Jordan and Pete - Let's Start a Business - December 2022

## Let's Start a Business 
- Need - more and more groups... more and more zoom calls... more and more need for post-processing, posting, and even potentially sense making of what is happening... 


## Ideas
- Value Points
    - You don't have to do the annoying work you dont want to do
    - Connecting to the right platforms over time (optional) - perhpas Catalist / OI - Lionsberg / Massive - leads to more technologies... 
        - Extracting chats 
        - extracting links 
    - Maybe develop a hash tagging system 
    - Maybe hash tagging system could lead to video people extracting out interesting 2 to 5 minute segments 
    - maybe not only do you get your own great presentation... but ALSO - get sense making of what is alive across all the (clients)
    - Handoff to social media / marketing teams.. 
    - ChatGPT summaries of the meeting transcripts... 
- Set up your zoom workflow for good:
    - scheduling
    - video, audio, and transcript recording
    - archiving
    - sensemaking
- "Bloomerang" / email system template
- Wendy / Pete / Co - transcript and story sensemaking 
- Tie out to revenue generation 
- Lionsberg Ecosystem Approach 
    - Member groups (who are paying monthly dues in the form of donations) - receive discounts... and a different level of access to what's happening across the network
    - vs. non member groups / companies etc. who could just be paying clients of the basic service.. 
- Long term storage of perhaps multiple copies in case a service like YouTube decides to freeze the account... 
- Business One, "Meeting Asset Archiving" - how to set up different kinds of meetings, better scheduling, managing recordings, automating getting them out into long term archiving, youtube, snippets onto various platforms 
- Business Two, "Conversation Curation" - continuing a conversation, not just capturing meeting by meeting, and tease out a narrative over a series of meetings, turning that into interactions with your audience, partners, public facing websites
- Business Three - Marketing and social media... 
- Graphic facilitation ala what someone like Matt Saiia team might do...

## What Pete Needs
1. Startup funding (but may self-fund)
2. Customers
    - early, lead customers that help define service offerings
    - peer member customers
    - later customers looking for commercial service and service level guarantees 
3. Marketing to progressively larger orgs over tiime 
4. Clarity on how the business feeds into and benefits from the Lionsberg ecosystem - hands and feet ops people, marketing people, billing and admin, 
5. Sharing value with member groups... 

## What Jordan Needs 
- Meeting Flow 
- Podcast / Interview Flow 
- Individual members 
- Lionsberg member orgs 

## Bootstrapping up a Federation 
- Responsiblity trust and faith 
    - Cooperating to cooperative agreements 
    - All cooperatives to federation 
    - Federation to all cooperative (if that is even a thing) 
- Agreements 
- Biz Dev / Partnership / Reciprocal Relationships
    - We have a lot of wrong intuitions about these things
    - Long term recirpocal relationships 
    - working together through hard times 
    - conflict resolution and conciliation 
    - We have specialized last couple hundred years... 
        - and some in cheating their side of that... 
        - causing people to forget... 
        - what it means to be cooperative and reciprocal rather than selfish and extractive...

## ACTION / NEXT STEPS

Timeline for Pete: off for holidays until ~Jan 4, first output for below around mid-January
Same for Jordan 

1. Create templates for plans above 
1. Complete templates 
1. Create short 1 to 5 pager 
1. Jordan and Pete can both distribute to their networks to get feedback and gauge demand 
1. Pete proposes a "Conversation Curation" guild / association with the people he knows who are doing that 
2. Look at configurations of various businesses, and how they partner and play 
3. Jordan proposes that we look at how to make sense of what is happening across the member orgs, and present that shared picture back out to the network at some regular interval... 
4. Jordan proposes we consider how this can tie to another potential function / "business", which is creating the supermind that can be pinged by (select members of the network) for timely and relevant info based on what is happening internally and externally 
5. Maybe this starts to feed the basic "RFG FLOW" back and forth 
6. Create a little case study (super light) that looks at these specifics
7. Strategy and Plan for ramping up over next 6 months into a funding stream... 



6. Separation for 1. member / partners (in the business), member / 2. partners (in the federation), 3. outside the boundary (commercial inflow, and expenses outside) 
7.

- which leads us to Michael's hypothesis that inside any boundary, the community should use as much internal currency as possible, while setting the level of external /"hard" currency required to pay its external / hard costs. 
- doesn't have to be currency - can also be unmeasurable intangible recirpocal goodwill 
- without collapsing all internal relationships to currency
- month-by-month, agreement-by-agreement "knob" for ratio of hard external currency, internal currency, and internal intangible reciprocal value exchange
- people negotiate value exchange all the time - all these various intangible levels... 
    - Currency is inhuman
    - Do i feel taken advantage of and cheated, or love / value / patience with this person 

## Business Ideas
- Monthly minimum that includes certain number of credits?
- Fixed cost for setting stuff up

    - x hr setup & onboarding 
    - x charge? 
- Helping client setup and optimize their Zoom account etc.
    - How you schedule meetings 
    - account settings 
- Per meeting cost 
- Fractioning out the work into flows
