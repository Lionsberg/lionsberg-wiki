## Upgrading Lionsberg Wiki

- [Refreshing a wiki to MWB 2.X - Developer Wiki (Massive Wiki)](https://developer.massive.wiki/refreshing_a_wiki_to_mwb_2.x)
- What are we upgrading? 
- Why are we upgrading? 
- What are the problems solved and new capabilities? 
- 

We want to upgrade Massive Wiki Builder for Lionsberg Wiki from v1.7 to v2.0.  The enhancements include:

- better directory structure for MWB (Massive Wiki Builder) and MWT (Massive Wiki Themes) 
    - (a bit of a breaking change with the old directory structure) 
    - (allows for better favicon directory placement)
- client-side full-text stemming search

We will get extra functionality, and also stay up-to-date with the MWB dev team, so we can more easily continue to upgrade to the latest and greatest features.


## Images and Art and AI
- Availability of new AI tools that will chanage the way we do art and illustration. 
- Ecosystems, marketplaces, forums... 
- 

## Project Management 
- Pete would eventually like Lionsberg / meta project to do PM type stuff, build teams, etc...
- And - It's a big job that will eventually take other people doing the heavy lift... 
- Pete will have less energy to make sure it happens the way he thinks it should happen...

    - CTO stuff (Internet, databases, product dev)
    - Product Development management
        - art and science of understanding how to understand what needs to get built, and building things that work well
        - human-centered design
        - requirements management
- Project Management
- Images / Art / Illustration AI... 
    - Why? 
    - Imagery is important... 
    - There is a big shift happening... bigger than most waves... 
    - Similar waves with written material... 
    - Decades out - working very naturally with AI tools... augmenting 
    - natural language... guiding AI... 
    - Basic new wave is AI...
- 25 years ago
    - would have raced to market with $1M and community based around that... simple exit strategy... 
    - FB, Google, Etc. racing along
    - In 5 or 10 a bunch of rollups / consolidation, someone with 100k artists on a paltform will get cashed out...
- And that is not waht we want to do
- The Path Now
    - build community
    - grass rootsy
    - open sourcy
    - discussion forums 
    - markets, exchanges, 
    - lots of people helping each other move into a new world. 
    - The 10k or 100k people you can gather from the world, have high bandwidth conversations. 


## Decentralization
- some of us love the ideas of decentralization... 
- The concept is hard to describe, doesn't make sense, some of us are living in the future, can see it happening, doesn't make any sense to anyone else... 
- Hypothesis: Don't put so hard on the right ultimate way to do it. 
    - over past 6 to 8 weeks, the things that MP is coalescing towards is something that is too big, but people want to work together as part of a bigger thing... feels safer, more normal... 
    - Pretty sure - that the right thing to do is have a bunch of 6 to 12 people in self interested sovereigns... 
    - And Amazon rant... 
    - What we are missing is
        - is entrepreneurial spirit... 
        - many people don't have it... 
        - many people can't understand it... 
        - all you have to do is say I am doing this, do you want to follow me or not... 
        - back to educational system... 
    - Be a nursery, see initiative, start to nurture more... 

- Jordan said something... Pete responded
    - The 30% cooperation time won't feel like overhead... 
    - It will feel like empowerment... 
    - You can get so much done with your little 6 person team...
    - and if you spend the time to cooperate with the network... you will get so much farther faster... 

- People want to call what we are doing something, so we know where we are going together... 

- Example: AI Art Marketplaces and Communities 
    - We have art and illustration marketplaces already
    - The reason they might not be good enough - is that we have to deal with thousands of times more images, and more components of images that never existed before. 
    - The way to get an AI to make an image is to give it a [[Prompt]]. 
    - That [[Prompt]] never existed before, and is not a key part of making stuff... 
    - There is now a marketplace where you can go sell Prompts - as a new commodity. 
    - Failure - to do it too soon and too brittle... 
    - Even inside a Prompt - there are 2 or 3 parts.. 
        - one is the subject you want made into the image
        - Another is the sweeteners... descripters of how... 
        - These really belong separate... 
    - A lot more scope and scale
    - a lot mor efine grained compoenents
    - a lot more participants... in a massive range of capabilities... 
    - many making so much junk it clogs the filters... 
    - and there will still be 10 or 1000 times as many artists and illustrators, just using a different tool than their hands... 
    - 10s of thousands of times number of images to push through the system.. 
    - old bell curve very narrow, 
    - new one very wide
    - Used to be - that if an artist graduated from art school - tough to be bad... 
    - when you stretch that out to encompass millions of peoples - all of a sudden a lot of junk being made in the bottom of hte bell curve
    - wierd secondary and tertiary effects... 
        - Such as a bunch of crap into systems not built for it
        - so you get an allergy to it... because you can't / don't have time to find the GOLD / VALUE... 
    - The process of making an illustration for a magazine, fine art... 
        - used to be a small set of workflow people
        - art director
        - illustrators
        - touch up people
    - In the new world
        - Whole back end infrastructure
        - Prompt engineer who thinks in conceptual terms... 
        - Art director... 
        - Someone good at navigatin conceptual space with AI
        - AI will produce a bunch of images. 
        - people who upscale them, more resolution 
        - finishing people that polish the art 
        - stretches out the number of roles.. 
    - Metaphor of Digital Music
        - Stretch out the number of roles, but can sometimes compress it to one PERSON... 
        - can go to online marketplace... find a vocalist... 
        - online marketplace. people who just do production... take mixed music, and because they know about frequency ranges, filtering, like photography, can take a nice well composed piece and do post production to tweak saturdation, contrast - another art in itself... 
        - same with music
        - same with AI art. 
    - So you need marketplaces for all those kinds of things... 
    - Small images - that if you blow them up look bad... 
    - if you just make it bigger, get little wierd bugs you can't fix unless you are an artist... 
    - if would buy as fine art if I could blow it up... but can't... 
    - so you have to tke it to fine artist... and say I can now  explain it... 
    - can you paint it traditionally, in the same style, but at full resolution... 
    - In AI Art Marketplace
        - 3 or 4 order of magnitude more volume
        - collaborative ranking
        - need people to teach one another skills. 
        - Marketplaces for all components
        - marketplaces for skills 
        - Mentoring on tool use. 
        - Marketplaces for pieces of hte components... parts of prompts, then full prompts... 
        - marketplaces for various levels of art completeness
        - marketplaces for artists who can take decent rendering that wont work, and repaint it... 
- NFT marketplaces
    - Where we are up to is... they can't handle very much volume... the meta information is really sparse... 
    - if you came into marketplace and had all the meta data - they don't have a place to put the extra compoenets... 
    - Its not one marketplace, or 5, but an ecosystem of 20 or 40 markets all intertwined together... 
    - Art director for maganzie - established process - go to Getty Images - has spent countless millions and manhours... to find art... 
    - If out of melange of collaborators... 
    - They have, like sound cloud of spotify, spotify also has to figure out how to live in an environment... where 3 or 4 guys in a garage made an amazing album. 
- Also need community around it
- and interface to existing old school markets... 
- Then if you do it right, a bunch of the 10 hour mentor course for x... and let's have shares in a new artist cooperative, you teach x, and I'll give you y, with marketplaces there is trading, startup equity that you trade with as well as money...
