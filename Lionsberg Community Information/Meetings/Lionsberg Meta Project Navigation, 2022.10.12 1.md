## Discussion 
- Learning process, we are searching
- No amount of structure will fix the issue that is at base heart and spirit issue (of not working well together in greater society)
-Maybe set up basic systems of comm'n for awareness of priorities, needs, what each is doing, builds relationships openinng opportunities for deeper collabs over time
- "You're at risk of failing if fall in default program management mode"
- Too much structure too soon, not what's needed - what's needed is get more groups that are autonomous, driven from within - instead of PM, create basic system of minimal communication and awareness of what each group is doing.
- Communicate monthly min data, priorities, roadblocks, opportunities, listen and help by rest
- Collective mind/metamind/supermind group, chat channel - be able to communicate out to network of peers - among leaders - get help fast
- Just build the network of connected leaders already out there, moving, building system of collective intelligence already out there and moving.
- Collectively get a sense of what road blocks are in network, go ID resources, solutions, build then, organically, of solutions in response to needs we are listening to from sovereign autonomous groups already in motion. 
- Slow down, focus on communication, trust everything will organically emerge (Stefan)
- Pete: JS to spend time not on program management/default mode (creates bottlenecks by getting people to seek answers from him that he can't provide), prevents answers from organically emerging - instead be inspirational leader, find and connect others, stay hands off, let it emerge through communication and slowly building. Everything happening very fast.
- 

- Solutions and next steps organically emerging... 
- And how we watch that, and participate in it... 
- The set of practices... 
- Speaking into the space the complete invitation for solutions to organically emerge... 

- Issue - structure too soon creates bottlenecks without intending to... 

## Feedback from the group
- A lot of us haven't gotten out of the mode of wanting to control 
- Emergence is key - but often feels to unruly... 
- How we develop the language to steady ourselves, like a handrail.
- Understanding what it feels like to let go of control... 
- Oh wow, you could do x with y, ... to do that - you just have to allow it to emerge from the group... 
- Can't design our way into this... 
- The difference between theory of change, and change theory... 
- The minute we go to models that say it will happen in x way... we can get lost...  unless we are super observant of where it is working / serving well and not...
- WHAT ARE THE FRAMEWORKS FOR TRACKING?... 
- Much more efficient, effective, but uncomfortable way to advance... 
- The world is in all these phases, in different times and different places... 
- There is value in project management as well, just for different phases
- Trae - part of depth drawing me back... is the depth of work around the cycle of emergence... 
- Deploying skill - where needed as needed... 
- The willingness to be in the unknowing place, just explore... with purpose... in a way that informs emergence... 
- The teachable heart - is the basis of relationship...

- Invitation to a safe community... 
- Michael 
    - It seems obvious now - that with all this activity, all this energy... it is a big buzzing field full of people... and we are making a huddle, come up with plans... 
    - but we are not with everybody... 
    - looking ouward, exploring, making contacts and communications, listening... 
    - developing channels of communication
    - and allowing emergence from finding out needs and opportunities... 
    - Focus outward, exploratory... awareness... expanding... 
    - temptation to make a plan... for action we are going to take... and hope others come along... 
    - Vs. connecting / supporting / empowering efforts taht already exist... 
    - Someone is already doing everything... multiple people... pull together... build... without building... 
    - Others are doing much of this...hunt and gather where in the world there are pieces for critical gaps...
    - ( we learned us forming nascent teams didn't work, were not with self impelled leadership already working,..needed to go hrough that learning)
- Forrist 
    - Component of looking at communication... if you look think of it as genuinely how does nature work in mycelium... goes from plant - says I need this energy / resource / nutrient... communicates to intermediaries, then to mycelium, who has the network to go out, find the resource, and bring it back... 
    - Curiosity - no matter what if we stay in the space of curiosity and exploration we can ask any question
    - This is a learning process - and you are modeling what a learning organization is about... 
    - there is no apologies... regardless of what it looks like happening... 
    - Because we don't know what we don't know... we are getting a lot of learning out of this, which is critical... 
    - What are the early steps that are really needed to take this vision and description... that we can hold as manifesting... while looking at minimally viable demonstration of that... 
    - what does it take to pull of a minimum viable demonstation... 
    - the selection... how that comes together... 
    - How to create feedback loops
    - clarity around individuals, what they are thinking... wind tunneling... Wendy E... 
    - and clarity about what are solution tools we can pull from and why... 
    - clarity around how resourcing would be determined... 
    - what is the governance model, how will it work over critical resources to be allocated... 
    - Co budget and together better merged - getting more traction and funding... (Webinar)... 
        - can also be used for allocating time towards projects - supporting agency for time and $ allocations... 
    - How much work it takes to lift engagement up... 20-30% often, 50% outstanding engagement... 
- strategic use of redundancy. 
- Open up. Reach outward. (Mycelium!) Explore. Gain (draw) awareness of the other existing aligned people and orgs. Listen intently. Develop communication (prioritizing participation in existing channels). Share comforts and discomforts. Learn needs, offer support, feedback. etc. Join in existing efforts. Let the plans of action be emergent, happen organically.
- strategic use of redundancy. 
- Mapping the many organizations doing the many things... 
- There are hundreds of thousands of projects attempting to do things... most of whome are working on their corner of puzzle without talking to each other... 
- What a beautiful path to be on with all of us - to have recognized "this doesn't work" and stepped into "let's try this instead", after reflection and joint experience (sorry Jordan you got to not sleep for a week as part of this...). - What if our function is also going to be fluid and similarly emergent, and shifting in time in response to our living awareness?
- The balance and forrays - Between naive learner... and expert wisdom provider... experimenting... stepping forward... being able to step back... be curious... and learn...



## Minimum Viable Experiment / Product / Service... 
- Comms System 
    - Mapping
    - Groups writing out what they know... 
    - Conceptually, can we fill in the Metaproject (Lionsberg map/infographic) withOUT building, but rather, recognizing what exists and can be supported?
    - Build a map in action - mapping that is emergent - co-designed
    - Will be difficult to collect information from users about their need... 
        - often a gap between what they think they need, and what they actually need at different levels of analysis...
        - Forrist - Most orgs don’t have a good understanding of their needs… speaks to the need for… A solid needs assessment process
        - A systems view in the needs assessment specifically including the context of the situation, the relationships involved and what to the patterns suggest?
    - Understanding where critical gaps or opportunities exist for application of Wisdom...  
- Process for identifying and collecting Wisdom
- Process for helping other organizations assess their needs... 
- On holding back - between being naive learner and being an expert, in academic setting (being brave, toss another pebble in your world - changed what happened) - put an experiment out there - felt bad thought she had broken something but it was wildly successful, just not communicated back to her about (WE)-learn to not be expert
- Listening to instinct to step
- **OUR FUNCTION IS EMERGENT AS WELL**... 
- Value of airing out with others in adjacent modes
- Subgroup work - even with this little group, gifts and emergence among us valuable
- MVP of network of leaders - what data and communication platforms are there/(shld be there?), to make us aware of what each other is doing, as the map is emerging
- Allows network to become aware of itself
- Cross pollination - being open to things that might seem they may not quite fit in... 
- RRe

## Meeting and Commuications Cadence... 
- Killu - meet weekly, bring in what's alive, Jordan brings in what he sees and what is happening... and if we run across new people... 
- Forrist - like the weekly space - and invite consideration of different format - offering the opportunity for people to choose to to faciliate the meeting with what from their perspective is a useful investment of the time... 
- Forrist - Catalytic Conversations... 2 or 3 top leaders... 
- Put on YouTube, slice into 10 min segments, help find next wave of leaders and orgs...JS and FL to connect
- Extraordinary wisdom being captured in long form video, won't reach many people - with army of editors w AI tools cut, curate
- Army of editors... combined with AI tools emerging
- Catalytic convos can't be too tame, too wild - and need different sectors be in conversation
- Need to replicate some of these convos in shareable form but not fully interpret them (transcriptionists exist, WE knows some)
- 

## Communication System 
- Realtionships are key - and feedback on how relationships are tracking... 
    - Listening and Feedback 
- How to see what goes out in the communications, and the ripples that occur, and the feedback backwards and forwards the whole time...  
- Can't do feedback without closing the loops - good communication requires trusted feedback as part of having communication work, need to learn how it works
- We are currently not dong well with non-local asynchronous / written... 
    - Try to get right what happens between people... without the asynchronous? 
- Simple directories... 
    - a little about us, location, contact info, phone, email, social, etc. 
- Compilation of observed problems and solutions... sorted into categories... "another one of those"
- Ways to begin respository of epiphanies / enlightenment / positive suprise... 
- so that it becomes part of system knowledge... 
- Potentially a lot of the excerpts are stories that impart a learning and an understanding that allows one to hold on and remember the story... that is directing towards a theory... that is working well in practice... 
- Powerful stories - they hold in mind, share, and help people align around what they are doing... 
    - pattern integrity held together by stories... 
    - (kind of how the sacred books of various wisdom traditions work... )
    - Stories allow people to repeatedly come back to the same thing... and be transformed... 
- How you receive a story is where you are at - story is useful as long as it is shared in forms that allows person to form their own view vs having your story having to become their story - an art of sharing in a way that says "it's exactly this" - leave ability to receive story in their own way - take responsibility for my interpretation of what someone else shared.
- Observed problems and solutions to be shared with communities, to be accessible
- WE: this is how micronarrative and story works - what worked - what was surprising - what did not work

## Retrospective
- Glad to see that we can learn together and pivot towards what is best... a sign of health is the ability to see what is right or true and make an adjustment... life is about trajectories... we have lightened our inertia... 
- ...by connecting well and caring for one another...
- Transformative meeting... sharing of opportunities...
    - how does it work best to gather the shared community awareness of waht is occurring... if you don't check mattermost... get an alert someone mentioned you... miss an email... 
    - How we systematically develop those repositories...
- minimum system... 
    - for taking what happens in meeting... 
    - getting it into respository... 
    - Here are nuggets - don't need to listen to other 70% - key bullet points... 
    - Takes a skilled digestion and analysis of sorts that usually would come from team leader... 
    - Recognizing and hashtagging in teh moment... 
- If someone hadn't read the email or watched video of this meeting, they wouldn't know what happened and where we are now
- Can we get skilled at recognizing and hash tagging in moment when something significant occurs
- We skirted around issue - constant - repository, google sheet, being able to make sense... simply vs in ideal form...another silo vs established practice spreading organically- how movements organically spread, there is redundancy, you want it to exist, for people to meet you where you are-"not build it and they will come"
- https://ethical.net/ - possible model to learn from. 
- Hold what we want to do - step forward/step back - the only way to learn is do something together - we feel when it is/is not working, put language around it - awkward to measure but we should try anyway - trust is there. let's actually do it
- Work out the roughest possible way to get feedback about our relationships... 
- "Here's our minimum thing...oh didn't' work...but keep doing things, not just saying them as we are not doing them, just saying them"
- Propose Google sheet, everyone can add their data on it, just do it, easy w small group, learn from doing it. 
- Forrist - 
    - Head and shoulders - the challenge for an organization to see its needs well... 
    - the importance of engaging - to have some method of needs assessment - that really looks at the whole picture... and ecan be done efficiently... 
    - In a regenerative focused way... 
    - And turning the lens internally, applying it on our selves... 
-
