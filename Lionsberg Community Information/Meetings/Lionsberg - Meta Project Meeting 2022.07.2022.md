- Much from Stephen Cottler's work... merging 3 or 4 TED talks, resummarizing
- sleeping well
- eating well
- water
- excercise
- setting stage for flow via conditions, 
- Primarily about being FULLY PRESENT
- Deeply present. deeply listening. putting our full focus on something. 
- Flow is self-perpetuating because it brings about all 5 neuro chemicals in the brain that are pleasure motivated... 
- Jason Schulist - referenced key resource John Lenhart https://www.myflowcess.com that we can connect Wendy M with
- Getting out of our own way, inner critic dies, sympathetic nervous system resets... 
- sense of freedom... 
- Triggers - things that are the preconditions for flow... 
    - Checking agendas and egos at the door
    - close listening
    - familiarity and connection 
    - open comms
    - shared goals and risks
    - yes and - staying out of judgment 
    - play
    - autonomy and sense of control - choice about where we are going next 
- The constant sense of feedback... 
    - I know I am on the right track... 
    - Immediate feedback - critical component to staying in the now and being motivated... 
    - giving each other appreciation, correction, 
- Religion, spirituality, and flow are very similar
    - which is good - so we can approach challenges from mulitple directions, still using processes that can be described and named... 
- Jason - John Lenhart - 
    - held a series of conferences to explore building skill, generativity, how you facilitate flourishing using uniqueness... 
    - John Lenhard work on uniqueness, how that drives the way different people flow, different patterns of flow, patterns of flow disruption... 
    - How we push buttons that enable flow, instead of disrupt flow... 
- Quite often checking ego at door is the difficult part... 
    - Getting used to getting into a co-regulated space
    - if you can do that regularly and quickly... 
- Russ Ackoff? Dissolving problems - (dis)(solving) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_L._Ackoff
- There is a co-regulation - when you have looked after your self well enough, you can start to look at how to get in flow iwth others... 
- Pre-work can't be skipped... 
- Difficult with strangers - when somebody new comes in, doesn't have the background... 
- Clean Language
- You have to be willing to spend the time getting ready to co-regulate... 
- happens magically sometimes...
- and how do we plan and prepare... 
- can find "fake Flow" - drugs, alcohol... 
- vs. healthy experience that can be deliberately droopped into 
- 


## The Practice
- we will probably find there is a series of things we can do at the beginning of meetings
- prepare for the flow state 
- Ritual / Ceremony 
- Prepare for what we will experiene together
- co-regulation 
- specific methods and techniques to elicit 
- The value of cotnribution to other groups and people. 
- ask other groups - what is it you need? 
- They may not know... 
- see what is emerging... 
- one thing is what is emerges in our group 
- and - what emerges if we try to bring outside... through deep listening and discernment
- and bring even more intentionally into the world... 
    - what we are practically doing... and trying to do... 
    - we can create that value by articulating it... 
    - here has been our experience
    - here is what it looks like... 
- This is why, what, how we are doing - bringing it to a level we can relate to, build from... 
- Coming together in more concrete ways as we engage, and as we articulate / document / don't just leave in the ephemeral realm
- write, express, share, Progressively articulate and realize... 
- Flow - is positive as a langauge... things that are positive, and blanced, dynamic approach to how we can work together as a group, find your own rhythm, balance your own boundaries so you don't do too much or too little... 
- like it because it is so positive... 
- Words / pictures / images of the positive side of (it)
- A blade of grass in the dessert... 
- the kind of hope and positivity that goes to the deepest level... 
- Active Hope ... 
    - Looking at reality... facing it... what can we do now...
- Going to the depths, really understanding in its deepest structure and identity.. 
- Let's frame in positive way - always reaching to the positive place... 
- When you have a slightly lower mood state... because of uncertainty... makes you more alive to your senses... 
    - positive mindset  
    - What is possible is best question to ask... 
    - Senses more alive - take in more of environment and be present to it... 
    - Deep value in the uncertainty / the unknown... 
    - have to be that tiny bit out of control, all the time... 
    - Can feel negative potntially - 
    - but make that state of slight disarray your normal state - just enough disarray... 
    - One of preconditions of flow is NOT KNOWING
    - have to get comfortable with being UNCOMFORTABLE 
    - at just level of difficulty to survive that... 
    - Game of being uncomfortable with uncretainty... 
- Wendy E - Book recommendation - Beau Lotto - Deviate 

## Morgan Ideas
- Colocation - at least periodically 
- Live colalboration 
- Asynchronous reporting and communications - tech stack to faciliate 
- Iterative lanning cycles 
- Hierarchical multi-variate optimization 
    - to tunr into one another and objectives
- open project roles that play to individual strengths
- love born and consensus driven objective
- shared positive experiences
- genuine curiosity and relationships
- grounding shared vibration and intention 
- co-creative expression and feedback... 

## Jason
- goal, method, practice, coach + challenge you didn't think you could do but could
- requires coach to move you beyond your own capabilities... 
- which leads to dopamine and flow
- in toyota kata is a version of that methodology 
- Goal, challenge, set of iterative experiments, use a method, practice the method, and have a coach that allows you to do that... 
- almost everything is a skill - from hope, faith, positivity... 
    - as opposed to innate characteristics or reaction 
    - which you can change... 
- Create psychological safety in a system... 
- see this slide on how to build a skill - ![](https://i.imgur.com/cJJGaQ9.png)

## Wendy 
- How we can add to patterns previously discovered... 
- Carol Dweck - Groth Mindset 
- Character Strengths - 
- Actionable values... sense of control... 
- These conversations are finally the chance to merge these insights.. .into something technological and structural that can support people towards the emerge of their best selves... 
- Avert the crisis - about being curious about something coming towards me - listening with deep curiosoity... 
- Space of curiosity and wonder... 
- being comfortable with the unknown... 
- LEARNING EDGE - challenged just enough but not overwhelemed...
- see this diagram on the learning edge: ![](https://i.imgur.com/dlKQqb4.png)
 
- Heping each person ask their own learning edge - what they want to learn and how quickly - challenged by what is interesting each indivdiual... 

## Bill 
- Curiosity and Wonder 
- Flow requires some kind of common language, relationship, trust.. 
- Little children - may not have much equipment in area of language... but can still get in flow state... 
- Make eye contact, show interest, listen carefully, say one word about an object, say again and again... 
- Begin to see, understand, 
- So amazing to watch a child learn, and get drawn into their flow state of intensity, hunger, curiosity... 
- Listening carefully, attentive to what is happening... 
- Returning to a CHILD LIKE WONDER AND CURIOSITY... 
- creates a safe state... 
- Team painting - can add on, but can't chainge it completely 
    - like the yes and improv exercise... 
    - like improve - it is "our" painting...

- What is one's deepest fear, blockage, fear, - 

## Wendy
- something real important about physical things with physical people that doesn't need the words... 
- Do as many physical things as possible... 

## Michael 
- resonated with metaphor of duelpatining - and 
- struck by - the fact thatthere are so many of us... and individuals engaged in different things... 
- very hard to duel paint in this world of all of us trying to do good... 
- what are the ways we put our separate brushes to the same canvas... 
- Big tech, governments, political parties defencding things the way things are - 
- Dont have the standards, the shared economic agreements.. 

## Flow 
- feels good
- we want more 
- when we create the conditions 
- people want more 
- and seek it out in other places...
