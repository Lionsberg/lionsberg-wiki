## Retro - Start of New 6 Week Cycle 
- Sense - things are wobbly... 
- Opportunity to reflect and restructure
- one wobble - in the effort to create decentralization and autonomy... emphasis on the web that can hold the nodes together, ends up on entrepreneurial leadership style, that is not manifesting in every small circle or group... 
- so that instead of energy mounting and interconnections taking off... energy faded... 
- Hypothesis: maybe we need a little more leadership, clarity, structure until things need to get up and humming... 
    - Phases of leadership and governance
    - 2022 and 2024 - catalytic entrepreneurial leadership needed... 
    - 2024 to 2026 - maturing into Phase II
    - 2026 to 2028 - maturing into Phase III
    - 2028 to 2030 - maturing into Phase IV... 
    - by 2030 - there is a steady state network, operating in its full capacity / new state... 
- Wendy's Feedback 
    - Wobble
    - Energy is decreasing in the whole
    - Need for figuring out how to bring disparate pieces together... 
    - Learnings from Volunteer organizing
        - What motivates people to come together when they are not being paid? 
        - Often a lot of people come with an agenda (which is why they are involved) 
        - People feel even freer to walk away if unhappy - so you understand it sooner...(vs. if paid). 
        - What is needed - is people willing to LISTEN TO NEEDS... and ELEVATE ONE ANOTHER. 
        - People have a hard to time putting down their concept... 
        - Need the affirmation that the IDEA COUNTS... 
        - The human game of waiting for PERMISSION... or AFFIRMATION from AUTHORITY... 
        - We are acting as if... we wanted permission from an authority... 
        - "I am coming with a piece, not advocating solely for my piece, coming from open heart and right intentions"
        - Of all the things I could be spending time on... IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE AND TIME I COULD BE USING MY TIME AND ENERGY... 
        - If there is another project... sensing into the right [[Space]] and [[Time]] for me. 
    - People - totally willing to help... and if they feel it is not right space and time... 
        - People not knowing where to put my piece down. 
        - Onboarding... 
            - They can offboard just as fast.
            - A constant and ever moving ever evolving dynamic we need to find ways to find through... 
        - How can people dip a toe in, dive in, get a resource and leave... 
- Leadership
    - Some types of projects ready to go, just need marketing... 
    - Meta Project playing in the place of inception... 
    - Needs people who can think beyond, people with more entrepreneurial mindset... 
    - risk takers
    - funders, leaders, watching it cycle before it crystalizes... 
    - Some people want something to be very clear. 
    - Not clear what it is doing... 
    - Everyone knows what next step is... 
    - Some people - need a specific problem, direction, momentum forward in a specific project, compass... 
        - and then they can organize the team, budgets, contracts, etc. 
- We need rapid fire innovation and creativity on a level we haven't as humans been able to do before... 
    - A space many people are uncomfortable with
    - Many want to know the moment you are Ready to Fly. 

## Flow
- what the process looks like when we see an emergent idea... and need to advance a project from nothing to something... 
- once it is something... the world has that figured out... 
- How to coordinate action around something direly needed... and not crystal clear around that... 

## Zeek / Wendy / Vincent and Teams 
- Why does this group have some energy? 
- What is working? 
- What's Next? 
- Wendy
    - At core is two prongs
        - 1. I am always listening / asking variations on what is most alive for them... which goes back to the internal drive... 
            - What's most alive for them is the thing they most want to do about what they are passionate. 
            - something that drives them forward to want to take action
                - either life is already aligned... 
                - Or not
            - What is most alive... and what (pulling) - what they want to do about it... 
            - People want to be of service. 
        - 2. Looking for coalescing energies. 
            - Looking for the patterns in energy 
            - Some pattern comes from logic
            - AND - based on people's energy, interest, motivation - comes from who is interested in working on different thing... 
                - the pre-existing nodes of energy around which people are aligned. 
    - Meta Project is a (System / Process) on collaborative action
        - Prototypes and experiments 
        - Experiments are patterns of focus 
        - I.e. regenerative ag and economics and sub-focus... 
        - To galvanize energy, bringing the other components along, then allowing for horizontal expansion into other verticals. 
    - I am going to spend time reconnecting with 3 people, digging up an old paper, carving out time... 
    - People seeing and being alive with what their next steps are... impelled to the next thing... 
- 1:1's with Jordan seem to be motivating... 
    - How to connect Jordan's energy / drive / passion... with other emerging energy... 
- Process for people coming back later... 

## Wendy's Keys
- People will not ask for it... if we tell them where the patterning is that we are seeing... 
    - "Here is where the energy is currently growing"
    - Here is where people are coming together to do work and what people are focusing on
    - Here are needs being expressed that are not being met yet
    - The top issues and concerns the group is expressing... 
- Those topics will rise and fall, each have a lifecycle, often just serving the next pattern, not arising htemselves... 
    - Helping people understand something is bubbling just under the surface.. 
    - Then when things are happening, same thing but pattern is clearer... 
        - Here is what is happening
        - Here is what has been delivered
        - Repeating and telling stories so people can see energy, get excited, add something, make an intro, also opens a door to someone stepping forward... 
        - Stories moving into Calls to action... 
- Finding the places the energy is moving the best... 
    - Getting governance set right... 

Here is what is happening, here is what our meetings have spawned, here is what was generated... 
- Now these other things are happening, and maybe we will find the need to come back together - now go out... 
- Helping people play... 
- Not getting overcommitted to any one thing... 
- Still feel they are serving the whole... 


What how do we create the boundaries in which that play can manifest itself across time... 
- The idea of making sure how funding is structured, funding projects, the ecosystem around that piece alone, 
- key to the next steps we take
- how we trust collaborating
- all the work we put in in a space that feels vulernability
- chaos... finally patterning... something crystalizes... then 3 people run away with it... 
- repeating story that needs addressing before people feel comfortable really collaborating and sharing... 

Hesitation: 
- How to filter 
- Ho

## Framing
- Framing things as they are presented, so the framing of people's minds is oriented towards the New so it is received in the way it is intended. 
- Be wise in framing so it is received in the way it is intended. 
    - It is a piece. 
    - it is an option. 
    - It is in development. 

What Wendy and Marianne are going to work on... 
Or Wendy / Zeke / Vincent project. 

1. Once the pattern is recognized
2. and there is enough for there to be a focus
3. Identify it to the group - this is an area of focus, who wants to work on it. 
4. Period of research - what is already out there, deeper dives, networking, come up with short white paper / presentation. 
5. Where experts speak to the topic, expresses what is, and intention / vision... Resourcing needs... 
6. Community takes that - any groups, orgs, individuals who want to contribute next steps, help that project or focus advance in any way... 
    7. has a couple weeks to talk, understand, bring it back, bring answers, solutions, insights, added network back... 
8. meta project then organizes a cohensive answer / proposal... 
    9. that includes what resources, funding, expertise, policies, etc. are needed... 

1. Intention / Vision 
2. Analysis
3. Engagement 
4. Planning - white paper, moving towards full plan of action 
5. Action 
6. Continuous Improvement 

UN SDGs... 

Issue: Words / Names / Abstract / Concrete / Brand... 

The idea of separating Meta Project from Lionsberg has a fatal flaw... 
- Because we need to be able to make decisions, write checks, etc. 

Closing Thoughts - Wendy 

- Need more detail on how I see the relationship of Meta Project and Lionsberg... 
- Understanding the interrelationship is really important. 
- What is the rippling / new patterning we want to create, and how do we craft that... 
- Experiment - we are going to start running a process. 
    - Transparency and Collaborative Decision Making 
    - If we say this is our focus for the next week - people will rally to help get through the steps...
    - Things to provide examples of patterning and practice
