# Lionsberg, 2022.11.02

## Trips Away
- Pilgrimage... doing something different... transforms how you see the world and think about it... 
- Wendy - common in Australia - always people different... out of the box at the beginning... something they did that was against the rules... so if you say leaving what you Should be doing is against the rules... 
- then australians have always done this... 
- ON eastern front in WWI - something completely out of the box... 
- Making a bet... long odds... uncertainty... vs. just doing business as usual... 
- never been real rule followers... maybe will do it for a period of time, but there is a cost... 
- Sporting personality.. playing... resiliance... have a go... engaging with whatever comes... 
- IN flat world - don't see what is going on... easier to make mistakes... 
- there are so many cues... interpersonal energy transfer.. physicists have determined that we emit and receive signal energy from other living creatues... not just noise of the crowd, but energetics imposed from other people... fluid dynamics... 
- Rhythm... cadence... 
- there is physiologically a reason.. heartbeat, clapping, rhythm, women together... found that this rhythm actually exists... people's flocking... into pattern... hearthbeat, other types of rhythm...
- Reminds me of lean "takt" which is fundamental to pull planning 
- more to "vibe" than just what meets the eye... 
- medical director and social science person at Canyon Ranch... 
- accounts for differences between how you interact on Zoom and in person... 
- a lot more we are responsing to on a truly subliminal level... vs on screen... 
- Phermones and other bits and pieces... 
- Meta project - needs to account that we on't have those clues... 
- but we could get there in another way... 

## Jordan

- find up to 3-20 sovereign autonomous groups
    - assume groups of average size of 7
    - waiting list if more
    - circulate to find if more
    
- maths of build to coordination 
    - a billion groups Fibonacci sequence 62% per cycle 
    - 7 years aiming point 
    - loss rate 20% groups fall off per cycle 
    - 8 months of float to 2030 - exponential halves this

## Growth narrative
- in relationship
- get to know one another
- then trust
- small scale cooperation
- broader cooperation
- Use Lionsberg development to date as a starting point

## Judy
- How to balance for myself personally and others - theexpansion potential, the enablement of the expansion, and what is needed... in terms of what we can provide to support the expanded impact... 
- how to generate the materials to share... 


## Jordan
- assumption of the groups will provide some of their resources that exist
    - needs reciprocal flow of energy / funds
    - they extend to others


## Pete 
- What are we asking the groups to do... 
- The thought experiment of how it might scale is bullshit... when stuff happens it is different... 
- Early in career - lots of itme on mathematical models nad growth- and after that - got it that we can model to convince yoruself you have a shot... 
- and - we know that the models completely miss the point - either a lot slower, a lot faster, or most particularly run into situations we cannot guess... 
- so I learned after 5 times... do a rough thumbnail sketch of wehre we are going... that it feels okish... then figure out immediate near term... what are we doing in 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and how do we trim tab those... 
- and how do we add the rocket fuel to whatever we got... not worrying about how far rocket fuelPete is going to get you, but how we structure this set of people and next tranche or two to bootstrap into next phase, then next phase... getting into each phase and not falling over... 

## Discussion 
- I like the discussion of getting started and learning from that... 
- first steps teach us... 
- we learn... what people will do when they join... 
- just take a step, see where we are at, and decide onthe next step... 
- Combination
    - setting expectations, but open ones
    - Getting feedback rapidly
    - people's expectations and resources fairly stretched... 
    - shared enough to say it looks like x... and then get feedback from teh beginning... 
    - We fail
        - around different expectations... 
    - Short / quick / iterations...
- Living things don't grow themselves without certain elements... 
    - basic life force and energy
    - built around DNA pattern that is very clear... 
    - and all the essential resources and ingredients for life... 
    - People are even more complex, don't grow communities unless they know and trust each other... 
    - "How do we know that your way is worth us putting any time into"
    - Wont joint unless there is an example / prototype, and it shows people can understand and trust... 
    - and wont embrace something that requires a significant change... 
    - If joining takes a lot of time, all those people would not joy... 
- Answer the WHY would somebody join... 
- And WHY is this attractive.
- Observers have to understand the idea... and believe it is the best hope for them to meet their ends... 
- Many groups of all kinds, religious, political, environment, fraternal, and saying join us... so WHY? 
- Proper plans... 
- Proper capitalization... 
- A product or service - they really need - that actually makes "my" life better... 
- In a way that accmplishes something of value for me and the world... 
- Building something so beautiful, that is so amazing.. how did you do that... 
- Judy - I am particularly concerned that as we reach out to groups, we don't disappoint them... feel sad if we try to do this, and go out ambitiously, not able to meet anticipated or hope for needs, and leave them disenergized or feeling sad... 

## Pete 
- Delivery against expectations is critical... 
- Experience of both disappointing and delighting people... 
- Distinction between kinds of planning
    - one kind is top line physical possiblity growth... 
    - We cannot predict that far in advance... 
    - And - we have to look in the mirror - is the thing you are proposing physically possible, and you have painted your self into a corner... 
    - Am I talking about physical possiblity, or am I insane... 
    - Critical to do... as much as we need to... to prove it is possible... 
    - And a completely diffrent kind of thing... 
        - which is things we do this week, next week, and three months that we can promise to a "customer" 
        - has almost nothing to do with top line prediction stuff... 
- The top line is a distraction 
- thing that is really important... 
    - so what are we going to tell people we can do... 

## The Invitation
- We are not promising (Utopia)... 
- We can move forward by putting one foot in front of the other... and the way you do that... 
    - is that you underpromise and you over deliver... 
    - so the small thing I can give you is this stuff... 
    - not talk about how many people in 18 months - doesn't matter in the moment, and we don't know... 
- At some point, a very few number of months out - the only people you want to talk about forecasts with are specialists... 
    - who are steeped in the science of playing with numbers that may or may not happen... 

## Gil 
- Dwight Eisenhower - there are no plans, there is only planning... 
- it is an orientation to the world... 
- to understand the dynamics and sensitivities of the game I am getting into... 
- How are the things wired... 
- We are doing something much less defined, and much more emergent... 
- Make an offer so compeeling that peopel want to play... 

## How We Meet 
- Example: Quaker meeting... 
- A lot of it is about slowing down, and changing the normal process of the way we work together. 
- It is really common in our society for peole to push, shove, try to get ahead... 
- Jump into unhealthy dynamics of power, hierarchy, churn, and moving fast... 
- Takes away opportunity to think about things, ... 
- a lot of it might be silent... 
- people speak when they are called to... about what they are called to speak about... 
- "This is what I hear or perceive"  
- Instead of reacting to that... go back into silence for some minutes and reflect on that... 
- Maybe it is magic space, maybe neurophysiological space... 
- Instead of stimulus and immediate reaction... we want to slow that process down... let noise filter out... and look for really imporant signalll
- escapting Dopamine cycles... 
- filtering for the weak signals that are super important... 
- thing you want to resonate is not hte immediate signal, but hte important one in the background... 
- Pete
- quaker meetings 
	- slowing donw
	- not pushing ahead
	- what she was said was wrong / right 
	- jump into dynamics of fast
	- we are trained and excited by this 
	- fellowship - can be silent
	- testifying for the room
	- called to speak about - then silence and reflect on that
	- neurophysiology of that
	- instead of a dopamine hit - let this flow away and then look for the weak signal
	- look for the weak and important signal
	- resonance created 
	- the resonance cascades
	- can aggregate thisj
- Wendy M
    - I felt called to be outside and in a creative endeavor - because it helps me listen deeply 
    - science of flow and flow states... 
    - Video I like the most is by Stephen Cotler? and Flow Genome Project website... 
        - "How to get into the flow state 2019" - 
        - https://www.flowgenomeproject.com/
        - https://www.youtube.com/c/FlowGenomeProjectTV/videos
    - Magic that gets created when we listen to one another... 
    - How we get there in different degrees of progression
    - putting self and agendas aside while we listen to what is between... 
    - Flow is a great state for peple innovating /creating... 
    - Theta wave... quiet critics in mind and each other.. .make cross associations not available to us when in daily lives
    - cuts learning time, makes things feel easy, falling into place in front of you... 
    - right people into right room at right time... 
    - people need to be at simialr learning edge... 
    - stretching towards something, not overwhelmed, or bored and not listening... 
    - group flow is leading edge... of research and experience... 
    - Understanding and creating the conditions... to set the soil from which the growth can emerge... 
    - Feedback loops also contribute to flow... 
    - cylces of communication where people can bring information to a group and get feedback on it... 
    - iterative improvement... 
    - feedback has to happen for learning and growth to continue... 
    - There is a hole in the network of rapid innovation and creativity towards the things we need to be doing better, more consistently, on larger scales... 
    - Getting into learning, applying and getting feedback from that application... 
    - in a way that creates engagement... and keeps us wanting to lean in... more engagement... more attraction... more energy... something different is happening... I need that.. how do i get involved... 
    - Flow state is addictive, and activates 5 positive neurochemicals... and we want to be there together... 
    - emerging things from that space that then applies and gets good feedback in the world... 
    - that becomes magnetic and draws people in... 
    - in a way that is positive and meaningful for them.. 
    - blessed with too many people trying to step forward... 
- Wendy E
    - Learning state has to be the constant state... 
    - Stephen Cotler's work - one of main books worth noting is how Flow crosses over to a Spiritual experience... which is a threat and an advantage.. 
    - many don't have that state of AWE
    - people crave that feeling... 
    - through religion
    - being in communion around something together
    - practical flow state you can live in once you understand entry point and what knocks you off it
    - cross over with spiritual element is critical - memory of that in something that is not necessarily religion but could be
    - same neurochemical thing in flow and religion
    - ambiguity of working at multiple levels, giving peole what htey haven't had
    - crosses over into physiology as well. 
    - can't get into Flow if some needs not met in your environment... 
    - helping peple get into flow... understanding substrates in environment.. 
        - Desert... 
        - water... 
        - food... 
        - shelter... 
        - energy... 
        - clothing... 
    - The total set of conditions that allows people to rise into collective flow... 
    - have to meet the Total Nested Hierarchy of Needs is critical... 
    - Flow is the best way forward... crosses boundaries... just being in their world can be a threat... bringing trust just enough... clean langauge... satisfy a NEED... 
        - to get to trust... 
        - through very physical entry points.. 
        - "What do you need"? 
        - Subtleties of entry points to flow
        - standing near you
        - have a religion that is not theirs 
        - have an opinion that is not theirs... 
        - noise
        - light
        - not enough water
        - giving something towards sustainance
            - noticing htem...
            - food 
            - water
            - shelter
            - energy
        - learning the subtle entry points to flow... 
        - Even asking for a few minutes of time is a threat... 
    - People who have made cross overs, changed belief sets, crossed ideological boundaries... 
- Judy
    - segmentation of how we go forward, with whom, in what way, to faciliate the learning curve, meet groups on thier space, not ours, ... 
    - skewed towards listening side... 
    - inviting questions... 
    - exploring partnership with a variety of options and implications... 
    - how we effectively apporach groups, listen, and offer what is of most value to them... 

## What is the OFFER, and what is the REQUEST we are making of people... 
- how we effectively apporach groups, listen, and offer what is of most value to them...
- Potential for maximize impact is to become far more customized, which is a human initiative... 
- itis a human factor that needs to be offered... 
- Flow is an invitation... 
- How might we listen deeply to other, who might have other styles of speaking and hearing, and offer what is of most value to them... 
- What is valuable to me?
Knowing about what others are doing in fields I am working in
Learning from them
Offering ideas of my own to (perhaps) enrich their practice
Exploring how all of our practice may fit together, to create a synthesis, and breakthroughs, and move society forward
- clean langauge
- being willing to speak out what is on my mind and spirit... 
- What we can grow and learn our way into together, not argue about... 
- here is wisdom in how we approach others to allow them to hear/listen/embrace, and for us to learn how we can offer assistance.
- For the types of challenge we face, we need full engagemnt of people - so that they can communicate wisdom and opportunity to their own circles and peopel they influence... 
- If we are conscious, not offer quick judgments of solutions to situations where we have less than full appreciation of complexities... 
- Agreements - 
    - Wendy suggsts we might need some kind of ritual... 
- Agreement to journey together and to resolve and celebrate together... 
- Awareness and communication
- leading to relatinship
- leading to synthesis
- to move society forward... 
- the intention to move forward together without specifics... 
- not knowing where the road leads but committing to the road... 
- dont know the specifics, but intuitively sense there may be something on teh road, so you commit to the road

## Discussion with Hank
- Sicily and Albania... 
- thinking a lot about civiliatons that come and go... 
- In obth well touristed Sicily and hardly touristed Albania - you come uon places of ancient importance that no one knows of... or maybe vaguely knows the name... 
- The City of King Phyrris... 
- What does it mean to have a civiliaton based on Books... moving to electronic formats... which at one time in the future might be eclipsed by wheatever is coming... 
- What we think is important will vanish - what does that mean to the work we all do? 
- we do the work, we know it may be iimportant now, or not, forgotten in 100 years or 1000 years or not... but we still are compelled to do the work. to drive to make a better world... 
- The Importance of Trajectory 
- Jordan asked Hank about needs. 
    - I may be one of older people on these calls... 75... trying to stil work 30 hrs a week on passion projects, and have time to devote to family, etc. investigating the world.. 
    - I am very practiced in generating ideas... 
    - I used to generate ideas, and find the clinet who would help me realize them... 
    - In last 15 or 20 years, hve shifted my perspectives on the world... can still generate new ideas, recycle old ideas that weren't at the right time
    - dont have the energy to work actively on them... 
    - I would lve to give ideas as inspirations to younger people to take and run with them, and every once in a while be asked a question, mentor, I ahve a lot of ideas I can evelop in conversations with friends in my ideas... that probably could be taken by other people, enriched... and put into practice ot see if they work... 
    - I am missing CONTACTS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENERGY, IDEAS, BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT TOGETHER... 
    - I AM GOOD AT SYNTHESIS... SEEING CONNECTIONS... WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOUNGER PEOPLE... 
    - take ideas, enrich, and put them into practice... 
    - GETTING GENERATIONS TOGETHER TO WORK... 80 YOs with 60 with 40 wtih 20s with teens and sub-teams... 
- Every generation makes a lot of mistakes... maybe a lot... 
- but if we are conscious at all... and do self reflection... we are a bit aware in our 70s of those mistakes... and would love to be able to set the world right in a way that inspires the gernations to work together... 
- 5 generational concept of society... 5 conscious generations co existing... each with different experiences and different ways of looking at the world... 
- none is complete in and of itself... if the 5 could get together in some way... the possiblity or something happening that could never arise without the generational cross pollination... 
- big problem in europe and asia ... 
- which is lack of POSITIVE IMAGES OF THE FUTURE... 
- climate anxiety
- stress about uncertainty
- bitterness about older people who made and broke promises... 
- only older peole some know are their relative and teachers... 
- if you are younger and anxious, last peole you might go to are parents and teachers... where can people find people of other generations they can relate to... 
- critical to health of scoeity... 
- to work on practical answers of hat... 
- Young people with young people, that might be hellped by older peole, who are are in need of learning from young people... 
- grandchlding and grandparenting beyond a kinship relationship... 
    - something i would like to experiment with... 
    - only way is to initiate real lived experience... 
    - are younger peole in need of grandparents? 
    - Old people in need of youth? 
- Internet filter bubbles can be shatted by cross generational multi-generational projects... 
- Real lived experience... 
    - any kind of prototypes... 
    - Everyone puts things into the black box... and it churns out different kinds of ideas... 
    - Teh more prototypes.. 
- Hank - Idea
    - I have a lot of working ideas... 
    - one called an urban infrastructure for hope... 
    - Amsterdam, Tokyo, Sweden, Copenhagen... all thinking in simialr ways... 
    - I have a dream of 4 to 6 prototypes running together... in 5 or 6 cities and cultures... and see if something we come up with unique to certain places... or generically unique to these times... 

- Gil suggested Jordan meet Tal Ronen in Israel...
