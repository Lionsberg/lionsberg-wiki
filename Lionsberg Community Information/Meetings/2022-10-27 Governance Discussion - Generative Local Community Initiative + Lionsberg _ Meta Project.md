## Ted
- President of Miller electric - source
- been working 1.5 years through this model... share, and discuss problem relating to governance
- Every individual born wtih a unique potential - acorn to oak tree 
    - genertically coded... that we can achieve
- The introduction of elements and condtiions determine whether it can flourish, or not... 
- WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS... rain, relationships, embodied learning, higher calling... 
- what are the conditions that need to be in palce for an individual to floruish
- Generativity - group of people or community flourishing together... not single acord ot oak but whole forest
- environmental conditions so people can flourish together. 
- idea of experiment to run around how we might build a generative local community in reality... 
- 5 things we know the world already knows how to do
- local organisations supporting local business
    - convert money into flourishing
        - 
        - organisations that do this already
        - take money and deliver conditions for a population 
        - Intellectual, spiritual, adn physical flourishing
    - local anchoring orgs supporting local business
        - Key instutions thgat are. local, local health, education, utilites, government, private business
            - each with own supply chain needs
            - can have big impact on economy by keeping those supply chain needs local... 
            - Vs. outsourcing to larger multinational corporation
    - creating local business network
        - idea of multiple - the sum being greater than the parts
        - synergies
        - By pulling local busiensses together under single banner, they can work together... 
        - GLC prototype - in Miluakee 
    - govern a network of businesses
        - If you are pulling together a network, how would they potentially be governeed
        - Mondragon
        - DAO. 
        - we know it is possible
        - Governance becomes the really focus when we have pitched... it is at heart of how the whole thing fworks... 
        - Mondragon as a story / prophesy / proof it is possible... 
    - social impact investors focus investment on root cause issues. 
        - working on root causes of issues
        - available capital to be investted in social and community development work
        - Complexity mindset and intercoonnected mindset on how we invest those dollars... 
- We are not focused on Issue 4
- What if we could connect these 5 things in a neighborhood system... if we did that... would that allow us to achieve or move towards GRC concept... 
    - Can you cash flow positive this network of businesses
    - incubator kitchen
    - laundromat
        - by day retail
        - evening commercial / industrial
    - fork to farms
    - restraurant
    - yoga center... 
    - primary reason is to create flourishing... but need cash flow... and nice to have community anchor organizations create more cash flow
- Expect cash flow positive ina way there is profit at the end - not for short term... but for long term... discerning how they convert extra resources into various forms of flourishing... 
    - Assume network is run like agenerative business
    - set of principles... that is not optimizing wages at the top, but distributes it so that everyone has a living wage... 
    - can we do money conversion to flourishing, and can we manage a network of businesses effectively 
- Jane
    - are you assuming one model of governance is appropriate for all
        - economic (ecosystem of businesses)
        - social cultural 
        - rights
        - each have unique nuances. 
- It is all hypothesis - so whatever we do is a test of that hypothesis... 
- Any business... shaped by economic and social realities it serves... 
    - In short term old world... businesses have to profit to survive (potential problem)
    - 
- not about short term thinking with domapine 
- Investors who understand the long term
    - short term is ROI... 
    - but also impacting continued legacy... 
    - so that after 10 years - willing to step aside from ownership so that neighborhood can flourish... 
    - After 8 years - 30k / month going back into the hands of hte community - to invest in microloans to help with home ownership... 
        - homes increasingly owned outside community and outside country... 
        - to local community land trusts... 
- Forrist
    - building thriving regional food ecosystems... 
    - the relationship of all regional ecosystemtic elements to one another... 
    - nature of governance - networks plural not network
    - how do you put together governance for networks, where members are alliance or coalition of networks, which is different than governance of specific organization or network... 
        - an allinace of multiple networks, or single business networks... 
    - concept of marketplaces - how critical marketplaces are to be able to really generate revenue flow necessary to regenerate and rebuild a particular community based on what community itself articulates through faciliated process over a period of months... 
    - 
        - revenue flow
        - rebuild what the community wants
- Black assembly of God / church of God network - so could be scalable and deployed in many places using faith based communities... 
- 
- learn from this project and then scale
- Discrete autonomous identites stepping out of identiteis to participate in something different - that leads to conflicting interests... 
    - vs. netowrk of people who are contributing to different uses
    - generative business contrives many different uses, revenue streams, times of day, etc... 
    - federated co-op model - taking into the DAO realm... 
    - Functioanl and identity limitations keep showing up - I wonder why? 
    - by naming a netowrk of businesses - honoring difference as well as wholeness... 
    - Network of to happen to us as individuals... give we are trained to see mine, network, territory, identity... 
    - so that we can work in wholeness... 
    - Individual entrepreneurs in a network? 
    - or a conglomerate managed by one governance structure? 
    - what is the set of principles to be part? 
    - do we use what exists in the place? 
        - take what exists and exapt
    - Some type of governance, across a bunch of businesses, connected together as a unit... 
    - if we have money coming out... how do we govern how it does... 
- B Corp certifications... 
- DAOs... 
- Sub model of certification for generative business, that is a form of B Corp... 
- Co-Ops, 
- Trusts... 
- Solve the underlying problem... of is your goal of a board member to maximize shareholder revenue... or other obligations

- Jordan
    - long history with dense interaction with Mondragon
        - where this model works and where it does not
        - interview with the keeper of Mondragon - Jose
    - synthesis into a system of system
        - in any community
        - customised
        - allow interoperability
- go to this part of recording for details
- figure it out for one generative community and all of them are different
    - figure out the complexity as we go

Bill Larson
- lifetime and record that
- expressing it simply is challenge
- pull people towards expressing their problems by induction
- series of classes or sessions to discuss each of the elements
- BCorp LC3 - moderating structures
- Solve a different problem -
- intergenerational cutoff of equity value... 
- dysfunction seeps in value that was grow over long time - could value been used all along the way - more real time - now non-profit is there to serve rather than solve problem
- non-profits incentivised seek money and always stay in business
- none of the decisions are enough... 
- if a for profit is completely free to act in certain ways... 
- non profit certain benefits - what if we merge them? 
- The non profit owns the for profit -
- C Corp is owned by non-profit
- there is never a problem of duty to shareholder
- at the very bottom is community of values
    - free participation of people of like mind
    - Values and purpose oriented community
    - give rise to intergenerational protection of values
    - not dissipating the equity after one generation
    - various forms of joint venture and cooperative relationship
    - considers human impact, universal elements, onboarding - training etc need to be knit into the structure
