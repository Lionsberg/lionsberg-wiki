# 2022.10.04 Social Architecture
(Jordan's Notes)

## Debrief From Last Weeks
- coming out of deep processing, starting to percolate... 
- how we onboard into collaborative spaces... 
- Composting... 
- What is Meta Project? 
    - Affecting people's willingness to participate... 
    - At the basic level: 
        - Is it that we are doing our best to learn to be a group when things are unclear? 
        - People are leaving because it is unclear... 
            - What are the technologies that let us stay together... 
            - and how to pick projects that allow us to be a group more... 
        - vs. how can we keep gaining and regaining clarity even though objectives are unclear... 
- Social dimensions are tough to define to start... 
    - how we might attempt to understand background, their proclivities... 
    - IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE IT TO PEOPLE... 
        - What you think an elephant is depends on where you start washing it... 
        - Subunits will have distinct personalities...
        - Need to ID traits... 
        - Clarify... 
        - not interfere with existing teams working effectively... 
        - and figuring out how their framework, output, sharing will work with rest of the group... 
        - What do various groups think they bring? Is that needed now, or take back seat... 
- We are struggling with keeping up - because things are moving faster than I thought they would - which suggests we may want to start contests, etc... 
    - what is our criteria... 
- If we were going to craft an invitation... what would we send... what would be the benefits... 
    - Who is audience
    - what are we trying to market
    - what is funnel we want them to flow through
    - to reach what desired output? 
    - Extra level of commitment on people's parts... really working together to produce something... if it is really additive... 
- Part of complexity
    - is that we don't know what the options are we could enable
    - the number of participatns we might engage in what capacity... 
    - We are playing in the whole world - makes it attractive but difficult to define... 
- Wendy E - are we about PROCESS or CONTENT? 
    - If we can stand for the very best of process - involved and aware of process, and results... 
    - one thing you can do is get better for process... 
    - What is the quality of the decision for what to do with $50,000 US... 
    - the process is reproducible... 
    - if we can maintain realtionships, make difficult decisions, and continuously improve the process... 
    - If I say - I don't fully agree, and I will get behind it as we experiment and learn... can we make a decision, that doesn't go my way, that I will get behind, and we will monitor and track... 
    - and we can actually define these things at this level... 
    - Wendy E - I would prefer we stand on teh side of PROCESS - and get really good at it... 
    - Tricky thing - we have to do it with a project, and get feedback of the people we are trying to preserve... 
    - Have to have a FOCUS to get PROCESS better... get really good at how we MEAUSURE THE RESULTS... parallel projects... 
- Map the process... 
    - then run experiments through them... 
    - Is it replicable across disciplines, scopes, etc. 
    - FIGURING OUT A REPEATABLE PROCESS BASED ON THE PATTERNS... 
    - making the process of collaboration better for everyone... 
        - a better and better process for how we do what? 
        - Mindful with process to serve OUTPUT
        - have to be clear about basic parameters... 
        - what you would offer depends on group, personalities, with their nascent processes (that will not be consistent) - which gets into dynamics of invitations to change... can't be pushed... so have to invite consideration of different ways of doing things... 
- To offer any wisdom to a group - have to first understand them... what is important to them... so that perhpas you can offer something... 
- teams at diffrent levels of effectiveness... diffrent levels of leadership... a lot to tackle... really important to be clear with our wishes... 
    - so they get what is good... 
    - and we learn what we need to learn... 
- Recognizing a process, faciliatting a process, tailoring to culture and groups based on needs, wants painpoints, celebration... the work of that needs resourcing and support... 
    - That work is criticla to collaboration, creativity, innovation... 
    - So much more work, time, attention, effort, focus that goes into one galvanizing moment... the hours that go into prepping a group make a decision together, helping decide priorities, helping apply process well known to one discipline... and transfer to another... super difficult... 
- The work of creatiing infrastructure often goes unknown and unfunded... 
    - RESOURCES ARENT" THERE... 
- Clear about people's time and efforts, coming in at right time, and right places... 
- Social change groups - participants are burnt out... 
    - Do we know what they want / need / what current epxerience is 
    - MINIMUM COMMUNICATION OF NEEDS AND OFFERS... 
    - LISTENING... 
- We are not using mattermost properly... 
- We are not using wiki properly... 
- Multi-dimmensional 
    - endlessly complex dendritic structure... 
    - so much dimmensionality... 
    - so much opportunity for uniqueness... because of emergence... 
    - so it is a constructive paradox... 
    - to try to faciliate emergence... at same time. you support it with structures... 

## Priorities - Possiblity
1. Recieving the presenting back information / maps
2. Creating communication flow / process - bring in, consider, and communicate back out - synthesize... 
3. Resourcing 
4. How we prioritize and navigate... 

Doing this is the context of PROCESS - that can continuously grow energy... recognize what is possible and where things are going... 

## Challenges
- one element thwarting us - we have people with different levels of experience, level of understanding, knowledge bases... 
- what Wendy sees happen - is people who come in with an agenda... or a sense of expertise... or a sense of learning edge, or curiousity... and have something to share... 
    - incredibly valuable, and if that person is not open hearted and open minded to listen... ends up dominating and killing the energy... 
    - Energy is necessary for people in room to figure out the emergence between them... 
    - ideally we are all listening to the thing that is being brought forward / wants to emerge... 
    - pause - consdiering how I can be additive to the conversation... 
    - Then that additive piece- how do we recognize when it is learning edge, vs. groups learning edge, vs. communities learning edge... 
- We enter into pieces - with people operating with different scopes... and scales of being... 
- 1. mapping and comms rhythms / PROCESS... 
- 2. Interface betweene elements... 
- 3. Intra capacity building... 

## 3 views
1. Community / Confederation
    - weekly meetings / people need RHYTHMS in their lives... the battle rhythm... the cadence 
2. INTERface... between elements 
3. INTRA... within elements... 

## Learning
- people can only learn at the cutting edge of where their learning is... 
- might be a fast track or a quantum tunnel... after awakening moments... but complexity of the world is largely created by these edges that don't match... even the assessment of the problem... 

## Hypothesis of What's Next
- Wendy E: Learn to be comfortable with emergence and not knowing... 
    - Clarity of how we understand the problem. 
    - Language and process for dealing with emergence and not knowing... 
    - And how we match the right tools to the right levels of complexity... 
- Wendy M: Meta project needs a core group of people to receive information, mindfully consider, and reflect it back to the community... 
    - Clarity, week to week, on what to do with information... people accountable to receiving information... talking about how information relates to all the pieces that are happening... 
    - A group that can check their own egos at the door, and process, wear multiple hats... 
    - THE PRACTICE - 
        - of how and when to invite in the right pieces...
        - be able to integrate that into the PROCESS... present the next way, gather the responses... 
    - THE COMMITTED CORE TEAM... Getting that cycle down - in the next 6 weeks, experiment cycling in information... prioritized from the group... 
    - considered effort to reflect back... in an emergent way... this is what is coming back down... 
- Wendy M - something like Flint for value based collaborative decision making... 
    - what are teh questions we rate by 
    - what are the actions, considerations, projects that flow from that... 
    - Consensus around next steps in a way that keeps everyone engaged... 
- ACCOUNTABLE GROUP OF PEOPLE...
- Judy 
    - I don't necessarily see the path to take advantage of the wisdom / opportunity zones we have shared... 
    - and how to invite people into those places
    - readiness for uncertainty is very variable... 
    - making it ok to feel insecure and uncertain - IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO becoming self aware and moving... 
        - beyond defensive posture
        - or self-serving agenda... 
        - people not paying attentio to what is good for group... but what is good for them... 
    - as we scale - how do we know how to provide what is needed, when it is needed... how do we identify opportunities, and right match of offers to needs at the right time, 
    - On the learning edge... get ourselves onto the learning edge / meaning edge... 
    - then the just in time delivery of the right pieces at the right time.. 
- Conundrum - how do we make visible... the potential pieces, let them select what might work... 
    - not being in any way prescriptive... 

## ONBOARDING...
