From last meeting

## Swahili words Jordan needs to learn
- Uko Sawa - You are doing well

## Nairobi Prototype
- Location in flux - still an issue to resolve... 
    - End of last year (second year on site) - fell behind on rent payments... had to close the school 2 weeks early. There is an outstanding balance (1.7M starting in september). 
        - If we pay (800,000KS) we can use the facility (existing facility)
        - Agreement on how to settle remaining fee of (900,000)...
    - September 5 - School Starts (1.5 weeks out) 
    - Monthly Rent - 150,000 KS... 
- Adjustments 
    - Going forward - buld the school from the bottom up... 
    - Starting playschool / kindergarten to grade 6 elementary school. 
    - Start phasing off the high schoolers - not extendng expenses into high school. 
    - School grow stage by stage...  
- Approximately 25 students... approx 4 new students want to join... 
    - 65,000 Fee per term per child x 3 terms = 195,000 KS
    - x 25 students 
    - Total Revenue $4,875,000 KS 
    - x 29 students
    - 5,655,000 KS
- Expense Side
    - Rent: 150,000 KS x 12 months = 1,800,000 KS 
    - Teachers and Staff = 275,000 KS / month x 9 = 2,475,000
        - December Holiday
        - April Holiday 
        - July and August Holiday
    - Food, Supplies, etc. = 70k to 120k / month - estimate 100k / month = 800,000 KS 
    - Total = 5,075 
    - Deficit at 25 students = 200,000 KS ~ $1,700 dollars 
    - Surplus at 29 students = 580,000 KS ~ 4,833 dollars 
- Debt Repayment
    - At 29 students, with fiscal discipline, we should be able to repay 580k of 1.7M KS - which leaves us 1.12M KS short... 
- Extracurriculars
    - Football, dance, swimming - paid separately 
    - Run at a reasonable profit that works for the parents...
- Transportation
    - Look at as a separate business operation, with its own income and expenses... 
        - Issue 1: Transporation to and from school - students and teachers 
        - Issue 2: Transportaton to and from Pokot is exhorbitant... because of road, etc...
    -  29 students... of which 24 
        -  7,800 / student / month 
    -  Look at it on a per van basis
    -  Van - that can get around Nairobi, and get around Kenya to places like Pokot. 
        -  Revenue Stream 1: We can cover the base cost for the van by transporting full capacity of students to school each day 
            -  Revenue from Mt. Zion school(s)
            -  Revenue from Other Schools
        -  Revenue Stream 2: We can also use the van to handle outreach missions to surrounding villages, schools, etc. 
            -  Revenue from Mt. Zion churches
            -  Revenue from Other churches 
    -  For example - 40 students... 
        -  Research 
            -  What does 1 4o to 50 seat bus cost, and what are its capabilities/ pros / cons...? 
            -  What does 2 20 seat vans/ busses cost, and what would capabilities, pros, cons be? 
            -  What does 3 or 4 14 seater
        -  Hypothesis: 
            -  Sub divide Nairobi into 4 parts
            -  Get 4 14 seater vans with removable seats so that they can haul people or supplies... 
            -  Make sure that at least one of teh 4 has 4WD... 
-  Price of 33 seater 4.5 million
-  Price of a van - 1 million 
-  Homework for estelle and Jacque
    -  Figure out costs and finance for 4 vans
    -  Figure out revenue per student per van 
    -  Figure our revenue / savings from trips to Pokot
-  If any of the 4 regions of Nairobi are not running at capacity (the vans are full every day) - figure out what other schools or churches or parents you could partners so that each van runs 100% full each day. 
-  See if there is an affordable price, that creates a surplus / profit, that is enough to pay down the 1.7M in debt over the course of the school year
    -  1.7M / 8 months
    -  So - if you could run the transporation business at 220k / profit per month x 8 months = 1.76 M KS profit = debt repaid. 

## Is This Possible? 
- 1M KS Van... 
- 13.5% - that is terrible extortion... 
- Down Payment: 200k 
- Loan = 800k x 13.9% for 36 months = 27,303 / month... 
- Revenue
    - Seat 1 Driver
    - Seat 2 Minder
    - 7,800 / month per student x 12 seats = 93,600 KS / month
- Expenses
    - Loan 27,303 
    - Driver (Or volunteer) - 18,000 KS 
    - Minder - Teacher - salary paid elsewhere. 
    - Fuel - 1 tank per week, 7,500 x 4 weeks = 30,000
    - If we are paying the driver monthly, what are they doing the rest of the day? 
    - Total Expenses: 75 KS / Month
- Profit per Van 
    - Approx 20k x 4 vans = 80k KS / month
    - Savings from Trips to Pokot 
        - Usually cost per van is 12k / day... 10 days there... 120,000... 
- What else can van do to earn revenue... 
    - Cannot do any work other than school work 
- What can be done to increase the profitability... 
    - Jacque - missions exclusive transport for network of churches... 
    - Tour style vans are 14k / day... to 18k / day... 

## Pokot Prototype
- The materials are available on the ground
- Interlocking bricks, locally avaialable soil... 
- Inexpensive walls - only need cement. 
- 130 bags of cement get 10 bricks, which is enough for 3 classrooms
- 1 brick 20 shillings inclusive of labor - 5 bricks 1 dollar. 
- Roof - iron sheets and timber, wires - 380,000 - $3,200
- Quotation for standard buildng in that place - was going to be 1.2 million. 
- If we can use interlocking blocks, cost will come down to 600k shillings for 3 classrooms... 
- vs. 3.6 million... 
- labor is 230,000
- materials 380,000
- total 610,000 - needed from now... ($5,100)
    - Initially spent 227,000 including cost of transportaiton and brick machines..
    - Total for proejct 840,000 shillings. 
    - Up to about 1,000,000 - transport is costly - have to hire 4wd to take us there... 
    - $8,333 USD. 
- $5,100 for 3 classrooms and two toilets..
    - $1,000 
    - Pledge of 50 shillings, last week raised 60,000
- Then county pays for the teachers... 
- 

## Measurement and Story Telling
- How do we tell the story of what is possible?
