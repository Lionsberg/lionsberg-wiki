# 2022.10.05 Navigation Meeting

## Topics
- Wendy and Jason presentation on complexity frameworks and langauge
- Quarterly Navigation


## Complexity Language and Frameworks
- What's going on here? 
- Sense-making from the bottom up. 
- It's useful to know you don't know... 
- Clear
- Complicated
- Complex
- Chaotic
- What tools work in what different places... 
- The power is in making rules... to move things into other sections... 
    - I.E. moving from complicated to clear via clear rules that enable quick action that can be improved over time. 
- Complexity - only patterns, not solutions... the more people... can see more... try many things... iterate... adjust... the key is to realize you are going to fail early and often to find the true levers that change the pattern consistently... 
- What are the patterns we want to change? 
- What methods are we going to use to change? 
- Understanding the real subtleties of why ceratin things work in one place, and not another... need very subtle information about what is going on... the minute you assume you know what is going on... you do not... 
- ACTION: If I can get a couple poeple to do training - can get access to sense maker... need a couple other people... 

- measuring things... revealing subtle stories... knowing where you are wrong and being able to survive that emotionally.. 
- Sense Maker for 6 Months... 
    - 2-3 people doing training - access can start earlier by negotiation
- Three courses - $39 - a few hours... a couple hours a week... 
    - https://thecynefin.co/learning-training/
- and ready to roll end of the year... 

## Dialogue... 
- Hypothesis: 
    - Engage projects at 3 levels of analysis
    - Creating maps
    - Processes and systems that continuous improve... 
- Learning quickly - set up to measure / discover as you go... 
    - designing the metrics into the project at the beginning... 
    - learning the subtleties of solution sets - learning where they learn and where they don't... 
    - Local resources differ in every single instance... 
- Creating target conditions / milestones for the week / PPC every week... 
    - setting targets and objectives towards the end... 
    - what are milestones along the way... 
    - how do we pivot along the way... 
    - iterations with data... finding the simplifications, intervention points... 
    - have to get close to real time... resources available now... 
- Have to have people make commitments... 
    - figuring out ways to allocaate time... 
    - How to engage diversity... 
- Forrist - there is the clear recognition that the indivudal has to be doing their own work... raising consciousness / maturity / capacity... 
    - givven audacious goals... 
    - Richness of relationships
    - We can create filters - so that when we attract people in - assessments, methodologies... framing that gets to who is in and who is out at what levels... 
    - vs individual desire to show up as the core criteria... 
- Commitment and engagemenet levels... data at multiple levels... 
- Personal development... 
- CO-CREATE - JUST ENOUGH STRUCTURE - DIRECTION... 
- Qualifying people before they enter spaces - and beyond that allowing people to self-select before they enter a space... 
    - If clarify of structure and direction... 
    - can choose whether I want to come in or not... 
    - If I can take a look at an array of options... and be able to align and choose... 
    - Being able to receive information - so we can self-select into the right spots... 
        - and the immediacy of those feedback loops
        - to see in real time what is going on 
        - so we can be adaptive / flexible / responsive to the needs... 
- So much relationships, knowledge, networks present... 
- Meauring / noticing / bringing the question of value... 
- 1. What is possible when we start mapping
- 2. there is value
- 3. for ourselves comes valuable - and becomes a resource... 
- Multiple concurrent experiements going - where each group that is experiementing is sharing learning into the circle so that collective learning can occur... 
- With sustainable systems 
    - There is an upstream component - measuring what is happening in our own system as we try to deliver... 
    - As we do that work - seeing how we are broken as we do that - so we don't keep hemoragging good people... 
    - the subtleties of making sure we can stay connected, remain functional - is learning of an essentila type... 
    - exposing the things that aren't working... 
- Forrist - 
    - What I have a sense of - is that there is specific roles needed to do it well...
    - those roles need to be articulated in writing... 
    - including the three or four core chunks of data... 
    - monitoring and accountability... 
    - what are the roles that are really critical... knowing what those are... then the opening and invitation to step into that role... 
    - I understand the commitment and expectation... 
    - FORRIST - WE HAVE A CHALLENGE THERE IN PC... 
- The three teams... 
    - roles
    - Judy - what's and who's
    - tasks to be done... timing... 
    - then people can more easily find where they fit... 
    - Helping ensure a little congruence but not too much between the sub-teams being formed... 
- Templating of the what, the who, the how... 
    - in a way that allows for additional whats, hows, and whos so the richness can emerge more fully... 
- The template continuoulsy improves... as gaps are exposed... 
    - Template learns from each team / project / organization that forms... 
- WENDY - has work to share on continuously improving structure... 
    - What is the process by which we invite people in... 
    - create clarity... 
- Exciting parts of how network is coalescing... 
    - All around on-boarding... 
    - deep listening...
    - how we guide the right people to the right places... 
    - Which are the core patterning... 
    - Real time data points... showing many people and projects galvanizing around this piece... 
- Important to move from high level... 
    - into projects and teams... 
    - Get in and start... 
- Support and sense that adding in Regen Ag... alongside the other three levels... 
- Morgan
    - Would like to put hat in the ring... 
    - Towards **PMO** core group... Program Management Organization... 
    - including the tech piece of that... 
- What is the "bottom up" / what is the bottom...? 
- How can you help? 
    - you can't unless you know their needs
    - and then you have something you can do or possess to meet those
    - and the ability to energy, organize, and implement action towars meeting those needs.
- Are the needs to big / abstract / difficult? 
    - Serving and uniting the poeple working towards ends... 
- Julie - 
    - Having a hard time tracking activity outside the calls... 
    - hard to find ways to get involved... 
    - not clear where I can plug in and be useful... 
    - what is the onboarding...
- Bill - 
    - unique thing - bringing things together.
- Michael - 
    - unique opportunity to be spark of connection between other groups... 
- Forrist - 
    - initial step relative to understanding needs... 
    - Pokot... 
    - Estonia... 
    - UN / Networks...
