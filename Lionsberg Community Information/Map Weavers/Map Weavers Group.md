# Map Weavers Group
Relationships are the new currency. Creative and coordinated action at unprecedented scale is the only viable option forward for the human race. Networks are blossoming everywhere. We're using technology to build beautiful, lovable tools to serve relationships and collective action. With which people can find and get to know each other and work together. Which gather data and age it gracefully. Which help you:

- see what's hidden to gain deeper understanding
- recognize patterns (concerns, best practices)
- match needs with offers
- discover synergies
- reveal the gaps
- serve collaboration

The goal of this group is to create a tool with which people can find and get to know each other. Relationships are the new currency.

Maps for connecting people and communities to what they need, when they need it.

Ultimately, creating the tools needed for recognizing the patterns - both concerns and best practices - that deserve collective action.

Seeing the value created in the community.

To create maps that enable people to interact with data, produce the visuals needed for deeper understanding, match needs with offers, discover the synergies, reveal the gaps and serve collaboration.
