# Project Proposals

A great deal of the activity of the [[Meta Project]] will be done within projects. In a private direct message with Jordan, he identified these six steps.

1. vision / intention for each area
2. analysis for existing reality / forces / conditions
3. written plan of action, vetted by wise advisors
4. WHO do you need to engage to cross the chasm between [[What Is]] and the better and higher future state? 
5. act out the plan
6. continuously improve the quality of vision / analysis / engagement / planning / action as you iterate towards the goal

In a separate conversation, Bill Larson helped me write a [[Project Proposal Template]]. Using that as a guide, here are several project proposals.

[[Civilization 2.0]]  
[[Education Stipend]]  
[[Game Proposal from Bill and Jonathan]]
