# Project Proposals

A great deal of the activity of the [[Meta Project]] will be done within [[Projects]].  

Projects are initiated on the basis of [[Proposals]] and [[Consent]]. 

A basic project proposal / process will include: 

1. **Vision** and Intention ([[Designer's Intent]]) 
2. **Analysis** of the existing reality / forces / conditions
3. **Engagement**: **Who** do you need to engage to cross the chasm between [[What Is]] and the better and higher future state that is intended to be?  
4. **Strategy and Plan**: Written strategy and plan of action, vetted by wise advisors  
5. **[[Embody And Enact]]** the plan    
6. [[Retrospection]] and [[Continuous Improvement]]: Continuously improve the quality of vision / analysis / engagement / planning / action / Rest as you iterate towards the goal

In a separate conversation, Bill Larson helped me write a [[Writing Project Proposals]]. Using that as a guide, here are several project proposals.
