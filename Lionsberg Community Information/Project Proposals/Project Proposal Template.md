# Project Proposal Template
When you write a proposal for your project, Bill Larson suggests that these four sections will help a lot.

## Need
Describe the issue that needs to be resolved or problem that needs a solution. Is it a thing to be added or to be removed?
## Context
Layout the current socio-economic context in which the need resides. A community or a person?
## Implications
What happens if we don't put effort into addressing this need.  What or who is in pain? Describe the pain. 
## Solution
Describe the project succinctly and show how it will address the need and bring socio-economic benefit to the community.

### Notes

IRAC method (**i**ssue, **r**ules, **a**pplication, **c**onclusion)  
SPIN selling (**s**ituation, **p**roblem, **i***mplications*, **n**eeds fulfillment)  

***Implications*** are the most important, nearly always neglected component of the sales process. Ask profound questions. What is the impact of the problem? How is this need felt, detected? What is the cost associated with not resolving it? How does that compare with the cost of resolving it?
