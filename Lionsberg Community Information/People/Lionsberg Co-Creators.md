# Lionsberg Co-Creators

We are monitoring the growth of [[The Tree]] of Lionsberg that is emerging from [[The Golden Seed]]. The [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] are like growth rings on a tree that help us measure and monitor [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The [[Emergence]] unfurls itself along the [[Fibonacci]] sequence found throughout the [[Living System]]. The number of [[Co-Creators]] in each Cycle is equal to the two previous numbers combined together. See [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] for the full sequence. 

We are monitoring the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] to gauge how efficiently we can [[Progress]] through the **50 Cycles** required to move the entire human population [[FROM the Old TO the New]], ensuring that this occurs within [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 

The measurement of the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] begins from March 1, 2024, and follows [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], during which dozens of allies around the world contributed to the Co-Creation of [[The Conditions]] for for an entirely unprecedented Movement of Co-Creation to emerge. 

It's looking good. Shall we keep nurturing this?

- Against the ~40 to 60 invitations required, we now have a running list of ~130 well qualified candidates and a significantly compelling center of gravity.   
- Additionally, for the first time we have the [[The Invitation Pool]] composed *primarily* of names surfaced through the collective wisdom and discernment of the Lionsberg Co-Creators, and not merely Jordan.
