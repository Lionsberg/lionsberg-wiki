# Jonathan Sand
I am a wandering engineer, a dreamer, an optimist.  I am ethically maturing. I prefer being reliable because it aids collaborating. I am not perfect, I am a work in progress. I love to think about things that are familiar to me. I like to move into new systems of thinking. I mostly know when to shut up and listen, not always. I am sensitive to what seems broken, a blessing and a curse.

I have the soul of an artist and think in 3D; language is a second language. It has not escaped me that language can be amazing. I love that humans invented it. I am perplexed that we have weaponized it. The non-technical skills I am learning include collective intelligence, empathy, writing. I've been writing code for 40 years.

I am an essentialist and relate that way to the world around me. Things, art, people, knowledge, ideas.

People are worth connecting to, tapping into the real stuff, substance. I am new to being in relationship rather than in transaction. What a relief, much easier. But I prefer one on one, especially when each spoken part is short.

This world is not set up for most of us to thrive. This strikes me as dumb. We can do way better and now is the time to do it. So, what do you think? How might a perfect world look? As an exercise in imagination, [I wrote about it here](http://www.civilization2.org). I suck at marketing it.

So here I am. The Meta Project feels like it could be home. Hesitantly, I am adding some of my ideas to this wiki. I'd love feedback and collaboration.

I'm also working with Bill Larson on an idea:
