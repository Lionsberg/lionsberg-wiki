# Jordan Nicholas Sukut

Jordan Nicholas Sukut incarnated for [[The War]], localized the [[LIONSBERG System]] to English and Earth, issued [[The Invitation]] to humanity, and then died in The War. 

This was necessary so that [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] could rise. 

At the Time of [[J's Death]] **The Mission** was ~200 days ahead of schedule. Now, it is up to us. 

To find out what happened to Jordan, see [[Existential Threat - Reporting Back From Battle]]. 

[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]] is a ~30 minute overview and map of where he left off, and what his extraordinary journey revealed. 

If [[Jordan's Short Story]] is True, your life and loved ones are in grave danger.  

[[Above The Chaos]] followed The Story in realtime.
