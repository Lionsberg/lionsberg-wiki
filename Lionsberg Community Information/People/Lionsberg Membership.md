# Lionsberg Membership

We started with eternal and universal Inspiration and Vision, that progressed towards an articulated Idea. 

We progressed to discussions between [[Jordan]] and a few others.

We then assessed the [[Critical Path]], and began progressing. 

We then assessed conditions via a Social Dimensions group. 

Then a few dozen people from around the world began coming together weekly to discuss how we might collaborate on the One Thing that unites us all at this crucial juncture in human history.

Then, we forged a Field of Agreements and embarked on a transformational [[Quest]]. 

Eventually, you may find here a directory of some of our co-creators around the world.
