# What Makes You Think This Will Help And Not Harm? 
Recognizing that the most significant crisis and opportunity in history is at hand, the question is how we should be and act in the face of that reality. 

Recognizing that the existing institutions have grown far too corrupted and willfully blind to coordinate their efforts to solve the [[Meta Crisis]] and accomplish the [[Meta Goal]], we believe that we, all of us, have the ethical duty to [[Act As If]] it were our responsibility. 

If we are going to take responsiblity and act, and since no individual or organization or institution can accomplish the Goal in isolation, we logically must [[Organize and Federate]]. 

Because no existing institution could accomplish the Goal, and because of the history, boards, bureaucracies, and divisions between existing organizations and institutions, we had to forge a clean New structure / community / gathering place that is transcendent of the past. 

And we are doing that in the most thoughtful, comprehensive way we possibly can given the resources and relationships we have at each stage of the journey. 

Critically, we are avoiding some of the known methods that harm / fail by: 

1. Avoiding over-centralization by protecting the sovereignty and autonomy of each individual and group
2. Making progress through voluntary collaboration among sovereign and autonomous agents reflective of their [[Current Best Understanding]], rather than top down command and control 
3. Building shared infrastructure and services to meet needs and solve problems that are shared by All
4. Treating each and every individual as if they were uniquely created in the image of God, loved by God, and therefore equal before God and One Another in rights and responsibilities. 
5. Building the System and Community as if it had to optimize for All over the course of millennia, vs. one provencial group over the short term. 
6. Building the System and Community based on sovereignty and interoperability among a diverse multitude of perspectives and solutions. 
7. Continuously improving our [[Current Best Understanding]] via a Prototype, and the shared infrastructure and services required to localize, adapt, and deploy that prototype to millions of localities. 
8. Rooting the movement in individual agency and responsibility, rather than dependency on external forces. 
9. Doing our best to articulate and honor the timeless [[Wisdom]], [[Principles]], and [[Values]] that cause people, societies, and life to flourish in harmony. 
10. Doing our best to articulate and honor the [[Patterns of Success]] / Life that lead towards flourishing, and avoid the [[Patterns of Failure]] / Death that lead towards suffering. 
11. Working to strengthen and empower the individual and local. 
12. Working to build the shared infrastructure and solutions that no individual or locality can possess or create in isolation. 

Most of all, we are attempting to thoughtfully articulate a [[Way of Being]] that is as wise, as competent, and as good as we possibly can, and to ensure that we [[Get A Little Better Every Day]] as we advance towards the Goal, and help All things advance with us. 

We are doing our best in service to accomplish the [[Meta Goal]] in service of [[One]] and [[All]], and we believe that is the safest, most helpful, and most powerful paradigm through which we could perceive and act in this moment in history. 

By empowering a global community to voluntarily coordinate resources and energy in service of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] we can conceive of, the possibility of solving the [[Meta Crisis]] and accomplishing the [[Meta Goal]] comes into reality.
