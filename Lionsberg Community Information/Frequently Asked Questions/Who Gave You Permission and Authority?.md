# Who Gave You Permission and Authority?
The Lionsberg Meta Project is not derived from the permission or authority of any existing institution or authority. 

Its authority comes only from [[One]]. 

We are not acting based on the permission of any element of the [[Old]] system. We are acting based on our responsibility to [[God]] and to [[All]] to orgnanize ourselves to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in history. 

Over time, it will gain authority and capability to act on greater scales in direct proportion to the number of people participating in it and choosing to act as one.  

If enough people chose to [[Help One Another]] act out this system and logic, a flourishing [[New Era]] is already at hand.
