# How Did You Get Here? 
We got here by combining many lifetimes of work in service of the [[One Thing]] that unites us All. 

Lionsberg and the Meta Project are being co-created through the autonomous yet coordinated action of participants around the world. 

The [[Requests For Guidance]] page offers some snapshots in time of where we have been at various points in time. 

The Requests For Guidance pick up after Jordan invited a small group friends and allies into a social experiment in early 2022. 

Prior to that, Jordan spent several years designing and building philosophical, conceptual, legal, and technological infrastructure with various allies in preparation. 

That effort brought together lifetimes of work from many contributors who had independently spent years building infrastructure and capabilities in various areas. 

For Jordan's story that leads up to that, see [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]]. 

We look forward to weaving the stories of many more individuals in over time.
