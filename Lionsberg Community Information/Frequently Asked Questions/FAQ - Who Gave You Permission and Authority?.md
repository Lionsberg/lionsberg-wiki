# FAQ - Who Gave You Permission and Authority?

The [[Authority]] of [[Lionsberg]] flows not from [[Permission]] from any earthly Authority, but rather from our universal [[Responsibility]] to [[One]] and [[All]]. 

We did not seek Permission, nor will we seek Permission.

We are impelled by the deep sense of [[Responsibility]] and [[Authority]] that belongs to every child of the [[One]]. 

Our [[Authority]] to act comes from the [[Responsibility]] we have to [[One]] and [[All]] to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] to organize ourselves to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in history.  

Over time, it will gain authority and capability to act on greater scales in direct proportion to the number of people participating in it and choosing to act as one.
