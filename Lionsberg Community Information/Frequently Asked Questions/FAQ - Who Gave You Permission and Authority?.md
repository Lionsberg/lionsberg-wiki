# FAQ - Who Gave You Permission and Authority?

The permission and authority of Lionsberg are entirely derived from the voluntary consent of participating and engaged citizens. 

The Lionsberg System is a citizen-led initiative, meaning it is not based on any specific individual or group's authority or permission. It is based on the collective desire for a better future for all, the ethical imperative for citizens to arise and unite in the face of the Meta Crisis, and the principles of truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom. It is up to each individual to decide for themselves if they want to align with and support the Lionsberg System and its values. Additionally, the system is built on the idea of distributed decision-making, meaning that authority and decision-making power is distributed among the community members and not centralized in any one individual or group. The idea is to create a self-organizing, self-governing and self-sustaining society. 

This is philosophically based on the principle that when we all seek first right relationship with one another, the earth, and the mystery of the Creator, everything else will be added unto us.

Our [[Authority]] to act comes from the [[Responsibility]] we have to [[One]] and [[All]] to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] to organize ourselves to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in history.  

Over time, Lionsberg will gain authority and capability to act on greater scales in direct proportion to the number of citizens participating in it.
