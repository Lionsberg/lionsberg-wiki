# Map Weavers - Phase 2
Meta Project Use Case

## Use Case

The Map Weavers group is working with Meta Project to build out a process that is intended to serve the entire community. We want to know with greater certainty that our outputs are useful and effective by gathering feedback. We have agreed with Jordan to work with another sovereign to do this: a group of engaged strategists who can help answer questions, provide specifics and evaluate our effectiveness.  

Meta Project is asking for these maps: 

1.  Engaged people and projects - DO THIS FIRST 
    
2.  Potential people who could benefit from or contribute to Meta Project - INVITE THIS SECOND
    
3.  Funding sources - 
    
4.  Matching: What people are looking to serve, and what they need to serve that 
    
5.  Mapping the PM - who’s doing what / where / when
    

  

These maps will support:

1.  Weaving further connections 
    
2.  Prioritizing projects and tasks along a ‘pipeline’ of P2P connections, projects and possibilities
    
3.  Creating coordinated projects that then will need funding
    
4.  Seeking funding for emerging projects
    

  

On a Meta level, this will then assist with:

1.  Creating a standard input / output format for weekly ‘reporting’
    
2.  Encouraging momentum and community engagement
    
3.  Matching funding with projects
    

  

Intended Process

1.  People within Map Weavers will interview current and/or new members of Meta Project
    
2.  Interviewers will be provided with a standard questionnaire which will capture answers within AirTable
    
3.  The questionnaire will be designed over the next 2 weeks
    
4.  The remaining steps for how best to conduct interviews will also be decided in the next few weeks

## Questions to Consider 

Please add / amend / comment here

  

Maybe we can pick one topic or thread to focus on: 

ie: Ecorestoration / Regenerative Ag

  

Fields To Add For Profiles of Individuals:

1.  Your mission
    
2.  Your superpowers / strengths (www.viacharacter.org)
    
3.  Your passion
    
4.  Other groups you are closely working with
    
5.  People you working closely with
    

  

For matching:

What do see yourself being the input to…  

What do you need?

  
  

Fields to Capture Potential

1.  What other people and projects do you know that should be connected to the Meta Project?
    

  
  

Fields To Add For Profiles of Projects:

1.  Other groups or projects you see as closely aligned with your work
    
2.  Other groups and projects you think are a compliment to the work you are doing
    

  
  

Fields to Add for Funders looking for Projects: 

(to be a focus in next week’s meeting)

-   Tipping points - already entering this … there is urgency around turning the corner in improvements.    (e.g., [https://amazonia80x2025.earth/](https://amazonia80x2025.earth/) )
    

-   Restoration is key - to cool and reverse the deforestation to keep what we have
    
-     
    

-   What we measure matters
    

-   Can get overwhelmed with data.  So need to focus on most essential. “Optimally Inaccurate Indicators”
    

-   Criteria
    

-   Key pieces need to include: how the average person can get involved.
    
-   We need to map where to put the investment $s to make the most impact.
    
-   Is the site scalable?  Are there existing investors (gov., international development assistance, etc.)  Defending the defenders from threats, assassination. Plus many other criteria.

Cole: There is an upcoming event where many of these ideas will be discussed further as well: The Just One Giant Summit (JOGS) event. It is set to occur on July 1st, you can find out more about it here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/just-one-giant-summit-july-2022-registration-331824976437](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/just-one-giant-summit-july-2022-registration-331824976437)

Pete: META PROJECT

1.  See the projects
    
2.  Coordinate the projects
    
3.  Empower the project 
    

  

coordinate all the things - vs -  offer an approach that says people of good intent are ultimately working on one, highest "meta project", and should coordinate

  

then,

- coordinate the things that need coordination

- facilitate the things that need facilitation

- empower the things that need empowerment

  

Next Steps:

  

Help with coordination efforts: Stacey & Wendy

Create the Questionnaire: Jonathan in the lead

-   Meeting to start.  Working asynchronously 
    

  

Michael Grossman2:43 PM

Putting a sharper point on Jonathan's original question (and forgive me Jonathan is I'm going too far): We are currently marginalizing those who lack financial status, social circumstance,  marketing skills. Do those attributes effectively determine participation in our efforts? Can we build means to counteract that, and include others who are skilled and willing?

  

Vincent Arena2:44 PM

1) Get an "Optimally inaccurate" project form finalized and available for people to add to 2) set up 1-on1 meetings with individuals or organizations that have existing data sets of projects and start to federate/work out interoperability or syncing between some databases

  

Jonathan Sand2:44 PM

design the interviewers' questionnaire

  

Philip Bogdonoff2:44 PM

Pass the hat and start funding one of the restoration efforts immediately.  Add/fund one additional project at every meeting.  Then we would be able to say our efforts are making a difference, have stories to tell, learn from that experience.

  

Jordan Sukut2:44 PM

I think it is important to differentiate the path and steps for map weavers as one group, from the steps that the broadest "group of groups"... It will help contextualize how all the pieces fit together

I think the next steps Wendy and Vincent proposed are approximately right

  

Jonathan Sand2:45 PM

write the interviewer's guild purpose and responsibilities statement. already started work on this one

  

Peter Kaminski2:45 PM

Map Weavers should coordinate with other projects (and help other projects coordinate with them)

  

Marianne Wyne2:45 PM

I like your proposed steps you presented in the beginning, to do the interviews in order to get the data we are currently seeking for the map weavers

  

Jack Park2:45 PM

+1

  

Marc-Antoine Parent2:45 PM

I still think the questions/interviews make sense, but I would like us to hash the questions in the questionaire together; another thing I see is a kind of matching projects with one another with a round of project descriptions. Maybe combine that with questionaire?

  

Peter Kaminski2:45 PM

by projects i mean the current Meta Project projects...

  

Philip Bogdonoff2:45 PM

Here is one worthy effort: [https://amazonia80x2025.earth/](https://amazonia80x2025.earth/)

  

Stacey Druss2:46 PM

What Wendy presented in the beginning of call

  

Marianne Wyne2:46 PM

How can we save the chat here in Google Meets? I'd like to read all this later.

  

Peter Kaminski2:47 PM

Marianne, you can select all and copy, then paste somewhere.  It's a little imperfect, but I don't know of a better way.

  

Jack Park2:47 PM

On a mac, if I do a command A - select all, it becomes possible to copy and paste into a text document.

  

Marc-Antoine Parent2:47 PM

Deduplicating projects on the basis of similarity would make sense then?

  

Peter Kaminski2:47 PM

And pasting into a rich text editor rather than plain text is marginally better.

  

Jerry Michalski2:48 PM

we could start a chapter of [http://awesomefoundation.org/](http://awesomefoundation.org/)

  

Michael Grossman2:48 PM

1.) make initial "hello, I'm _____, I'd like to participate. Here are my skills, interests." VERY easy. Then allow that small act to gain more and more traction and power as it feeds the outputs of mapping.

  

Marc-Antoine Parent2:49 PM

Could we do a similarity map of project descriptions, and ask proposers of similar projects to explain how the projects differ and what they have in common?

  

Marianne - let’s use Forrist’s efforts in mapping and collecting info around reg ag.

  

Jerry: we could start a chapter of [http://awesomefoundation.org/](http://awesomefoundation.org/)

  

Jordan

We should connect other people on this call  to meta project more broadly in order to find the right place for each of the conversations that wanted to unfold today

  

Michael Grossman3:06 PM

I'm not sure where this fits, and I don't think it should be its own separate project, but I want to push the idea of self-identification (a "name-tag" at least, a rich and linked personal profile at most) as a key component  (even a central tentpole) of our databasing, spreadsheeting, interviewing, storytelling, mapping.
