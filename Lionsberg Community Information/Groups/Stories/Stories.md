# Stories

Upon reflection. Stories are our soul. Especially stories reflecting what we are doing and thinking and how we are feeling our way through life. They tell us the truth about who we are. This is a good and wonderful gift. Naturally, it needs to be encouraged, nurtured. So, do you need to be heard? Tell us your truth. Anonymous or private as you like. As single humans and as teams and communities of humans, let's grow huge collections of stories together.

Stories from lots of perspectives show us our human energy and collective intelligence. 

Now imagine applying a little modern know-how and techical wizardry. This can give us a way to watch and to nudge our unfolding collective intelligence, our consensus, our community mind.

Joy and challenge are siblings. Watching ourselves like this can help us manage ourselves better when things might be awkward or tough. Help us see where we are growing towards each other or are in conflict. We are talking about a gigantic web of stories between us that sustain who we are and what we are becoming.

Fast forward into the future. Watching ourselves like this can make us easier to manipulate. Why? Because we will know ourselves rather well and tinkering will be rather tempting. We are talking about a gigantic brain washing machine. Same basic machinery as our current one, media, junk and more meaningless junk. No problemo. Now we feed it a better source of truth, our stories.

Here is an image of how some of our real stories connect around what gives us joy and happiness in meta project:

Perhaps we can do the same thing with our mattermost channels, our meeting notes. And soon, if we wish, have our stories as a map in SenseMaker to guide us in our decisions and relationships in Meta Project. Or to help us work with others to make their projects succeed.
