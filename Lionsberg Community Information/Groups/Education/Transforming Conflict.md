# Transforming Conflict 

We are all human. [[The Common Journey]] is difficult. We all have needs, hopes, triggers, insecurities and concerns that we experience as emotions. 

These emotions sometimes drive us into conflict. 

The [Center for Non-Violent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/) and others have well developed trainings in how to become skillful at transforming conflict.
