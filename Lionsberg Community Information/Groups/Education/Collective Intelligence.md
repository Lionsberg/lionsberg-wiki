# Collective Intelligence

Humans are evolving a new trick. Collective intelligence. Would you like to spontaneously form a group and think enjoyably together about something?

[[Conversational Literacy]] plays a key role. It's an etiquette and a philosophy.

Patience, toleration, providing a safe group dynamic, applying logic, distinguishing fact and opinion. Expertise in these skills takes time to acquire. Do we want to provide gentle training? What does that look like? How will we measure its effect?

Would you like to have a few people around who are already expert at inspiring collective intelligence so they can be present often enough to model how it is done?
