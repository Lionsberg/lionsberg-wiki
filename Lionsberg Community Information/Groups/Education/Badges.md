# Badges
As our membership scales, we might benefit from a mechanism which vetts all new arrivals in a way which makes them easy to match against projects and needs. We can offer people a quest to acquire a **badge** in a specific, universal skill.

On the down side, this can pigeonhole people, ignoring or dismissing valuable potential contributions. How can we avoid this?

Would you be more inclined to pursue training if upon completion you received a badge that conveys to all others that you can be relied upon to perform these skills? Would this list of possible badges and their detailed description and training look like this? What is missing?
