# Badges
As our membership scales, we might benefit from a mechanism which vetts all new arrivals in a way which makes them easy to match against projects and needs. We can offer people a quest to acquire a **badge** in a specific, universal skill.

On the down side, this can pigeonhole people, ignoring or dismissing valuable potential contributions. How can we avoid this?

Let's build a list of possible badges and their detailed description and training:

- [[Collective Intelligence]]  
- [[Conflict Resolution]]  
- [[Conversational Literacy]]  
- [[Curation]]  
- [[Enablers, Advocates and Facilitators]]  
- [[Passions Identification]]  
- [[Project Proposal Template]]  
- [[Skills Evaluation]]
