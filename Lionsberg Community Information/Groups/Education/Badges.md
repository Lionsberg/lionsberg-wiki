# Badges
As our membership scales, we might benefit from a mechanism which vetts all new arrivals in a way which makes them easy to match against projects and needs. We can offer people a quest to acquire a **badge** in a specific, universal skill.

On the down side, this can pigeonhole people, ignoring or dismissing valuable potential contributions. How can we avoid this?

Would you be more inclined to pursue training if upon completion you received a badge that conveys to all others that you can be relied upon to perform these skills? Does this list of possible badges and their detailed description and training look reasonable? What's missing?

- [[Collective Intelligence]]  
- [[Conflict Resolution]]  
- [[Conversational Literacy]]  
- [[Curation]]  
- [[Enablers, Advocates and Facilitators]]  
- [[Passions Identification]]  
- [[Writing Project Proposals]]  
- [[Skills Evaluation]]  

Furthermore, these badges have two levels. One held by facilitators essentially states that the holder can train other or help instill a group. The other form is held by anyone and states that the holder can be relied upon to uphold as best they can that particular skill.
