# Project Proposal Template
When you write a proposal for your project, Bill Larson suggests that these four sections will help a lot.

## Need
Describe the issue that needs to be resolved or problem that needs a solution. Is it a thing to be added or to be removed?
## Context
Layout the current socio-economic context in which the need resides. A community or a person?
## Implications
What happens if we don't put effort into addressing this need.  What or who is in pain? Describe the pain. 
## Solution
Describe the project succinctly and show how it will address the need and bring socio-economic benefit to the community.
