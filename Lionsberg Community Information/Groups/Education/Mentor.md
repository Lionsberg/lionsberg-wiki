# Mentor
Perhaps the most important relationship that a person can have when newly joining a sovereign is with an **expert** who enjoys offering guidance and nurture. This as hugely missing in modern life, and those who are lucky enough to have such a relationship speak of it in glowing praise. Let's create a world in which all of us have at least one such **mentor** throughout most of our lives.

A **mentor** can suggest areas to work on, help make needed resources available. They are trained to be nurturing, healing, a shoulder to cry on, an advocate in promulgating influence. Generally, they are a lifelong friend and expert.

Along the way, a **mentor** may notice that their **apprentice** is showing interest in a different sovereign and asks about it, possibly assisting with introductions into the other sovereign. This helps everyone involved.

Above all else, the **mentor** will likely be most effective and well received when they focus on the relationship with their **apprentice** and the latterâ€™s life goals.
