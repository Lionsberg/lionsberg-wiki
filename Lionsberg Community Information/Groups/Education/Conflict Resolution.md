# Conflict Resolution
We're only human. We have needs that we experience as emotions. These emotions sometimes drive us to act out or aggressively pursue conflict. We could have a place for people to feel safe enough to be vulnerable and tell their truth and accept guidance.

A facilitator for such a safe place will need to have some unusual skills:

- deep listening
- empathy
- insightful reflections
