# Education
People newly arriving into the [[Meta Project]] will be curious about it and about where and how they can contribute. Once they feel oriented enough, they may wish to maximize their ability to contribute by learning relevant new skills. Within each sovereign, specialized skills will likely be needed.

On the down side, this can pigeonhole people, ignoring or dismissing valuable potential contributions. How can we avoid this?

### Badges
We can offer people a quest to acquire a badge in a specific skill.

Badges have two levels. A regular badge states that the holder can be relied upon to perform the skill as best they can. A trainer badge essentially states that the holder can be relied upon to model the skill or to help someone develop it. 

Does this list of possible badges look reasonable? What's missing?

- [[Conflict Resolution]]  
- [[Conversational Literacy]]  
- [[Curation]]  
- [[Passions Identification]]  
- [[Writing Project Proposals]]  
- [[Skills Evaluation]]  

### Social Roles

Badges for these roles convey ability and passion for assisting individuals and groups in their efforts and plans.
