# Passions Identification

In modern life, we identify industry standard skills and provide training, creditation and jobs that require them. This is a top down approach that serves the needs of employers more than those of the rest of us.

Passions are largely ignored. A passion drives us from the inside to do outstanding work that is satisfying. This is a huge ignored opportunity. It seems obvious that global productivity would massively increase if all our passions were engaged.

To give a sense of how passions differ from skills, being a doctor is a skill, enjoying restoring health and delighting at seeing someone recover is a passion.

A person whose passions aren't aligned with an industry standard skill can still contribute a lot. How do we help such an "unskilled" person establish their reliability and contributions?

We could **train** people to work with others to help them **discover, understand and articulate their passions**. What would this training include and how will we measure it?

## Questions
Perhaps such training might simply be to practice asking relevant questions such as these...

- Do you know in detail what your passions are?
- Do you feel that your passions are engaged?
- What resources could you use to nurture your passions?
