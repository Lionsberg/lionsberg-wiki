# Passions Identification

In modern life, we identify industry standard skills and provide training and creditation for them followed by jobs that require them. This is a top down approach that serves the needs of employers more than those of the rest of us.

Passions are largely ignored. A passion drives us from the inside to do outstanding work that is satisfying. To give a sense of how passions differ from skills, being a doctor is a skill, enjoying restoring health and delighting at seeing someone recover is a passion. How much would global productivity increase if all our passions were engaged?

Do you feel that your passions are engaged? Do you know in detail what your passions are?

A person whose passions have no industry standard skill can still contribute a lot. How do we help such an "unskilled" person establish their reliability and contributions?

We could train people to work with others to help them discover, understand and articulate their passions. What would this training include and how will we measure it?
