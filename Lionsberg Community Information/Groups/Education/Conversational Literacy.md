# Conversational Literacy
When all people in a meeting have high conversational literacy, they tend to accomplish a lot together. In contrast, when all people have low conversation literacy, squabbles erupt and ideas are barely heard. So the question becomes how do we train for and measure conversational literacy? How do we train people to do the training and measuring? Do we need facilitators, and how do we train them?

### Important and perhaps vital:

[[Collective Intelligence]] is a big component. The Game B concept of Rule Omega is hugely valuable. Listen for "the signal in the noise" and contribute only what the group needs. Agree when you can and disagree only when you must. Debate is a lot less useful than people think.

### The friction between we and me:

Most of us want to contribute our creativity, insight and passion, assuming that it is either vital to the group or to ourself. Can we train ourselves to refine our discernment of the two and favor the group's needs? It helps to have a clear goal for the group.

### Single topic:

Focusing on one topic at a time helps us feel complete about it. Any single topic can get bogged down in contention and unnecessary detail. A facilitator role may be needed to gently guide the conversation away from tangents and such, towards resolution. Brevity and pauses for reflection are good ways to avoid over-stimulation.

### Vulnerability and honesty:

Occasionally, sensitive topics arise because some of the problems we wish to resolve have deep roots in our psyche. Refreshing insight can sometimes come from deep honesty and some of that is vulnerable to social judgement. We may find it important to know how to request safety and also know how to provide it.

### Recovering from a breakdown:

The term "breakdown" refers to an observation by anyone that things have gone off track. All of the above are suggestive examples. Although egregious breakdowns are rare, would we be more resilient if we knew how to detect, report and resolve them?
