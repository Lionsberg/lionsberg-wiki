# Conversational Literacy
As I understand it, please correct my errors, conversational literacy in a group allows it to accomplish more with more delight and less effort.

In simplest terms, it's just an etiquette. Still, it's a big ask. When to talk and when to go quiet. How to listen. Be respectful. Stay relevant.

It's a philosophy as well. An attitude that we are all creating the same single thing, knowing exactly what it is.

And then there's weaponizing it, a really easy thing to do. Feeling disappointed when someone is not quite pulling there weight.

Probably we need facilitators to guide us and encourage us to mimic them.

How is it different from [[Collective Intelligence]]? It's not really, more two facets of the same thing.

### Listening and talking

The Game B concept of Rule Omega is hugely valuable. Listen for "the signal in the noise" and contribute only what the group needs. Agree when you can and disagree only when you must. Debate is a lot less useful than people think.

### We

Of course you'd like to contribute your creativity, insight and passion, right? Do you know how your piece fits what is being created? Do you want it to fit? Is it clearly stated what is being created?

### Topic

Focusing on one topic at a time helps us finish it. Any single topic can get bogged down in contention and unnecessary detail. A facilitator role may be needed to gently guide the conversation away from tangents and such, towards resolution. Brevity and pauses for reflection are good ways to avoid over-stimulation.

### Vulnerability

Occasionally, sensitive topics arise because some of the problems we wish to resolve have deep roots in our psyche. Refreshing insight can sometimes come from deep honesty and some of that is vulnerable to social judgement. We may find it important to know how to request safety and also know how to provide it.

### Breakdown

The term "breakdown" refers to an observation by anyone that things have gone off track. All of the above are suggestive examples. Although egregious breakdowns are rare, would we be more resilient if we knew how to detect, report and resolve them?
