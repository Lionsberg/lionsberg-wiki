# Conversational Literacy
When all people in a meeting have high conversational literacy, they tend to accomplish a lot together. In contrast, when all people have low conversation literacy, squabbles erupt and ideas are ignored. We probably want the former, so the question becomes how do we train for and measure it? Furthermore, how do we train people to do the training and measuring?

### Skills that are important and perhaps vital for game moves:

- Non-Violent Communication
	- Empathy
		- guess the speaker's emotion and its underlying need
	- Awareness of Needs
		- most of us do not know what we need in the moment
- Rule Omega
	- listen for "the signal in the noise"
	- contribute only what the group needs
- One Topic at a Time

### Skills to enhance remote meetings:

- Brevity is godlike
	- pause and invite feedback?
- Vulnerability and honesty
	- know how to request safety
- Gentle live feedback
	- Emoji usage to shift the speaker's approach so it has more appeal to the audience
    - Code a new zoom-like app that can do it better, more about request than judgement

### Skills for group well being:

- Declaring a breakdown
    - what is the process for getting it fixed?
    - who do we report it to?
