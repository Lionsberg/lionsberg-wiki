# Conversational Literacy
As I understand it, please correct my errors, conversational literacy in a group allows it to accomplish more with more delight and less effort.

Along side [[Collective Intelligence]], we have two facets of the same thing.

In simplest terms, it's just an **etiquette**. Still, it's a big ask. When to talk and when to go quiet. How to listen. Be respectful. Stay relevant.

It's a **philosophy** as well. An attitude that we are all creating the same single thing, knowing exactly what it is.

Do we want some **facilitators** to guide us and encourage us to mimic them?

### Listening and talking

The Game B concept of Rule Omega is hugely valuable. Do you find it easy to listen for "the signal in the noise" and contribute only what the group needs? Do you agree when you can and disagree only when you must? Do you like the idea of doing these things? Does it seem to you that debate is a lot less useful than people think? Would you like to cultivate a preference for curiosity over certainty?

We all want to contribute your creativity, insight and passion. Do you know how your piece fits what is being created? Do you want it to fit? Is it clearly stated what is being created?

**Empathy**, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs, is one of them. **Tolerance** of difference, dissent, disagreement is another. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The following training programs are excellent:

Focus on **relationship** and **connection** is of similar high worth. We are much more than our passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, medical histories. Each time we meet, we learn more about these individual facets. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connections and the more valuable and mature our relationships.

### Topic

Focusing on one topic at a time helps us finish it. Any single topic can get bogged down in contention and unnecessary detail. A facilitator role may be needed to gently guide the conversation away from tangents and such, towards resolution. Are you keen to learn to spontaneously be brief and pause so others can reflect? Do you want to find out if these are good ways to avoid over-stimulating the group?

### Vulnerability

Occasionally, sensitive topics arise because some of the problems we wish to resolve have deep roots in our psyche. Refreshing insight can sometimes come from deep honesty and some of that is vulnerable to social judgement. Would you like to know how to request safety and also know how to provide it?

### Breakdown

The term "breakdown" refers to an observation by anyone that things have gone off track. All of the above are suggestive examples. Do you think we might be more resilient if we knew how to detect, report and resolve them?

### Weaponizing

Do you find it really easy to weaponize it? :) Ever felt disappointed when someone is breaking the rules? Does not calling them on it feel upsetting? As far as I know, all of this is natural and normal. Would you like to become vigilant about your feelings?
