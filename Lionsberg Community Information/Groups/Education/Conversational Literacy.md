- Vulnerability and honesty
- Declare a breakdown
    - what is the process for getting it fixed?
    - who do we report it to?
- Emojis 2.0 usage to encourage speaker to shift verbal approach
    - to request a different approach / audience response
    - use emojis for future requests rather than or in addition to assessments of recent past or present actions
    - or the other alternative is to code an app that can do it better than emojis xD
