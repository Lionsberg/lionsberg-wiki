# Education and Training
Note: This is a mixture of explanation and questionnaire, aimed at people who want to facilitate training.

People newly arriving into the [[Meta Project]] will be curious about it and about where and how they can contribute. Once they feel oriented enough, they may wish to maximize their ability to contribute by learning relevant new skills.

How do we create the environment where newbies can feel welcome, get what they need and are fully able to contribute and have fun doing so? How do we train the people to create this environment?

### Facilitators
As a common resource, an **education and training group** could assemble guidelines and train **facilitators**. Some skills have universal value. All sovereigns could then rely on this common pool of training resources.

### Efficient Communication
**Empathy**, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs, is one of them. **Tolerance** of difference, dissent, disagreement is another. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. These training programs are excellent:

Focus on **relationship** and **connection** is of similar high worth. We are much more than our passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, medical histories. Each time we meet, we learn more about these individual facets. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connections and the more valuable and mature our relationships.

### Sovereigns
Within each sovereign, **specialized skills** are worth a lot. 

Students who work hard at learning will probably absorb most of whatever high-quality training material is freely available (or reasonably priced). Expanding on this, mentors or classrooms can offer something more personal and effective, such as the following.

Do we want to [[Badges|measure]] this? Is it possible? Harmful? What kind of training would work for most of us?
