# Education and Training
Students who work hard at learning will probably absorb most of whatever high-quality training material is freely available (or reasonably priced). Expanding on this, mentors or classrooms can offer something more personal and effective, such as the following.

Within each sovereign, **specialized skills** are worth a lot. Who better than a member of the sovereign can provide the insight and experience to describe these skills, explain how they are measured, prepare teaching materials and train the teachers? 

As a common resource, an **education and training group** could assemble guidelines and train **facilitators** ... meta-level trainers.

Some skills have universal value. **Empathy**, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs, is one of them. **Tolerance** of difference, dissent, disagreement is another. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The training programs offered by the center for non-violent communication are excellent resources.

Focus on **relationship** and **connection** is of similar high worth. We are much more than our passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, physiological variances. Each time we meet, we learn more about these individual facets. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connections and the more valuable and mature our relationships.

Do we want to [[Badges|measure]] this? Is it possible? Harmful? What kind of training would work for most of us?
