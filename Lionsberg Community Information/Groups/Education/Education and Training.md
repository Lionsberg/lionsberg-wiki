# Education and Training
Students who work hard at learning will probably absorb most of the material made freely available (or reasonably priced) through high-quality training. This can be made more personal and effective with the following.

Within each sovereign, **specialized skills** are worth a lot. Who better than a member of the sovereign can provide the insight and experience to describe the skill, explain how to measure it, prepare teaching materials and train the teachers? 

Occasionally a sovereign may ask for general guidance. For this, the **education and training group** may choose to assemble guidelines and train **facilitators** ... meta-level trainers.

Some skills have universal value. **Empathy**, the ability to accurately guess another's feelings or needs, is one of them. **Tolerance** of difference, dissent, disagreement is another. The rewards that accrue from learning these skills are easily discerned and felt. The training programs offered by the center for non-violent communication are excellent resources.

Focus on **relationship** and **connection** is of similar high worth. We are much more than our passions and skills. We have unique experiences, childhood traumas, physiological variances. Each time we meet, we learn more about these individual facets. The more we pay attention, the deeper our connections and the more valuable and mature our relationships.

Do we want to [[Badges|measure]] this? Is it possible? Harmful? What kind of training would work for most of us?

**Collective intelligence**, where a group of people think together for any of several goals: identify a problem, solve a problem, ask good questions, curate information. A set of skills useful for this include patience, toleration, listening for what the speaker is not so good at saying, adding only what is missing, providing a safe group dynamic, applying logic, distinguishing fact and opinion, retaining relevance. Expertise in these skills takes time to acquire. Can we provide gentle training for them? What does that look like?
