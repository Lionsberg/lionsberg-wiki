# Welcomer
People newly arriving into the [[Meta Project]] will be curious about it and about where and how they can contribute. A greeter can assist with this.

Imagine not knowing what you now know. Would you like to be greeted by someone who can act like a normal person, help you feel included in their day?

Is this really a situation for which we want a static website or something ai-driven?

Do enough people feel called to be a greeter? If not, is there something we can do to make it more attractive? Is the name an unattractive one?
