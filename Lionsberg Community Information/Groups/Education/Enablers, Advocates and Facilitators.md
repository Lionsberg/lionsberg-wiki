# Enablers, Advocates and Facilitators
Hierarchal organizations with a commander or leader in the top-most position are standard for the old world way of organizing human activity. It has many drawbacks. Such a top-most person can be creul, unethical, myopic, unimaginative, impractical, selfish. As we build our social architecture, we want to avoid such disasters.

Are councils a good alternative? They can be slow to make decisions and may not guarantee all relevant ideas will be given due consideration.

Training for this top-most role will ideally give people and councils the skills and insights to enable individuals, advocate for them (resources and connections), and facilitate group discussions and activities.

Can we assemble here some good training content? At minimum, some guidelines for such content?

### Facilitators:

During meetings, do we want to keep the topic focused and ensure its efficient closure? Do we want the goal (agenda, framing, purpose) to be scintilating and clearly stated, at the start or any time it fails to give us focus? Would we be well served with a concise purpose statement for all of the following?

1. the overall [[meta project]]
2. each individual project
3. each meeting
4. each asynchronous message channel
5. each wiki page

### Advocates:

As each of pursue whatever we are called to, would we appreciate the assistance of someone who could aid us, help us connect to or acquire resources?

### Enablers:

Do you know how to assemble a pragmatic plan to carry out your intentions? Do you know what resources will be needed? Do you have anyone who can advise you to improve your plan, vision, activity? Do you know how to measure your progress?

### These six steps are from Jordan about leadership:

1. Articulate the Vision / Intention
2. Analyze existing reality / forces / conditions
3. Identify and contact WHO you need to help cross the chasm between step 2 and the better and higher future state?
4. Write a Plan of Action, vett this plan with wise advisors
5. Act out the plan
6. Continuously improve the Quality of Vision / Analysis / Engagement / Planning / Action as you iterate towards the Goal
