# Enablers, Advocates and Facilitators
Hierarchal organizations with a commander or leader in the top-most position are standard for the old world way of organizing human activity. It has many drawbacks. Such a top-most person can be creul, unethical, myopic, unimaginative, impractical, selfish. As we build our social interactions and processes, we want to avoid such disasters. On the other hand, councils can be slow to make decisions and may not guarantee all relevant ideas will be given due consideration.

Training for this top-most role will ideally give people and councils the skills and insights to enable individuals, advocate for them (resources and connections), and facilitate group discussions and activities.

Can we assemble here some good training content? At minimum, some guidelines for such content?

Here are some steps from Jordan:

1. Articulate the Vision / Intention
2. Analyze existing reality / forces / conditions
3. Identify and contact WHO you need to help cross the chasm between step 2 and the better and higher future state?
4. Write a Plan of Action, vett this plan with wise advisors
5. Act out the plan
6. Continuously improve the Quality of Vision / Analysis / Engagement / Planning / Action as you iterate towards the Goal
