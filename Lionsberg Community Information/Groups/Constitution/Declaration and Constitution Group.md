# Declaration and Constitution Group
Higher level, simple, broad statement of intent expectation of behavior, improves growing and including others, fewer specifics and nuanced points of debate, less buraeucracy. 

Flexibility and experimentation are what we need right now as we start this. General frameworks that create the safety and establish the boundaries, in which we can learn together. Once we have that, we build a mechanism for improving it, to progressively harden and codify what we validate.

Let's describe our purpose and goal. Organize so we can focus. Choose only a few goals at first, increases our effectiveness, our power. We want to trust our government to not lead us astray. Democracy is bad for minorities. Integrate justly and wisely everyone's efforts and resources. Checks and balances protecting our ideals. Hear all voices. Be able to take timely action. Consider future generations. 

Milestones for building our constitution. Structures through which groups inform the whole and vice versa. Identify types of engagement: tight vs. loose. Differentiate ourselves to be attractive to all the money out there looking for ways to invest. Hybrid legal structure. Intention and values.
