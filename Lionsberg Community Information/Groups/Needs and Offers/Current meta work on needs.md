# Current meta work on needs
Catalist team is working on implementing a needs tracker. During our conversation (Vincent Arena and Jonathan Sand on 2022-08-09), we worked out some visual details and discussed the following:

- schema review
- ways to add a new need:
    - plus button with a form
    - plus button inside or next to a need to add a "sub need"
    - someone posts in chat, then this need is later approved
    - plus button at bottom of form (similar to airtable's interface)
- how to we mark a need as "in holding area"
    - checkbox (boolean yes/no)
    - Status defaults to "Draft/Holding/Proposed"
- source (chat, mattermost, manual entry)
    - can be used to filter
    - can also be used to go back to the source
- sort order
    - handle later
    - or do wierd shit like [group\\sort, group2\\sort2]
    - or copy and paste the need (if it's being fufilled by a different team)
