# Infrastructure Group
During our early phase, we are putting most of our effort into creating groups to focus on a few important aspects of the [[Meta Project]]. Several people have suggested we have a group which looks at what kinds of infrastructural elements we will need. This group's mandate might include the design and planning for:

1. List of [[Grand Challenges]]  
2. [[Map Weavers Group|Mapping people and projects]]  
3. List of infrastructural [[Needs Tracker|needs]]  
4. [[Badges]] of ability to contribute  
5. [[Metrics of Progress and Contribution]]  
6. Coordination of [[Funding Group|funds]]  
7. Easily navigable [[Hierarchies of Data|graph of hierarchal data]]  

##### A pull plan might look like this
Our end goal: We possess billions of dollars and have hundreds of projects and thousands of people in coordinated action solving all the hard problems. This pulls in the need for a compelling funding invitation, articulation of those hard problems and the projects working to resolve them, assignment of people to projects, metrics of progress. These needs pull for a well organized repository of all relevant data and description that is easy to browse and where nothing is hidden, a core team whose members will assure smooth functioning, resolve issues and workaround obstacles.
