# Hierarchies of Data
As the number of records in any of our data tables grows too big to view in just one or two pages, it will likely help us if we assign categories to each record such that we can view just those few records that share a category. As the number of categories grows too big to display in a small widget, such as a drop down menu, it will likely help us to assemble them in a hierarchy and display it as a tree, for easy browsing.

## editing

Current hierarchal graph tools do a poor job of editing. We need to be able to change wording, relationships, associations, tags, categories and so forth. [Seriously](https://sand-74696.medium.com/edit-d05d18996df7) can do this if it is ported into a web app. This porting can be done in few months.

Why does this matter? Mind maps do this just fine, don't they? Frankly no. Their capabilities are very limited meaning that many individual steps are needed to perform what Seriously can do in one step. This is especially significant for those many-step tasks are performed often. Ease and speed count.
