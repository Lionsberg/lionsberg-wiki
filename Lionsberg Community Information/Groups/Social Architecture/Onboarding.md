# Onboarding
As we scale this up to high levels of enrollment, all current members may need to form onboarding relationships with new arrivals. Video capture of excellent conversations help. Well-written material also helps. Anyone arriving may have been invited or encouraged to join, and from such invitations, new people will have an idea of what they are arriving into. The following stages are likely to be common for all new arrivals:

1. invitation or referral
2. watch a video of (or read about) the big picture
3. meet with a [[Welcomer]] who answers initial questions and helps select a long-term **mentor**
4. the [[Mentor]] helps with coming up to speed (see [[Education|metrics and training for mastery]])  
5. eventually acquire the expertise to be a **mentor** or a **greeter**
