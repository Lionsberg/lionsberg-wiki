# Onboarding
We want lots of new people, projects and companies to join the [[Meta Project]]. The following stages may be a good skeleton of how new people join and contribute.

1. you received an invitation or referral
2. you watched a video of (or read about) the big picture
3. you met with a [[Welcomer]] who answered your initial questions and helps you select a long-term **mentor**
4. you [[Education|train for mastery]] by working with the [[Mentor]]  
5. you eventually acquire the expertise to be a **mentor** or a **welcomer**
