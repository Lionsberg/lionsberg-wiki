# Social Architecture
Through many discussions and much offline effort, the following six components of our social architecture will hopefully fulfill all our needs.

1. [[Identify New Connections]]  
2. [[Recognize Potential Value]]  
3. [[Listen]]  
4. [[Offer Support and Guidance]]  
5. [[Provide Orientation]]  
6. [[Invite or Train Facilitators for Key Roles]]
