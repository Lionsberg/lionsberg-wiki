# Social Architecture
Everyone who is involved in the [[Meta Project]] can expect an extraordinary social experience. We want to be happy, productive, flourishing, friendly. We want to do it all fast and easily.

Why? Because we can.

We can design our social experience, processes and guidance, continually learn and redesign.
