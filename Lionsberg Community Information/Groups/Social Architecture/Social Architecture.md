# Social Architecture
Everyone who is involved in the [[Meta Project]] can expect an extraordinary social experience. We want to be happy, productive, fast, easy, flourishing, friendly; everyone. 

Why? Well, why not? It's not that hard to pull off. Social architecture is about designing our social experience, processes, guidance. How will we design things so we can best go about being human together?
