# Wiki Gardening
Because our wiki is designed to have a broad audience, and will be subject to microscopic scrutiny. we probably want to establish some quality guidelines and measures. Pressumably, our wiki will perform its job best if it is organized, consise, compelling, grammatical, plain english and stylistically consistent.

If we esatablish a team of moderators to vett everything submitted, we will need this team to grow in size to accommodate the inflow rate of new written material.
