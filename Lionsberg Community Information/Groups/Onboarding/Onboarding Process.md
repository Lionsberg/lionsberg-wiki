# Onboarding Process
People working in a **sovereign** depend on relationships with others in that **sovereign**. Dialog is crucial to forming relationships. As we scale this up to high levels of enrollment, all current members may need to form onboarding relationships with new arrivals. Video capture of excellent conversations help. Well-written material also helps. Anyone arriving may have been invited or encouraged to join, and from such invitations, new people will have an idea of what they are arriving into. Jonathan Sand proposes that the following stages are likely to be common for all new arrivals:

1.  invitation or referral
2.  watch a video of (or read about) the big picture
3.  meet with a **greeter** who answers initial questions and helps select a long-term **mentor**
4.  the **mentor** helps with coming up to speed and [[Education and Training|training for mastery]]  
5.  eventually acquire the expertise to be a **mentor** or a **greeter**

Perhaps the most important relationship that a person can have when newly joining a sovereign is with an **expert** who enjoys offering guidance and nurture. This as hugely missing in modern life, and those who are lucky enough to have such a relationship speak of it in glowing praise. Let's create a world in which all of us have at least one such **mentor** throughout most of our lives.

A **mentor** suggests areas to work on, helps make needed resources available. They are trained to be nurturing, healing, a shoulder to cry on, an advocate in promulgating influence. Generally, they are a lifelong friend and expert.

Along the way, a **mentor** may notice that their **apprentice** is showing interest in a different sovereign and asks about it, possibly assisting with introductions into the other sovereign. This helps everyone involved.

Above all else, the **mentor** will likely be most effective and well received when they focus on the relationship with their **apprentice** and the latterâ€™s life goals.
