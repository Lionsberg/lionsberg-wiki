> [!How would you describe our funding model?]

All funds put in stay in. With everyone's efforts they grow. Everyone who contributes to this growth is guaranteed a minimum sustainment stipend, as needed.

Killu wrote a [[KS_2022-06-21-TypesOfFunders|draft overview of different types of funders and parties]] that we likely will be dealing with.

Judith proposes we identify and discuss multiple strategies, approaches, execution, and potential outcomes. Identify various district areas, understand our position as a whole and as subsets of Meta, foster an endowment strategy model for areas of opportunity and work beyond specific current and future initiatives.

In an email, Judith describes an "endowment strategy model‚Äù as our initial framework, with two parts: projects and funding. 1-2 years of projects (individual or team) with specified time frames, scope, complexity and desired outcomes. Will Lionsberg itself be funded and administer everything? Will it matchmake funders to specific projects?

Let's do some pull planning with detailed critical-path goals of what we will accomplish in July. Criteria with measurements and analyses. Models exist and vary across different funding and granting agencies.
