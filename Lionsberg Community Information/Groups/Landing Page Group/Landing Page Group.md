# Landing Page Group
Many have observed that the core wiki material is immense and complicated and have asked for super-simple, gradual, introductory material beginning with a landing page. Our working group is responsible for the following:

1. [[Core Community Resources|a main landing page]] containing a super simple description of this wiki and its proposal
2. a design for expanding from there into gradual, increasingly complex material (below)

## ontologies

If our design relies at first on hashtabs, especially if we use generic ontological terms, and incorporates it all according to generic ontological hierarchies, we might be able to build something intuitive and easy to navigate.
