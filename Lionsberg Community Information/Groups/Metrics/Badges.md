# Badges
As our membership scales, we might benefit from a mechanism which vetts all new arrivals in a way which makes them easy to match against projects and needs. We can offer people a quest to acquire a badge in a small universal skill.

On the down side, this can pigeonhole people, ignoring or dismissing valuable potential contributions. How can we avoid this?
