# Passions Identification

Our industry standards have identified skills and provide training and creditation for them. This hugely misses passions, in the sense that some people pursue skills that satisfy their passions, but most people don't and lots of people do not even know what their passions are. 

To give a sense of how passions differ from skills, being a doctor is a skill, enjoying restoring health and delighting at seeing someone recover is a passion.

Most people have passions for which they either have not developed a skill or for which no specific skill exists. They can still contribute a lot, but most others would not understand that such an "unskilled" person would reliably do so.

We could train people to work with others to help them discover and understand their passions. What would this training include and how will we measure it?
