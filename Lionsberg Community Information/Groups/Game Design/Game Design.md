# Game Design
I wonder if we could begin to discuss design principles, rough architecture, intentions. Here are several proposals. Does anyone have a proposal?

- [[Civilization 2.0]]  
- [[Game Proposal from Bill and Jonathan]] early rough draft
- [Sense Craft](https://sensecraft.garden/)  
- [Terran Collective](http://terran.io)  
- [Stacey's let's have fun together](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/sss-project)  

This page can become an invitation to all people who want to build something and are keen to move this forward.

## Must-Have Attributes
As a guide to our design, I propose that the following be built-in at the core of our game, and apparent at every level. Challenges, additions, likes, welcome. 

- Fun
- Meaningful
- Useful Skills
- Relationships
- Collaboration
- Real World Problems

### Fun
Scientific experiments have concluded that people of all ages are more productive when what they are doing is fun.

### Meaningful
Most games are merely entertaining or occasionally educational. What can set our game apart is that it means something to the player to play it. Meeting and collaborating with other players, solving real-world problems, learning skills rarely taught in our education system.

### Useful Skills
Our education system, with its origins in training soldiers and clerks, has mostly failed to teach us to think, collaborate, empathize, or communicate. This is a rather large opportunity for us tt

### Relationships
Everyone we meet, chat with, work with, has as its context the relationship. The qualities that enhance that relationship enhance the meetings, chats and work. The game ought to help people get the most out of every encounter, providing training, fun and healing.

### Collaboration
When we are not working alone, how we think, talk, listen bestows a lot onto what gets accomplished. The game ought to help us ask the right questions, follow rule omega, communicate non-violently, mostly pull in the same direction. Competition need not always prevail over collaboration.

### Real World Problems
How wonderful to let us sink our teeth into real world problems. Quests offer a fun way to take one on. What if we invent wonderful, amazing solutions? Would we want to keep a short list of unsolved problems? Like, how do we change the education or the political system for something that nurtures more of us to thrive? How do we shift our ego from I to we?
