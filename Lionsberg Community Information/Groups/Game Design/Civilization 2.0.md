# Civilization 2.0

I propose that much of the [[Meta Project]] matches a lot of my game ideas. The main differences is to players to immerse into a virtual reality based on something other than money, emphasizes benefit for all as the core driving force for all activity. Why no money? We take money for granted and fully doubt any other form of currency will produce a thriving society. This game provides an experience of this other form.

Why should the [[Meta Project]] be interested? It offers a lot of goodies. It gives us onboarding, experimenting with processes, gathering data about healthy human activity, learning best practices without real world baggage. 

I've written extensive, carefully organized details about this at [Civilization 2.0 the Game](http://www.game.civilization2.org). Some of it is out of date or could use editing. I tried my heart out to avoid the rediculous. :)
