# Game Proposal from Bill and Jonathan
Game questions. Grand Vision of something. Participate. Cos-play, DnD, MineCraft.

New players need to start out easy. This needs to be explained better. Relationships and problem solving. Competing teams.

**Think tank**. Insight, two page white paper. Pose hypotheticals, wander, training ground for solving real world problems. Pay for a subscription. Excellent think tank input worth paying for.

Crowd funding. Team. Point the way to reliability and profitability. Practical best approach. Presented to the Meta Project. Share the “pot.” 

One of the core notions of the Meta Project is problems and solutions. I propose to create a simple game where real world problems can be submitted by any outside agency (the stakeholder) along with a donation. Members of the game form into teams. One or more teams can commit to solving a problem. The stakeholder determines which team has offered the best solution. A portion of the donation is then given to the team.

Several things besides money will attract players. They will meet people and build deep relationships. These relationships are encouraged to evolve in real life. They learn valuable real-life skills: listening, thinking logically, engagement with new concepts, collective intelligence, empathy, articulating ideas.

Once this game solves enough problems, it will attract more problems and more players. It can easily become one of the front doors for funding the Meta Project.

This is not like Fix Me or private think tanks. Instead it is a training ground for massively crowd sourcing intelligence and solving big problems, and for promoting the idea that normal people can solve them.

At first, we will need players who are good at mentoring new players. This mentoring will be a part of what teams do together. Take time out from the problem to look at skill acquisition and recommend course work. This course work is an integral part of the game, and is essentially the solution to the big problem of filling in what our education system lacks.
