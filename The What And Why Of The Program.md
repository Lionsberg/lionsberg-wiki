# The What And Why Of The Program

The Program Objective - the answer to the question “why build anything" - was defined by the [[Receiver]] in the [[Meta Project Program Statement]], and in a more comprehensive way in the [[The Book of Lionsberg]]. This longer document lays out the Receiver’s initial attempt to forge a complete historical and philosophical understanding of [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]] it matters. 

**_The Program is intended to encompass the total [[Program of Action]] required to get FROM [[Where We Are]], TO [[Where We Are Going]]_**_. ._ 

[[The Lionsberg Meta Guide]] lays out a proven System through which a global community of sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities can forge the functional unity required to succeed, and avoid failure, in the [[Meta Project]]. 

[[Program Development]] deals with the processes adopted and continuously improved to manage the continued development of the total [[Program of Action]].
