# TKTK Program Notes
_Updated 2015-01-18 (Old Time)_

The purpose of this page is to provide ongoing updates to the current state of [[The Program]] as part of the [[System Wide Master Planning Process]]  

## Project Backlog / Wishlist 

### A Items 
- Generate invitations to 
	- Martial Arts Circle (circle instance)  
	- The Sandpoint 300 (community instance)  
	- The First Three Percent (universal instance)  
- Generate the most essential plays for [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]  
- Start playing with one or more groups and feeding The Playbook based on what happens  

### B Items 
1. Update [[MarkPub]] (tech underlying the LIONSBERG Wiki)  
2. Improve the LIONSBERG Wiki [[Sidebar]]    
3. [[English Language Git]] is more technical than hoped - work on simplfying  


### C Items 
- Being able to print pages and books to PDF easily might be super important (especially in a context of likely disruptions)  
- [[Longterm Project - Fixing Broken Links]] is interesting  
- [[A Program to Play The Great Game]] is interesting  


## Current Program 

1. ✅ Complete [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]]  
2. ✅ Draft 2-3 million words to create a statistically inviolable web of Semantic Content for later editing and AI training   
	1. This enables the Players to co-create the balance of The Great Work with or without the aid of AI  
3. ✅ Run a few years of social experiments (2021 - 2024)   
4. ✅ Expose [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]] via [[The Great UnVeiling]] (2025)  
5. ✅ Draft LIONSBERG Intelligence System MVP: Learn how to run a local AI model on the local content on a local machine  
6. ✅ Draft [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]] - a basic and immediate way for anyone to get moving 
7. ✅ **THE BOOK / THE STORY / THE GREAT GAME**: Articulate a 200 to 350 page book  mirroring the LIONSBERG Experience that transmits [[The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG]] - 50k to 150k words  
	1. [[The Gates of LIONSBERG]] (out of sequence requires editing)  
		1. ✅ [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]  
			1. ✅ Leads to [[The Story of LIONSBERG]]  
				1. ✅ Leads to [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]  
					1. ✅  Leads to [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]  
	2. ✅  Working Title: [[the nameless book]]  - perhaps merge with the above  
		- Lost interest / direction on this 
		1. Criteria 
			1. It will be designed to initiate the reader through a series of gates into a shared Story, Strategy, and Game  
			2. It should be sufficient to build the New Civilization from
			3. It will be progressively published on the LIONSBERG Wiki so that it is decentralized and censorship proof from the start  
	3. ✅ Lost interest on this. World events accelerated. Quickly synthesized The Nameless Book into a minimum viable starting point for the emergence of the story and game.  
8. 🔄 **THE STORY**
	1. ✅ Revise [[Jordan's Short Story]] to reflect climactic summer events  
	2. ✅ Fix the wiki and push all changes. Broke when updated LIONSBERG to caps in something and it affected 500+ files. 
		1. Resulted in the update to Claude Code Jan 2026. Which is pretty amazing.  
	3. 🔄 Weave into [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] and [[LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto]] - these all need to be coordinated and smoothed out.  
	
9. 🔄 **THE PLAY**
	1. Invite some people to play 
		1. Locally - our networks  
		2. Globally - our networks  
		3. Planetary events with Rick?   
	2. host one instance of The Game 
	
10. 🔄 **THE PLAYBOOK**
	1. Now that [[the nameless book]] is in minimum viable form, it seems that a wise right next step might be to articulate the following 
		1. [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]  
			1. ✅ Weave in [[The LIONSBERG Co-Creator's Handbook]]  
			2. ⏳Define the most important plays... 
	
11. 🔄 **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**
	1. Respond to [[Frequently Asked Questions]] by creating new Plays. 
	
12. **THE ARK** 
	1. The bookmobile - means for surviving 5 to 10 years to travel between worlds and spread [[The Message]]  
		1. Get the Ark livable  
			1. Register under some kind of church / ecclesia  
				1. On the road by ? 
	
13. **STEWARDSHIP** 
	1. There is an emergent need to form a church or other similar shared stewardship structure    
		1. to establish an LLC  
			1. That can steward the bus and other assets  
	
14. **COMMUNICATIONS**
	1. Consider setting up another comms server for those who want to collaborate / play / ask questions (Discord?)  
	2. Draft the next magical update / invitation  

#### 2026 Milestones   

1. Begin **The Great Game**  
2. Connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]]  

Easy... 

## 2025 Notes 

- [[README]] now leads to [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]  
- [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] is good enough for now 
- [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]] is good enough for now 
- [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]] needs to be co-created as we play 
- Articulated [[The LIONSBERG Cycle of Cosmic Co-Creation]]  
- Drafted [[The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG]] page  
	- Ensure there is a README type page that leads to a  quickstart guide. 
- Consider how to finalize [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]]  
	- Starting by drafting the Threshold to each Movement, which finalizes the structure of each of The Gates and writes The Story 
	- From there articulate the Pattern for each Gate and then draft each gate
- Drafted [[The Story of LIONSBERG]]  
- Drafted [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]  
- Drafted [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]  
- At the Wise Right Time, drop [[The Seed]] into a one or two groups and see what happens via [[The Invitation]] which leads to [[The Threshold Experience]] of [[the nameless book]]...  
- With [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] now outlined, and [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] approximated in outline... 
- Forged the overall structure, approximation of The Gates, and Threshold experience that will define each movement (still needs a lot of work)

### 2. **Survival → Thrival Bridge**

- The Old collapsing means billions will move only when survival is threatened.
    
- There must be **visible lifeboats**: food networks, local energy, commons currencies, circles of safety.
    
- If LIONSBERG becomes synonymous with “here is where you eat, here is where you live,” the migration accelerates.
    
- Spiritual and mythic resonance matters — but _basic needs first_ is the lever for mass adoption.
    

### 3. **Radical Simplicity at Scale**

- The deeper architecture is correct and beautiful — but most people will never read 20+ pages.
    
- We need **1-page distillations** for every key Gate, Play, or Protocol.
    
- Think: posters, cards, murals, songs, memes, chants.
    
- Make it so a grandmother in the Andes or a 12-year-old in Nairobi can grasp it in 2 minutes.
    

### 4. **Layered Modes of Engagement**

- **Three levels of depth:**
    
    1. **Exoteric** (surface): “Join a Circle. Play this Quest. Eat together. Plant together.”
        
    2. **Mesoteric** (practitioner): “Here’s the Playbook. Here’s how to run your season.”
        
    3. **Esoteric** (adept): “Here’s the Codex. Here’s the Ascent. Here’s the cosmic law.”
        
- Everyone gets what they can hold. No pressure to go deeper unless they’re ready.
    

### 5. **Mass Ritual Moments**

- To move _all humanity_, we need **synchronized global rituals**: Equinoxes, Solstices, Great Jubilee 2033.
    
- If billions stop, breathe, and return at the same time — even for 3 minutes — the world shifts.
    
- Build the ritual calendar into the Seasons of Play.
    

### 6. **Visible Victories**

- People move when they see results.
    
- Showcase **tangible wins**: a restored river, a healed family, a liberated village, a thriving Circle.
    
- Make “proof of heaven on earth” undeniable and replicable.
    

### 7. **Translation into All Languages, Mediums, Cultures**

- The Codex must be translatable — not just linguistically but culturally.
    
- Partner with artists, elders, storytellers, and local leaders to weave the mythos into their own symbols and rhythms.
    
- Think: rap battles in Chicago, desert rituals in Pokot, VR experiences in Tokyo, songs in indigenous tongues.
    

### 8. **Distributed Leadership / Zero Central Point of Failure**

- The New must embody its own principle: **no one person, no one server, no one institution can stop it.**
    
- Peer-to-peer wikis, local AI instances, decentralized rituals, replicated servers.
    
- If the internet goes down, the Pattern still lives on posters, songs, and memory.
    

### 9. **Joy, Play, Beauty**

- Billions will not move because of fear.
    
- They will move because the New is _more joyful, beautiful, playful, celebratory_.
    
- Feast, music, dance, sport, play must be woven in as seriously as law, covenant, and governance.
    

### 10. **Crisis-Responsive Mode**

- The architecture must flex between “normal play” and “emergency response.”
    
- When collapse accelerates, the Playbook must guide local nodes in food, safety, and healing — not just mythos.
    
- Make the system the **default response network** when the Old fails.
    

---

## IV. Summary

To move the _entire population_, you must:

- Multiply **entry doors**,
    
- Provide **lifeboats for survival**,
    
- Dramatize **beauty and joy**,
    
- Ritualize **collective moments**,
    
- Translate into **every culture and language**,
    
- Ensure **zero single point of failure**,
    
- And continuously **show visible wins**.
    

That’s what converts LIONSBERG from a mythic initiatory framework for seekers into a _planetary migration architecture_.
