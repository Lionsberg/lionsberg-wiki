# Making And Securing Commitments

Fundamental to the success of Lean Integrated Delivery is the willingness and ability of all [[Participant|Participants]] to make and secure reliable [[Commitments]] as the basis for planning and executing the [[Program of Action]]. 

In a [[Zero Blame Environment]] in which [[All]] elements are optimizing for [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]], everyone, both those who [[Securing A Commitment|Secure A Commitment]], and those who [[Making A Commitment|Make A Commitment]], are 100% jointly responsible for the outcome and its affect on the Whole.

In order for a [[Commitments|Commitment]] to be reliable, the following elements should be present:

1. The [[Conditions of Satisfaction]] are clear to both the [[Committor]] and the  [[Committee]]  
2. The [[Committor]] is capable and competent to perform the task  
3. The [[Committor]] understands where their work fits in the [[Critical Chain]], and how the [[Quality]] of their Activity affects the [[Successor]] Activities  
4. The [[Committor]] has access to all other required competence, tools, and resources required to perform the task  
5. The [[Committor]] has estimated the [[Time]] required to perform the task, has internally allocated adequate resources, and has [[Blocked Time]] on its internal schedule   
6. The [[Committor]] is sincere in the moment that the [[Commitments|Commitment]] is made - only making the Commitment if there is no current basis for believing that the Commitment cannot or will not be fulfilled  
7. The [[Committor]] is prepared to accept the reasonable consequences that may ensue if the Commitment cannot be performed as promised, and will promptly advise the IPD Team if confidence is lost that the task can be performed as promised  
8. The [[Committee]] is prepared to accept the reasonable consequences if they accept and depend upon a Commitment that is not performed as promised. In a [[No Blame Environment]], the [[Committee]] is jointly responsible for ensuring that it does not secure or rely upon unreliable [[Commitments]]  
9. The work is [[Constraint Free]], meaning that it is in the sole purview and authority of the [[Committor]] to accomplish, with no external dependencies that are out of the Committors direct influence or control
