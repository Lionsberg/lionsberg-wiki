# 6.2 The reasons for the limitations of current approaches

One of the main reasons for the limitations of current approaches is the lack of a holistic and integrated perspective, planning, and action. Many current efforts to address the Meta Crisis are focused on addressing specific issues or sectors, rather than taking a holistic and integrated approach that addresses the interconnectedness of the various dimensions of the crisis. This narrow focus on specific issues or sectors ignores the interconnectedness of the root causes of the crisis and leads to suboptimal solutions and missed opportunities.

Another reason for the limitations of current approaches is the lack of long-term thinking. Many current efforts are focused on short-term gains and immediate results that benefit one individual, corporation, tribe, or nation, rather than taking a long-term perspective that prioritizes sustainability, wellbeing and regenerative capacity for all. This short-term thinking leads to suboptimal and flawed solutions that do not address the underlying causes of the crisis and do not ensure a regenerative and flourishing future.

Additionally, the limitations of current approaches are often tied to the dominant paradigm of the current era, which prioritizes self-interested economic growth and individual success over collective well-being and the health of the planet. This paradigm has led to a focus on economic growth, consumerism, socioeconomic slavery, and endless resource extraction, which is not sustainable in the long-term and is a major contributor to the Meta Crisis.

Overall, the limitations of current approaches stem from a lack of holistic and integrated perspective, short-term thinking, and a dominant paradigm that prioritizes economic growth and individual success over collective well-being and the flourishing of the planet. A new vision and plan that takes a holistic and integrated perspective, prioritizes long-term regenerative flourishing, and aligns with a new paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet is needed to effectively address the Meta Crisis.
