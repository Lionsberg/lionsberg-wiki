## Q1 2022

## State as of August 2022

As we began the third 6 week cycle in August 2022, the state was as follows: 

- The [[Provisional Structure]] was in place. 
- The [[Core Documents]] were in a Provisional State. 
- The Patterns of [[Organize and Federate|Organizing and Federating]] had been established. 
- A few dozen people were actively participating, and several dozen more attending, following along, and waiting.  
- Numerous partnership discussions and expansion opportunities were in play  
- The [[Core Infrastructure]] had advanced far enough to begin creating marketplace and economy  
- It was an entirely voluntary effort of good human beings, advancing in goodwill, towards [[The Goal]]  
- We were working on [[Value Creation]], and learning to notice [[Value]] as it was being created in-stride. 
- We were beginning to formalize presentations of [[Value Creation]] - [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]].  
- It felt wobbly. It felt vulnerable. It felt exciting. It felt [[New]]. 
- Some people had grown frustrated or impatient and stepped back. 
- Some people had generated new enthusiasm and stepped forward. 
- We had our first committed and blocked hours to apply to the [[Critical Path]]. 
- We were preparing to establish our first Opportunities, Offers, and Needs Marketplace. 
- We were preparing to engage our first extended Pull Planning session to see ahead into the [[Milestones]] and [[Critical Path]]. 
- We had determined the Core Teams that needed to formalized and structured. 
- We had network nodes representing hundreds of people watching and wondering.
- It was reported that the backbone technological infrastructure we had funded was being leveraged by ~170 impact organizations in ~13 countries  
- Some of the most talented, skilled, and wise people we had ever worked with were surrounding us and investing time, energy, and attention  
- We realized that in order to have a chance to succeed, we need to move beyond the abstraction of the [[Meta Project]] into actually living it out and embodying it through [[Lionsberg]] 

## State as of April 2023 

- Over the next 8 months, we released the energy swirling around the [[Meta Project]] abstraction, and focused energy on finishing enough foundational groundwork that [[The Lionsberg Experience]] could begin. 
- In January, we set a 120 day plan that involved raising funds and resourcing a core team by April 2023. We chose not to begin fundraising, and instead focused on continuing to prepare infrastructure and articulate enough of the Lionsberg Vision, System, and Plan so that a team could begin building and resourcing The Movement starting in May. 
- Drafted Foundational Literature, Including: 
	1. [[Lionsberg Manifesto]]  
	2. [[Lionsberg, Simple and Clear]]  
	3. [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]   
	4. [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]  
	5. [[The Lionsberg Approach to Citizen Led Governance]]   
	6. [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]]
