# Lionsberg History and Inception

## Lionsberg Trust Manifesto 

The [[Lionsberg Trust Manifesto]] describes the origin of the Source Idea for Lionsberg, tracing back to [[Jordan]]'s early childhood. 

## Q1 2022 

- Exploratory [[Meta Project]] meetings begin. 

## State as of August 2022

As we began the third 6 week cycle in August 2022, the state was as follows: 

- The [[Provisional Structure]] was in place. 
- The [[Lionsberg Core Documents]] were in a Provisional State. 
- The Patterns of [[Organize and Federate|Organizing and Federating]] had been established. 
- A few dozen people were actively participating, and several dozen more attending, following along, and waiting.  
- Numerous partnership discussions and expansion opportunities were in play  
- The [[Core Infrastructure]] had advanced far enough to begin creating marketplace and economy  
- It was an entirely voluntary effort of good human beings, advancing in goodwill, towards [[The Goal]]  
- We were working on [[Value Creation]], and learning to notice [[Value]] as it was being created in-stride. 
- We were beginning to formalize presentations of [[Value Creation]] - [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]].  
- It felt wobbly. It felt vulnerable. It felt exciting. It felt [[New]]. 
- Some people had grown frustrated or impatient and stepped back. 
- Some people had generated new enthusiasm and stepped forward. 
- We had our first committed and blocked hours to apply to the [[Critical Path]]. 
- We were preparing to establish our first Opportunities, Offers, and Needs Marketplace. 
- We were preparing to engage our first extended Pull Planning session to see ahead into the [[Milestones]] and [[Critical Path]]. 
- We had determined the Core Teams that needed to formalized and structured. 
- We had network nodes representing hundreds of people watching and wondering.
- It was reported that the backbone technological infrastructure we had funded was being leveraged by ~170 impact organizations in ~13 countries  
- Some of the most talented, skilled, and wise people we had ever worked with were surrounding us and investing time, energy, and attention  
- We realized that in order to have a chance to succeed, we need to move beyond the abstraction of the [[Meta Project]] into actually living it out and embodying it through [[Lionsberg]] 

## State as of Spring 2023 

- Over the last 8 months, we released the energy swirling around the [[Meta Project]] abstraction, and focused energy on finishing enough foundational groundwork that [[The Lionsberg Experience]] could begin. 
- In January, we set a 120 day plan that involved raising funds and resourcing a core team by April 2023. We chose not to begin fundraising, and instead focused on continuing to prepare infrastructure and articulate enough of the Lionsberg Vision, System, and Plan so that a team could begin building and resourcing The Movement starting in May.

## Summer and Fall 2023 

Published additional works, such as: 

1. [[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]]  
2. [[The Lionsberg Blueprint - Manifesto For Worksite Earth 2.0]]
3. [[An Alternative to Apocalypse - The New Covenant]]  
4. [[The Dawn of the New World]]  
5. Other [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] 

Traveled to Barcelona, South Africa, and Dubai. 

Ran a couple more social experiments. Learned some more hard lessons. Shed some more insufficiencies. 

Constructed broadcast capability by connecting an online recording studio out to Youtube, X, and the leading podcast platforms. 

We recorded the first 4 sample episodes and launched them in September 2023 as part of the [[Above The Chaos]] series. 

- [[Purpose, Parenthood, Proper Order, and Legacy - Jordan Nicholas & Bill Larson - EP 1]]  
- [[The Corruption of Church and State - Jordan Nicholas & Bill Larson - EP 2]]  
- [[Our Journey Towards Lionsberg - Jordan Nicholas and Bill Larson - EP 3]]  
- [[Food Security, Chemical Ag Wars, and Planetary Regeneration - Klaus Mager - EP 4]]  
In Q3 2023, as Jordan approached the statute of limitations on the civil rights and corruption claims arising from the destruction of 2019 through 2021 and prepared to weather the storms ahead, he moved his family to a new home base in the mountains of North Idaho, filed a civil rights and corruption lawsuit against the County in federal court, prepared to file bankruptcy to wrap the tens of millions of dollars of claims and counter claims from his old life in a transparent public container, and looked ahead to public broadcasting and resource raising. 

## Winter 2023 / 2024 

During Winter 2023 and 2024, we allowed the last of the energy from the [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] to finish falling to the ground, in preparation for the spring and the start of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

We deeply processed and performed retrospection on all that had been learned during the last 7 years, while discerning the [[Critical Path]] forward. 

[[Jordan]] and [[Peter Kaminski]] learned to publish and published a test book. 

[[Jordan]] was asked to write a shorter book that could manifest in print form, and articulated [[Pass The Flame - Illuminating the Way Beyond the Meta Crisis]]. 

## Spring 2024 - Emergence Begins  

We closed [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] on February 29, 2024, and opened the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] on March 1, 2024.  

After the first [[Lionsberg Invitation]] extended met with a 70% to 80% acceptance rate in early March, a [[New]] starting point was at hand and [[Jordan]] went on the first segment of the Above The Chaos tour to gather additional commitments and support.  

By mid April 2024, Cycle 7 of the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] was completed, demonstrating the viability of [[The Tree]] / [[The Body]] that was emerging from [[The Golden Seed]]. 

From that point on, [[The Story]] will evolve into a [[Story of Stories]] as the [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] coalesce into a unified [[Force For Good]] and collaborate to transform their lives and their world, while [[Passing The Flame]] to [[Future Generations]]. 

## What's Next 

Next, we intend to begin measuring the rate at which we are able to connect up, resource and empower [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The simplest way to measure [[The Movement]] will be to monitor emergence via the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]]. 

Our audacious target is to connect and empower roughly 3% of the population, ~250 Million Co-Creators, by 2026.

We aim to progressively realize this Vision and Ideal by: 

1. Progressively discerning, articulating, and embodying the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]    
2. Broadcasting [[The Message]] to create a field of gravitational attraction 
3. Extending [[The Invitation]] to those who resonate  (Every individual receiving up to 20 invitations during [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] to ensure no one [[Involuntarily Left Behind]])  
4. Connecting, equipping, and empowering [[The Community]] of those who respond via [[The Lionsberg Experience]] and a continuously improving set of infrastructure, resources, services, and support     
5. Forging [[Groups]] and [[Teams]] around [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]]  
6. Co-Creating measurable Impact / Value / Progress in service of [[The Goal]]   
7. Broadcasting [[Stories of Transformation]] to fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]] and grow [[The Movement]]  
8. Ultimately moving the entire population [[FROM the Old TO the New]] within a single generation 

Every individual and group that connects with Lionsberg will gain equal access to [[The Lionsberg Experience]] and the [[Lionsberg Commons]], which will host an ecosystem of continuously improving resources, tools, services, and technologies to help participants rise towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony. 

## Spring 2024 Experiment 

The [[Spring 2024 Experiment]] proved that [[The Invitation]] was resonant (80%+ [[Lionsberg Acceptance Rate]], only one firm "no"), and that the requisite [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] could be achieved. 

Nevertheless the [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] did not become adequately [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], and since [[Jordan]] had restricted himself to only extending the first ~100 invitations, he allowed the energy to dissociate ([[Associative and Dissociative Energy]]). 

## Summer 2024 Processing, UnVeiling and Death 

Through the rest of the summer of 2024, Jordan's Journey finally UnVeiled [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]. 

By October 2024, his [[Old Life]] was over. 

[[Jordan's Final Report]] is here: [[Existential Threat - Reporting Back From Battle]]. 

## November Resurrection and Rebirth 

In November 2024, What We Are Becoming rose from The Ashes... 

[[Above The Chaos]] tells the unfolding Story.
