# Lionsberg History and Inception

## Lionsberg Trust Manifesto 

The [[Lionsberg Trust Manifesto]] describes the origin of the Source Idea for Lionsberg. 

## Q1 2022 

- Exploratory [[Meta Project]] meetings begin. 

## State as of August 2022

As we began the third 6 week cycle in August 2022, the state was as follows: 

- The [[Provisional Structure]] was in place. 
- The [[Lionsberg Core Documents]] were in a Provisional State. 
- The Patterns of [[Organize and Federate|Organizing and Federating]] had been established. 
- A few dozen people were actively participating, and several dozen more attending, following along, and waiting.  
- Numerous partnership discussions and expansion opportunities were in play  
- The [[Core Infrastructure]] had advanced far enough to begin creating marketplace and economy  
- It was an entirely voluntary effort of good human beings, advancing in goodwill, towards [[The Goal]]  
- We were working on [[Value Creation]], and learning to notice [[Value]] as it was being created in-stride. 
- We were beginning to formalize presentations of [[Value Creation]] - [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]].  
- It felt wobbly. It felt vulnerable. It felt exciting. It felt [[New]]. 
- Some people had grown frustrated or impatient and stepped back. 
- Some people had generated new enthusiasm and stepped forward. 
- We had our first committed and blocked hours to apply to the [[Critical Path]]. 
- We were preparing to establish our first Opportunities, Offers, and Needs Marketplace. 
- We were preparing to engage our first extended Pull Planning session to see ahead into the [[Milestones]] and [[Critical Path]]. 
- We had determined the Core Teams that needed to formalized and structured. 
- We had network nodes representing hundreds of people watching and wondering.
- It was reported that the backbone technological infrastructure we had funded was being leveraged by ~170 impact organizations in ~13 countries  
- Some of the most talented, skilled, and wise people we had ever worked with were surrounding us and investing time, energy, and attention  
- We realized that in order to have a chance to succeed, we need to move beyond the abstraction of the [[Meta Project]] into actually living it out and embodying it through [[Lionsberg]] 

## State as of April 2023 

- Over the last 8 months, we released the energy swirling around the [[Meta Project]] abstraction, and focused energy on finishing enough foundational groundwork that [[The Lionsberg Experience]] could begin. 
- In January, we set a 120 day plan that involved raising funds and resourcing a core team by April 2023. We chose not to begin fundraising, and instead focused on continuing to prepare infrastructure and articulate enough of the Lionsberg Vision, System, and Plan so that a team could begin building and resourcing The Movement starting in May.

	2. [[Lionsberg, Simple and Clear]]

	5. [[The Lionsberg Approach to Citizen Led Governance]]

## Wrapping Up the Old Life, and Beginning the New

In Q3 2023, as Jordan approached the statute of limitations on the civil rights and corruption claims arising from the destruction of 2019 through 2021 and prepared to weather the storms ahead, he moved his family to a new home base in the mountains of North Idaho, filed a civil rights and corruption lawsuit against the County in federal court, prepared to file bankruptcy to wrap the tens of millions of dollars of claims and counter claims from his old life in a transparent public container, and looked ahead to public broadcasting and resource raising in Q4 2023.   

## What's Next 

In Q4 2023, we begin measuring the rate at which we are able to connect up, resource and empower [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

We aim to progressively realize this Vision and Ideal by: 

1. Progressively discerning, articulating, and embodying the Spirit, Will, and Intention of God  
2. Broadcasting [[The Message]] to create a field of gravitational attraction 
3. Inviting individuals and groups to federate via Lionsberg (Every individual receiving up to 20 invitations during [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]])  
4. Connecting, equipping, and empowering [[The Community]] of those who respond via a continuously improving set of infrastructure, resources, services, and support   
5. Creating measurable Impact / Value in service of [[The Goal]]   
6. Broadcasting [[Stories of Transformation]] to fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]] and grow [[The Movement]]  

Every individual and group that connects with Lionsberg will gain equal access to the [[Lionsberg Commons]], which will host an ecosystem of continuously improving resources, tools, services, and technologies to help participants rise towards the fullness of their potential and flourish. 

Individuals and Groups will work together to steward and continuously improve The Movement and The Commons that is helping All rise towards their potential and flourish.
