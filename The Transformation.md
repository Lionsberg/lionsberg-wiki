# The Transformation

In the context of Lionsberg, **The Transformation** refers to the individual, local, and collective transformation of our [[Way of Being]] as a human species, within a single generation. [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. It coincides with and *enables* the comprehensive regeneration of [[Society]] and the [[Living System]] on Earth. 

The Transformation is followed by the consummation of the [[New Covenant]] and the inauguration of the [[New Era]], and [[Passing The Flame]] to the rising generations as we advance together into the [[New Millennium]].
