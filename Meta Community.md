# Meta Community
The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[LIONSBERG System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore **Meta Community** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Community of communities", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible communities.

The idea of the [[Meta Community]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our various individual communities, with the conceptual [[Meta Community]] that is big enough to unite us [[All]].  

All of our communities, whether we acknowledge it or not, are part of the total set of communities. The only question is how consciously and competently we are participating in the Whole. 

To connect to our attempt to progressively Realize / Embody this idea, see the [[Lionsberg Community]].
