# Wisdom Council

As a provisional step towards transparency, accountability, and good governance as the System organically grows, a [[Wisdom Council]] is being established. 

The Wisdom Council is composed of 7 to 12 wise advisors. 

Wisdom Council members do not have the obligations of liabilities of official board members, trustees, or directors.

### Function 

The Wisdom Council will hold the space until the Lionsberg General Assembly is formed and functional by: 

- Providing consultative wisdom to the leaders of the various Core Circles  
- Approving candidates for Core Circles 
- Overseeing the System for nominating members to the Lionsberg General Assembly 

### Selection 

- Wisdom Council members will initially be chosen by the Founding Leader. 
- In order to stagger terms, initially 4 members will be assigned to 2 year terms, 4 members to 3 year terms, and 4 members to 4 year terms, after which all terms will be for a period of 3 years.  
- Each Wisdom Council member must meet the [[Qualification Requirements For Core Groups]]. 
- Wisdom Council members can serve multiple terms, but must be re-affirmed at each new term. 
- After the first terms, Wisdom Council members will be selected as follows: 
	- 3 by all Lionsberg Community members 
	- 3 by all chief executive leaders of all system entities 
	- 3 by x
	- 3 by y 

### Sub-Councils 

The Wisdom Council may on its own initiative elect sub-councils and select consultants to assist it in specified, delegated research projects that it deems will be beneficial to the Lionsberg community and the function of the Wisdom Council. 

It may apply to Lionsberg Inc. for grants for such research or outside consultants.
