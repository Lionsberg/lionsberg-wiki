# Wisdom Council

As a provisional step towards transparency, accountability, and good governance as the System organically grows, each [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]] should establish a [[Wisdom Council]]. 

A Wisdom Council is composed of 3 to 12 wise advisors. 

Wisdom Council members do not have the obligations of liabilities of official board members, trustees, or directors.

### Function 

Wisdom Councils function to guide,  protect, and shepherd the emerge of Sovereignties through their [[Lifecycle]].  

They also hold the [[Governance]] space until a full system of [[Self-Governance]] is formally established. 

- Provide consultative Wisdom  
- Review and Advise on significant [[Decisions]] and [[Junctures]]  
- Oversee nomination systems as [[Self-Governance]] is established  

### Selection 

- Wisdom Council members are chosen by the co-creators of each New Sovereignty. 
- Terms: Wisdom Councils are reviewed, reaffirmed and recommitted to every 90 days. 
- Each Wisdom Council member must meet the [[Qualification Requirements For Core Groups]]. 
### Sub-Councils 

The Wisdom Council may on its own initiative elect sub-councils and select consultants to assist it in specified, delegated projects or quests that it deems will be beneficial to the Progress of the Sovereign.
