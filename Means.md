# Means
"Means" are actions, systems, or methods by which a result (or [[Ends|End]]) is brought about. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], all [[Means]] must be perfectly consistent with the [[Ends]] we are trying to achieve. 

This arises from the #principle that the [[Ends|End]] is already inherent in the [[Means]] we employ to achieve it, just as the fruit is already inherent in the DNA of the seeds we sow.
