# Citizen Led Response

The Citizen Led Response is a call to action for individuals and communities around the world to come together and address the challenges facing humanity and the planet. It recognizes that the existing power structures are failing to address the root causes of the [[Meta Crisis]] and that [[Citizens]] must take the lead in developing and implementing solutions.

The Citizen Led Response is guided by the principles and values of the Lionsberg, which emphasize Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Liberty, and right relationship between One and All. Through this approach, [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]], and the [[LIONSBERG System]] that enables it, Citizens can work together to confront and overcome the crises at hand, and co-create a more just, regenerative, and thriving world.

Key aspects of the Citizen Led Response include:

1.  **Empowering Citizens**: The Citizen Led Response recognizes that individuals and communities have the power to create positive change, and seeks to empower them with the tools, knowledge, and resources needed to take individual, local, and collective action.
    
2.  **Collaboration and Partnership**: The response emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnership across the boundaries that have divided us in the past, encouraging citizens to work together across boundaries of geography, culture, politics, and ideology to co-create solutions that benefit everyone involved.
    
3.  **Action-oriented Strategy**: The response is grounded in an action-oriented strategy that provides citizens with a clear and achievable plan of action, allowing them to see the direct impact of their efforts and build momentum towards the realization of the [[New Vision and Plan]].
    
4.  **Regenerative Approach**: The Citizen Led Response promotes a regenerative approach to problem-solving, recognizing that the solutions must address the [[Root Causes]] of the Meta Crisis and co-create a more just and regenerative world for all.
    
5.  **Urgency and Agency**: The response acknowledges the urgency of the situation and encourages citizens to act with agency and purpose in a decentralized and empowered manner, recognizing that the fate of future generations depends on the actions we take today in all parts of the Earth.
    

The Citizen Led Response serves as a powerful call to action for all individuals and communities to engage in the transformational work of co-creating a more just, regenerative, and thriving world.
