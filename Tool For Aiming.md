# Tool For Aiming

1.  Clarify your [[Purpose]]: What is the reason for your existence? What is the big picture that you want to achieve in your life? Write down your answers in a clear and concise statement.
    
2.  Identify your [[Values]]: What are the principles that guide your life? What do you stand for? What are you passionate about? What makes you angry? Write down the values that are most important to you.
    
3.  Create an overarching [[Aim]]: Based on your purpose and values, create an Aim that unites them into a single goal. This should be a clear and compelling statement that motivates and inspires you. 
    
4.  Break down your uniting [[Aim]] into specific goals: Identify the steps that are necessary to achieve your aim. Set specific, measurable, and achievable goals that align with your aim. These goals should challenge you, but also be realistic.
    
5.  Regularly review, adjust, and improve your Aim: As circumstances change, you may need to adjust your goals and your overall aim. As you learn, you will improve your Aim. Regularly review your progress, adapt, and improve as needed.
    
6.  Stay focused on the highest and longest-term [[Vision]]: Keep your focus on the bigger picture and the long-term Purpose, Vision, and Goa. Be willing to persevere through setbacks and failures, and keep your attention on the ultimate aim.
    
7.  Align your Aim with the [[Greatest Good]]: Consider how your aim can contribute to the well-being of others and the planet. Strive to align your personal goals and aspirations with the [[Meta Goal]] of [[Co-Creating]] a flourishing and abundant world for All. 

Remember that aiming is a process, and it may take time to clarify your [[Purpose]], [[Values]], and overall [[Aim]]. Don't get paralyzed. Choose a Good Aim, be patient and persistent, and keep moving forward, step by step. It is hard to steer a parked car, so the important is to choose a Good Aim and start moving. As you advance, you will be able to progressively clarify and improve your Aim as you learn and grow. With a clear aim and a focused mindset, you can achieve great things, even in the face of challenging or seemingly insurmountable circumstances.
