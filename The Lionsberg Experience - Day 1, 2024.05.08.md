# The Lionsberg Experience - Day 1, 2024.05.08

Hello friends and allies, 

Welcome to Day 1 of [[The Lionsberg Experience]]. 

## Where We Are Going 

We are aiming at [[The Goal]]. 

## Where We Are 

We have descended from the abstraction of the [[Meta Project]], reached the Starting Point of the **New Season**, and crossed over into Day 1 of [[The Lionsberg Experience]]. 

## How We Got Here 

The [[Lionsberg Trust Manifesto]] and [[Lionsberg History and Inception]] provide some background on how we get here to Day 1. 

## Our Role 

Our role is to be a servant of [[All]], connecting, empowering, and enabling [[The Process]] through which [[All]] subsequent generations of life can co-create their future. 

## What's Next 

We are going to begin [[The Process]] of inviting [[All]] 8 to 10 billion of us to become co-creators of [[The Future]]. 

Our [[Aim]] is for every human to receive an invitation from someone they know and love during  [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] to join [[The Movement]]. 

As part of joining [[The Movement]], they will receive a 3 year period of training, mentoring, and support to learn and practice how to be and collaborate in this [[New]] Way. 

We are going 

The [[2023 Q2 60 Day Plan]] presents a rough outline of what's next, and will be refined in community over the coming weeks.
