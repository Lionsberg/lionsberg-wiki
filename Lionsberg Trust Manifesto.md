# Lionsberg Trust Manifesto

_Updated March 2023_

This document serves as a "Trust Manifesto" in response to requests from the community. It aims to establish a comprehensive source of information addressing the core questions people have when encountering something new. For additional information, see also [[Frequently Asked Questions]]. 

This document is a [[Work In Progress]].

## Name 

[[Lionsberg]] symbolizes the [[New World]] we are co-creating, the Community nurturing it, and the System bringing our shared Vision into Reality. 

The [[Meta Project]] describes the all-encompassing Program of Action required for humanity to manifest this vision.

## Differentiation 

While the [[Meta Project]] refers to the highest universal level of abstraction, [[Lionsberg]] focuses on embodying the [[Meta Idea]] in our time and place on Earth.

## Source Idea  

[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is the primary steward of the Source Idea, supported by dozens of co-creators. 

## Genesis of the Source Idea

Jordan's pursuit of this idea began at a young age. The Source Idea seeks to realize the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for All - a goal that has remained constant throughout his journey.

Jordan's background in heavy civil infrastructure provided him with valuable experience in understanding an architect's intent, analyzing forces and conditions, and transforming the physical world to bring intentions into reality. 

We are applying this same approach towards the transformation of [[Worksite Earth]]. 


## Corruption and Injustice 

Jordan faced challenges when his naïveté clashed with corrupt power structures within church and state. This confrontation resulted in personal loss and the loss of the companies he was building. 

## The Reemergence of Lionsberg

By early 2022, Jordan and his family had recovered, and the necessary technological backbone was developed to commence the social experiment through Lionsberg. 

In Q1 2022, Jordan began convening meetings to begin to explore the concept of an all-encompassing [[Meta Project]] larger than any one movement, group, or nation. 

## Pattern Integrity

The [[Fundamental Tone]], which unifies all aspects of the System, Pattern, and Community, is [[Love]]. [[Love]] encompasses all other [[Values]], such as Truth, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Goodness, and Beauty.

A level deeper, it is ultimately the Spirit  or Source of [[Love]], or [[God]]. 

## Transformations Over Time 

The [[Meta Idea]] is eternal and unchanging, while the universe and our understanding of it evolves. Lionsberg aims to help [[All]] things elevate and transform themselves towards [[The Goal]]. This [[Meta Goal]] cannot and will not change, even as the strategies and tactics to navigate towards it evolve through the generations. 

## Evolutionary / Transformational Purpose

Lionsberg's purpose is to invite [[All]] things into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]]. The evolutionary goal is the reintegration of the entire human species with the [[Living System]] and its [[Source]].


## Vision of the Future 

As a result of our collective efforts, we envision a future where humanity has transcended division and embraced a [[New Way of Being]], in harmony with [[One Another]], [[One]], and [[All]]. Corruption, injustice, suffering, and oppression will be vanquished, and all individuals will have access to lifelong opportunities to develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish. We will co-create a world where all life flourishes and the [[Universal Symphony]] resounds in harmony with the [[Fundamental Tone]].

The [[Best Possible Future]] is within reach, awaiting humanity's collective decision to work together for the good of [[All]] generations of life and consciousness.

## Where We Are 

We will do our best to keep updated with [[Where We Are]] on the [[Lionsberg History and Inception]] page. 

## Investments Prior to  2023

The development work through 2022 has been financed solely by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] through the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) public charity, resulting in a pure, transparent, and publicly accountable structure with no obligations but to [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Dozens of people have invested time, ideas, and expertise to help advance the platform and community. 

## The Path Forward

The journey towards the [[Best Possible Future]] is paved with transformation, collaboration, and unity. It will require the collective effort of every individual, every community, and every nation, as we walk the path together, hand in hand, guided by our shared principles and values.

## Conclusion

The Lionsberg Trust Manifesto is more than a declaration of history and principles; along with the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]], it is an invitation to join a global movement dedicated to creating a brighter future for all. We acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead, but we remain steadfast in our belief that together, united by our shared values and aspirations, we can overcome the obstacles and transform our world.

As we embark on this journey, let us draw strength from one another, fueled by our collective determination and unwavering commitment to the [[Best Possible Future]]. With every step, let us remember the power of unity, love, and wisdom, for it is in these qualities that we will find the key to unlocking the full potential of our shared human experience.
