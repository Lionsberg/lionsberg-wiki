# Who We Are Becoming

We are becoming [[Whole]]. We are becoming [[Wellness|Well]]. We are becoming one. We are gathering our [[Selves]] up and integrating our [[Selves]] into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. We are moving towards [[Oneness]] through [[Love]]. 

[[That Which Is Longing To Emerge]] is (something like) [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

[[That Which Is Longing To Emerge]] is (something like) a universal body, in which each part is playing its unique role as the [[Whole]] advances towards [[The Goal]]. 

[[That Which Is Longing To Emerge]] is (something like) a exquisite tapestry, in which all the unique colors and elements are woven together by the [[Golden Thread]] into one.  

[[That Which Is Longing To Emerge]] is (something like) a [[Universal Symphony]], in which all the unique instruments are tuned to the [[Fundamental Tone]] and playing their individual parts in [[Harmony]]. 

In order for [[All]] to become [[Whole]], We each must become [[Whole]].  

In order for [[All]] to [[Flourish]], We each must [[Flourish]].  

In order for [[All]] to become [[One Integrated Embodiment]], We each must become [[One Integrated Embodiment]]. 

In order for us [[All]] to become [[Who We Are Becoming]], we must [[Help One Another]], [[Individually And Collectively]], become our [[True Self]].
