# 3.4 How the Players of The Great Game Collectively Decide What Is Most Important and Valuable to Do Next

As a [[Holofractal Pattern Language]] applied across cosmic scales, LIONSBERG cannot make governance and resource allocation decisions centrally for any world, but rather relies on the distributed intelligence, sovereignty, and agency of the Players of The Great Game. 

In practical terms in any local world, what LIONSBERG as a whole is working on at any given time is the total sum of all the [[Quests]] being undertaken by the distributed array of [[Individuals]], [[Circles]], [[Communities]], [[Guilds]], [[Bioregions]], etc. in that world.  

This process emerges and unfolds similar to the way that bees and ants scout out the most [[Valuable]] opportunities and threats, dance and dialogue, and then allocate collective energy towards the Highest and Best available options surfaced in Community at each [[Holofractal]] level of analysis. 

More concretely, this process usually occurs through the mechanisms of [[Dialogue]], [[Discernment]], and [[Consent]] around [[Proposals]] made at each [[Holofractal]] level. 

Individuals may make [[Proposals]] to the Circles they are engaged in, and Circles may make [[Proposals]] to the [[Higher Order]] superorganisms they are a part of ([[Communities]], [[Guilds]], [[Bioregions]], Worlds, etc.). 

Once [[Decisions]] are made, they are constantly tested against [[Reality]] to ensure that they continue to be the [[Wise Right Thing]], and to see how they can be improved. The Whole is constantly shifting and morphing as a consequence of the daily, weekly, and seasonal micro-decisions being made by [[Autonomous]] Individuals, Circles, and Groups. 

In the language and story of The Great Game, as we navigate through [[The Wilderness]] on [[Our Shared Journey]] towards [[The Promised Land]], we do not pretend that [[Reality]] will be easy or smooth to traverse. It requires constant [[Discernment]], [[Wisdom]], [[Governance]] and [[Navigation]].  

The [[System Wide Master Planning Process]] is designed to ensure that all Individuals, Circles, and Localities have a clear picture of the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]], but it must be "played" into reality across all levels of analysis.
