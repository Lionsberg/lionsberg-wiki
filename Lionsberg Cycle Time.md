# Lionsberg Cycle Time

The Lionsberg Cycle Time refers to the [[Rate]] at which [[The Body]] assembles itself. The term Cycle refers specifically to the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], which act like Growth Rings on [[The Tree]] emerging from [[The Golden Seed]]. 

## Milestones

There are 48 Cycles of Growth required to mathematically encompass [[All]] 8 to 10 billion of us. The [[New Vision and Plan]] call for [[All]] to be reached within [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 

7 years = 365 weeks, so on average each cycle of growth can take up to 7.6 weeks. 

However our [[Milestones]] call for reaching 3% of the population, ~250 million, by 2026. 

250 Million is reached with the completion of the 40th Cycle of Growth. 

To accomplish this by 2026, a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of no more than 3.66 Weeks / Cycle is required for the first 40 Cycles. 
(March 2024 to December 2026 = 34 Months x 4.3 Weeks / Month = 146 Weeks Divided by 40 Cycles = 3.66 Weeks / Cycle).

After this has been accomplished, the decentralized [[Force For Good]] has (365 weeks - 146 weeks = 219 weeks remaining) to accomplish the remaining 8 Cycles of Growth. 

[[The Movement]] has a significant decision to make on whether it progresses this slowly, or chooses to capture the [[2024 Opportunity]] (see below under "Remaining")

## Completed 

- [[Lionsberg History and Inception]]  
- Cycle 1: 2 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 2: 3 Co-Creators  - 1 Day  
- Cycle 3: 5 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 4: 8 Co-Creators (0.0000001%) - 2 Days  
- Cycle 5: 13 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 6: 21 Co-Creators - 5 Days  
- Integration (No Invitations): 3 Weeks 
- Cycle 7: 34 Co-Creators - 2 Weeks (7 Cycles in 7 Weeks) 
- Cycle 8: 55 Co-Creators - 4 Weeks 
 
## In Progress 

Cycle 9: In Progress - See [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]]  
Successful completion requires adding 34 Co-Creators (89 Co-Creators (0.000001%))   
Invitation Pool: ~140 +  

## Remaining 

**As of the completion of Cycle 8**: 
- Remaining Cycles to 3% (~250 Million): 32 Cycles      
- Remaining Weeks: 146 - 11 = 135 Weeks  
- Minimum Required Cycle Time = ~4.2 Weeks  

**2024 Opportunity**
- If we pulse the movement quickly, we can have enough enlightened co-creators standing behind the [[New Vision and Plan]] by November 2024 to sweep the executive branch in the United States Election.  
	- We would have an independent US President and several governors among The Movement  
	- We could dramatically mitigate the existential threat of an AI + Thermonuclear WWIII, and leverage the logistical capacity of the United States and allies for aid and relief efforts instead (swords to ploughshares / weaponry to livingry)     
	- By 2026 we will have 250 Million connected and empowered co-creators standing behind the [[New Vision and Plan]], enabling the next round of realignment in the United States and around the world.       
	- By 2027 (1/2 way through [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]) we would have access to the constitutional amendment mechanisms to reset the American Experiment, disband the corrupt bureaucracies, decentralize power, and realign it in service of [[The Goal]]     
	- This would enable us to structurally solve many issues at the root of corruption and mis-incentives around the world, while mitigating the risk of a [[Collapse]] into world war, [[Chaos]], or [[Tyranny]]    
- This merely requires that each person begin identifying and onboarding one other person a week to The Movement. It is entirely possible. Do we care enough to cause this to happen?

Status: 
- To accomplish the minimum plan of 250 million connected and empowered leaders by 2026, the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] can advance as slow as monthly. 
- To sweep the US election in 2026, it must continue to advance on average weekly.
