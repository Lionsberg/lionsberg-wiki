# Lionsberg Cycle Time

The **Lionsberg Cycle Time** refers to the [[Rate]] at which [[The Body]] assembles itself. Each cycle represents a step in the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], akin to the growth rings of [[The Sacred Tree]] unfurling from [[The Golden Seed]].

## Milestones

The completion of **48 Cycles of Growth** is mathematically required to encompass [[All]] 8 to 10 billion people on Earth. The [[New Vision and Plan]] call for this to occur within [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]].

With 7 years equaling 365 weeks, each cycle of growth can average **7.6 weeks** to remain within the timeline.

However, to achieve **[[The 2026 Milestone]]** of reaching **3% of the population (~250 million)**, the first **40 cycles** must be completed within **23 months** assuming a February 2025 starting point. 

### Required Cycle Times

1. **Spring 2024 Experiment:**  
    During this phase, a cycle time of **3.66 weeks per cycle** (140 weeks for 40 cycles) was required. In comparison: 
    
    - **8 cycles** were completed in approximately **11 weeks** for an average cycle time of **1.4 weeks per cycle**.
    - The [[Lionsberg Acceptance Rate]] for [[The Invitation]] exceeded **80%**, affirming the scalability of the model.
2. **2025 - Season 1 - Rising From The Ashes:**  
	Entering February 2025, We have only 23 months remain to reach **3% of the population (~250 million)** by **2026**.

	- This milestone requires a more rapid average cycle time of **17 days per cycle** for the first 40 cycles.
	- The 2024 experiment proved this is possible.

## Experiments and Context

1. **2025 - Season 1 Experiment:**  
    The unfolding season of [[2025 - Rising From The Ashes]] began in February 2025. For updates, see [[Above The Chaos]] for progress and lessons as We learn them together.
    
2. **Spring 2024 Experiment:**  
    Details of the remarkable growth and engagement during this phase are documented in [[Spring 2024 Experiment]].
