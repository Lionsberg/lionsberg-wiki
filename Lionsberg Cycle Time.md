# Lionsberg Cycle Time

The Lionsberg Cycle Time refers to the [[Rate]] at which [[The Body]] assembles itself. The term Cycle refers specifically to the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], which act like Growth Rings on [[The Tree]] emerging from [[The Golden Seed]]. 

## Milestones

There are 48 Cycles of Growth required to mathematically encompass [[All]] 8 to 10 billion of us. The [[New Vision and Plan]] call for [[All]] to be reached within [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 

7 years = 365 weeks, so on average each cycle of growth can take up to 7.6 weeks. 

However our [[Milestones]] call for reaching 3% of the population, ~250 million, by 2026. 

250 Million is reached with the completion of the 40th Cycle of Growth. 

## Required Cycle Times

For the [[Spring 2024 Experiment]], a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of 3.66 Weeks / Cycle was required for the first 40 cycles (140 Weeks / 40 Cycles). Against this requirement, 8 cycles were completed in ~11 weeks, for an average cycle time of 1.4 Weeks / Cycle, with a [[Lionsberg Acceptance Rate]] of [[The Invitation]] at 80%+. 

Entering [[2025 - Season 1]], with only 24 months remaining to reach 3% of the population, a more rapid cycle time of 18 Days / Cycle was required.
