# The Lionsberg Critical Path

By 2017, we had discerned that the [[Critical Path]] likely ran through three primary issues: 

1. A Superordinate Legal and Governance System That No One Owned  
2. A Backbone Technology Platform  
3. A Collective Mind / Consciousness 

Knowing that the Backbone and Mind would likely need to be funded in a [[Way]] that no one owned, and could be stewarded across multiple generations for the [[Good]] of [[All]], we began the global search as outlined above that led to the instantiation of the first legal and governance structure - see [[Provisional Structure]]. 

We then brought together lifetimes of work and funded through the platform the creation of the backbone technology platform. 

We then partnered to instantiate the basis of a collective memory and mind that could store and access information across a distributed global network, without requiring access to the internet or cloud in case of a systems failure.
