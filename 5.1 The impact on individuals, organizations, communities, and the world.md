# 5.1 The impact on individuals, organizations, communities, and the world

The consequences of the Meta Crisis are far-reaching and impact individuals, organizations, communities, and the world as a whole. 

On an individual level, the Meta Crisis can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and a sense of powerlessness. It can also contribute to physical and mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, and depression.

At the organizational level, the Meta Crisis can lead to existential threats to existing business, funding, and operational models as the environment rapidly shifts. 

At the community level, the Meta Crisis can lead to social unrest, conflict, and violence. It can also exacerbate existing social inequalities, such as poverty and discrimination, and create new ones. The Meta Crisis can also disrupt traditional ways of life and harm cultural and spiritual traditions.

At the global level, the Meta Crisis can lead to destabilization and insecurity, as well as damage to the global socioeconomic systems and international relations. It can also have severe environmental consequences, such as environmental degradation, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.

The long-term consequences of the Meta Crisis are even more concerning, as they have the potential to threaten the very survival of humanity on earth. If left unchecked, the Meta Crisis could lead to the collapse of social, economic, and political systems, and the destruction of the natural world, for instance through a world war in which nuclear and artificial intelligence weapons are deployed. 

The urgency of addressing the Meta Crisis cannot be overstated. It requires an immediate and coordinated response from individuals, communities, and governments around the world. It requires a New Vision and Plan that is comprehensive, holistic, and grounded in a deep understanding of the root causes and contributing factors of the Meta Crisis.
