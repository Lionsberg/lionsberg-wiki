# I.B. Importance of Resurrecting and Rekindling the Spirit of America

The spirit of America is embodied in the principles of liberty, justice, equality, and free enterprise that have long been at the heart of our nation. These principles have inspired us towards greatness and have called us to be a shining light to the world.

However today, this spirit is threatened. We have lost our way and are in danger of forgetting the values that once defined us as a nation. 

Political division and self-interest have replaced the sense of shared purpose and unity that once characterized our nation. We have allowed ourselves to become divided, and as a result, we have lost the strength and confidence that come from standing together.

The spirit of courage and enterprise that once drove us towards new frontiers is waning. We have become uncertain and anxious, and in doing so we have lost the determination and positive energy that flow from progressing together towards a better future. 

It is imperative that we resurrect and rekindle the spirit of America, not just for the future of our children and grandchildren as Americans, but for the future of all God's children around the world. This nation has been entrusted with a unique and important role in standing up to oppression, injustice, and totalitarian control, and shaping the world for the better. The health and vitality of our spirit is essential if we are to continue to fulfill this crucial responsibility.

Therefore, it is essential that we reclaim our heritage as a beacon of hope, freedom, and strength in the world. We must come together as one people, bound together by our love for all people and all creation, and our commitment to the values that have guided us in our best moments.

This campaign is a call to action. Only by rediscovering the very best of what the spirit of America aspires to represent can we hope to overcome the challenges we face and create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.
