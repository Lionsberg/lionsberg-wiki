The Pillars of Society refer to the four interconnected pillars that make up the foundation of a healthy and thriving society. These pillars are [[Governance]], [[Economy]], [[Society]], and [[Spirituality]].

1.  **Governance**: The governance pillar refers to the systems, structures, and processes through which society is governed and. navigated towards its Goals and Values. This includes institutions like governments, courts, and regulatory bodies, as well as the laws, policies, and regulations that guide their operation. It also includes the self-governance of individuals, families, groups, tribes, and nations at every fractal level. The governance pillar is essential for ensuring fairness, justice, and accountability in society, and for protecting the rights and well-being of all citizens in all places and times.
    
2.  **Economy**: The economy pillar refers to the systems, structures, and processes through which society produces, distributes, and consumes goods and services. This includes businesses, markets, financial systems, and other economic institutions, as well as the laws, policies, and regulations that guide their operation. The economy pillar is essential for creating prosperity, provisioning families and communities, and ensuring that basic needs are met for all members of society.
    
3.  **Society**: The society pillar refers to the social structures and norms that shape human interaction and behavior. This includes families, communities, educational institutions, and other social institutions, as well as the cultural, social, and ethical values that guide their operation. The society pillar is essential for fostering social cohesion, promoting creativity and beauty, and ensuring that everyone has a shared sense of belonging and purpose.
    
4.  **Spirituality**: The spirituality pillar refers to the inner life of individuals and communities, including their values, beliefs, sense of meaning and purpose, and their relationship with the Divine. This includes religious and spiritual institutions, as well as practices like prayer, meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection. The spirituality pillar is essential for fostering inner growth and well-being, for guiding individuals and communities towards a sense of connection and purpose beyond themselves, and for inviting all Creation into right relationship with one another and our Source.
    

Together, the Pillars of Society provide the foundation for a healthy and thriving society, one that is able to meet the needs of all its members and foster a sense of connection, purpose, and meaning. By prioritizing the well-being of all individuals and communities, and ensuring that each of the Pillars is strong and functional, we can create a world that works for all.
