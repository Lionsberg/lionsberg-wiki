# Principles
*Updated April 27, 2025*

In LIONSBERG, **Principles** represent the core guiding truths that form the foundation for individual and collective action. These Principles are not mere ideals but immutable, universal laws that govern [[Life]], [[Growth]], and [[Co-Creation]] within [[The Cosmos]]. They act as the bedrock upon which the entire LIONSBERG framework is built, guiding humanity toward higher levels of [[Consciousness]], [[Purpose]], and [[Unity]]. Principles provide guidance and direction for embodied behavior, helping [[Practitioners]] make decisions that are consistent with their central animating [[Spirit]], [[Ethos]], [[Values]] and [[Goals]].

LIONSBERG’s Principles reflect the Divine [[Logos]] and are integral to shaping the **[[Way of Being]]** that allows individuals to live in alignment with their highest [[Potential]] and with the Divine [[Flow]] of [[InterExistence]]. They represent **core metaphysical truths** that are universally applicable, transcending time, space, and dimension. By intentionally adhering to these Principles, We engage in a harmonious dance with the Universe and its [[Source]], unlocking ever greater [[Meaning]], [[Creativity]], [[Wellness]], and [[Flow]] in our lives.


# Guiding Principles

There is no definitive list of guiding principles for life and society. A proper mode of being and doing must be guided not by a fixed dogmatic articulation, but by Spirit. 

Depending on how broadly or narrowly each principle is defined, a list of guiding principles could be one, several, several dozen, several hundred, or several thousand. 

Because universal principles flow from one Spirit, they are not mutually exclusive, and they all interconnect and overlap in various. They are like parts of one integrated personality. 

It is the Spirit and Consciousness of each individual that must mediate between a potentially infinite array of principles, situations, beings, and patterns of action in order to Manifest the pattern of action most appropriately suited to that person, time, and place. 

## Central Animating Spirit or Ethos 

The [[Central Animating Spirit]] or [[Ethos]] of an individual, community, or society refers to the unifying Spirit that gives rise to the underlying [[Values]] and [[Beliefs]] that shape its [[Culture]] and [[Way]] of life. It is the driving force behind the actions and behaviors of the people within that society, and helps to create a sense of shared purpose and identity.

Each individual unit of society is inexhaustibly complex, with a complex array of interrelated beliefs, values, principles, and drives, many of which are opaque or subconscious. This is also True for [[The Collective]]. 

Because the complex and interrelated hierarchy of principles and drives cannot be fully articulated, it is often better thought of and grappled with as a 'guiding spirit' or 'essence' that is not static, but living, moving, and Progressively Articulating ItSelf over Time. 

Because the central animating spirit cannot be fully articulated, to know it we must look to the behaviors and outcomes manifesting as a consequence of it. *We will know them by their fruits*.  

## Relationship of Spirit, Ethos, and Principles 

Principles and the central animating spirit or ethos of a society or community are closely related, as the principles that guide a society reflect its core values and beliefs, and its core values and beliefs reflect its unifying guiding Spirit. 

The central animating spirit or ethos of a society can be thought of as the underlying set of values and beliefs that shape its culture and way of life. 

Articulated principles help to give concrete form to the central animating spirit or ethos of a society, providing a set of guidelines for behavior and decision-making that are based on the values and beliefs that are most important to that society. In this way, principles can help to create a sense of shared purpose and unity within a community or society, and to ensure that people are acting in accordance with the values that are most important to them.

## The One Meta Principle 

For any personality or society to not be fragmented, anxious, and divided against itself, it must have One Supreme Unifying Principle that integrates, coheres, and orders within itself all other principles. This gives rise to the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Principles]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Principle]]. 

In the Lionsberg System, that [[Ultimate Principle]] is referred to as [[The One]].  

[[ONE]], or [[God]], or the [[Creator]], is the [[Ultimate Reality]] that integrates, coheres, and orders within itself the total set of [[All]] things that rise from, are sustained by, and return to It. 

[[ONE]], and [[All]]. [[All]] in [[ONE]]. 

This is not a dogmatic or religious claim, but a philosophical, psychological, and conceptual necessity. 

## The Principle of Absolute and Unconditional Love 

Across a vast array of religious and wisdom traditions, the highest guiding principle, or the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of God, has been articulated as something like [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

Therefore the universal guiding Principle can be articulated as something like: 

_Love [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]]._  

[[Love]] is the basis of [[Right Relationship]].
