# 0.5 The Guide

As your Spirit gravitates  
Your heart quickens  
Your emotions swell  
And your mind floods with questions  

A radiant figure emerges  
From **Beyond The Threshold**  
And extends a glowing hand  

_"Welcome Dear One_  
_You have traveled long and far_  
_To arrive at these Ancient Gates_  

_The Journey can be overwhelming_
_But do not worry or fear_  
_You are not alone_  

_If you **Follow Me**_  
_I can show you a **Way**_  
_Through **The Gates** the lie ahead_  

_You will soon discover_  
_That it is the **Pathway**_  
_That leads to your Destiny_ 
_And Inheritance"_
