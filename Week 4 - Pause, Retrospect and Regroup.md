# Week 4 - Pause, Retrospect and Regroup

June 26, 2023

Greetings Pioneers, 

Now that we are 21 days past The Boundary, it is time to pause, retrospect, and regroup. 

## How We Got Here

In our first few weeks of training and orientation, we covered a lot of ground: 

- **Week 1: Awakening and Calling**  
- **Week 2: Departure from the Old World**  
- **Week 3: The Vision of the New World** 

## Where We Are

This week, we were scheduled to start **Week 4: Life in the Wilderness**, exploring themes of: 

- **Sovereignty, Autonomy, and Self-Governance**  
- **Orienting and Moving in Groups**  
- **Making and Keeping the Network of Commitments**  
- **Aligning Progress via Goals and Objectives that Advance the Critical Path**  

Week 4 is the pivotal week meant to move us from the exploration of **The Gap** between **The Old** and **The New**, to ***decentralized*** and ***aligned*** action to accomplish Goals and Objectives that advance us towards **The Goal**. 

However forward progress beyond Day 21 requires that we pass the Test of successfully inviting in **The Second Wave** in order to grow **The Movement**, which we have not successfully completed. 

## Pause, Regroup, and Retrospect 

Over the last week, we received: 

- ~3 nominations from the group for The Second Wave  
- ~4 additional indications of interest from people who want to join The Second Wave  
- ~4 indications of interest from people who want to explore forging a high performing 'Founder's Team' to work with me to target, resource and accomplish goals on the [[Critical Path]]   
- ~ 3 indications of interest from people who want to learn / explore Lionsberg further  
- We could easily invite in a couple more to hit the minimum 13 for **The Second Wave**.  

Additionally, during The Exit Pool week ~3 dropped because of 'too busy', and 1 dropped citing religion. This was right in line with the expectation of ~20% attrition. There are likely more 'on the ropes'. 

Beyond that, I received feedback from: 

- A few who were deeply challenged and moved by the materials    
- A few who were overwhelmed or confused by the materials   
- A few who have questions and are seeking clarification  

I imagine that in the middle there are many who are in neutral, each having read some portion and skipped some portion of the materials, and wondering what the others are thinking. 

It is a perfect time to pause, regroup, and retrospect. 

## Week of June 26th - A Week of Pause, Introspection and Retrospection

We are still slightly ahead of schedule, so this week, let's take a break to pause, allow anyone who needs to to catch up on the readings and exercises, and individually and collectively introspect and retrospect. 

My sense / hypothesis is (something like): 

1. The orientation and training program is too heavy for most  
2. The self-guided learning journey needs to be better supported  
3. The boundaries and objectives need to be clarified    
4. Jordan is a bottleneck, more decentralization and co-creation is required      
5. Additional clarity and support is needed for the Pioneer Cohort to advance, and The Second Wave to arise  

We are committed to the flourishing of each and every participant, and we want to make sure that everything we are doing is of Value and Service. 

## Tentative Aim 

Tentatively, let's plan on retrospective discussion this week in small groups, ***sending feedback to Jordan***, seeing what conditions we can rapidly co-create or transform, and plan on the Pioneer Cohort Advancing into Day 22 and Second Wave Arising into Day 1 **Sunday July 2nd**. 

***Please reach out with your feedback, wisdom, discernment, and guidance so our collective intelligence is reflected in What Happens Next.*** 

With Love and Humility, In Community,
