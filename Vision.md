## On The Importance of Vision

Two cannot walk together unless they are aligned. A vessel pulled in different directions will be torn asunder. Without a Vision, the people perish. 

- Alignment proceeds from shared [[Vision]]. 
- In order to forge shared Vision, We must [[Dialogue]] with one another. We must cross the boundaries that have separated us and talk, so that we can discover a shared Vision. 
- Once we discover a shared Vision we can discover the pathways and milestones that mark the Way, and then begin moving together voluntarily towards it. 
- As we Progress, we can learn and share the [[Stories]].  
- Those stories then become Prophesies of even greater things that are possible.   
- Top down compulsion is by definition failed governance. [[Governance]] based on power, coercion, and threat is by definition failure.  
- Vision and [[Wisdom]] are the antidotes.
