## On The Importance of Vision

Two cannot walk together unless they are aligned. A vessel pulled in different directions will be torn asunder. Without a Vision, the people perish. 

- Alignment proceeds from shared [[Vision]]. 
- In order to forge shared Vision, We must [[Dialogue]] with one another. We must cross the boundaries that have separated us and talk, so that we can discover a shared Vision. 
- Once we discover a shared Vision of [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]], we can compare it to [[Where We Are]].
- From there, we can discover the pathways and [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]], and then begin to voluntarily [[Progress]] together towards it. 
- As we [[Progress]], we can learn and share the [[Stories]].  
- Those stories then become [[Prophesies]] of even greater things that are possible as we continue to advance.   
- Top down compulsion is by definition failed governance. [[Governance]] based on power, coercion, and threat is by definition failure.  
- Vision, [[Wisdom]], and [[Voluntary Association]] around our [[Goals]] and [[Values]] are the antidotes.
