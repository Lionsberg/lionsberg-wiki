# The Future

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]] and [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]], **The Future** refers to the shared Vision of the loving, just, regenerative, and flourishing world that is the ultimate goal of the [[Citizen Led Response]] to the [[Meta Crisis]]. This vision includes:

-   A thriving and regenerative environment, with healthy ecosystems and flourishing biodiversity
-   A just and loving society, with access to basic needs and opportunities for All Citizens without exception 
-   A flourishing economy, with shared prosperity and meaningful work for All 
-   A renewed sense of community and shared purpose, based on uniting Vision, Principles, and Values 
-   Advancements in science and technology that are used for the multi-generational benefit of All, rather the short term profit of a privileged few
-   A deep and abiding sense of spirituality, rooted in a recognition of the interconnectedness of all life and the shared responsibility of all  life to rightly relate to one another and our common Source 

This Positive Vision of the future is not only aspirational, but it is also necessary for the survival and well-being of humanity and the planet. The Lionsberg System and The Great Game of Lionsberg aim to co-create this future by empowering citizens around the world to take individual and collective action to address the challenges of the Meta Crisis and co-create a better world for [[All]].
