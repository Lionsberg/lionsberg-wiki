## **2  |  Guidance for the Circles**

| **Principle**          | **Specification**                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circle Size**        | 3 – 12 people (ideal 5-7)                                                                                                 |
| **Composition**        | balanced by polarity, temperament, and gift; may mix households, vocations, ages                                          |
| **Covenant**           | one shared vow                                                                                                            |
| **Rhythm**             | meet weekly, monthly (for synthesis), seasonally (for Quest celebration and Omnispection)                                 |
| **Facilitation**       | rotating Steward of the Week; decisions by consensus or consent                                                           |
| **Accountability**     | keep a living journal; one page per week; mutually witness individual and collective progress, impact, and transformation |
| **Autonomy**           | self-governing; may federate with other Circles into Guilds or Local Commons                                              |
| **Safety & Integrity** | peer support, transparency, immediate care protocols for emotional / energetic overwhelm                                  |

This ensures every participant travels in companionship, every Circle becomes a cell of the New Civilization, and the network scales fractally.
