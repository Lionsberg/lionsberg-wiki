# Truth

"Truth" refers to the quality or state of being in accordance with fact, [[Reality]], or the [[Ultimate Reality]]. It is often considered to be the highest, [[Deepest]], and most fundamental standard of excellence and a guiding principle for [[Wisdom]], [[Knowledge]], and [[Morality]].

In the context of the Lionsberg System, Truth is understood to be a characteristic of Ultimate Reality, reflecting the Ultimate Standard of wisdom, [[Goodness]], and beauty that serves as the inspiration and guide for the movement towards its Vision, Aim, and Goal. The pursuit of Truth is central to the Lionsberg System, and [[All]] are encouraged to seek Truth in all aspects of their lives, and to align their thoughts, words, and actions with this highest standard of excellence.

The Lionsberg System recognizes that Absolute Truth is something that remains eternally beyond our grasp, and encourages its members to explore, search, and appreciate the richness and diversity of perspectives as we [[Navigate Towards Truth]] together.
