# Truth

"Truth" refers to the quality or state of being in accordance with fact or [[Reality]] as it actually is. It is often considered to be the highest, [[Deepest]], and most fundamental standard of excellence and a guiding principle for [[Wisdom]], [[Knowledge]], and [[Morality]].

In the context of the Lionsberg System, Truth is understood to be a characteristic of Ultimate Reality, reflecting the Ultimate Standard of wisdom, [[Goodness]], and beauty that serves as the inspiration and guide for the movement towards its Vision, Aim, and Goal. The pursuit of Truth is central to the Lionsberg System, and [[All]] are encouraged to seek Truth in all aspects of their lives, and to align their thoughts, words, and actions with this highest standard of excellence.

A culture that loves, seeks and speaks Truth leads to honesty, humility, openness, and continuous learning and growth. 

The Lionsberg System recognizes that Absolute Truth is something that remains eternally beyond our grasp, and encourages its members to explore, search, and appreciate the richness and diversity of perspectives as we [[Navigate Towards Truth]] together, no matter where it leads. 

Because Absolute Truth is beyond our grasp, the Lionsberg convention is to express things in the form of our [[Current Best Understanding]] or [[Hypothesis]], and to continuously improve the Quality of our Understanding and expression of That Which is is True, Wise, Right, and Good. 

Recognizing that learning and understanding are a process, we commit to being patient with one another as we learn and grow in Community.
