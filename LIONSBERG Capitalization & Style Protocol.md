# **LIONSBERG Capitalization & Style Protocol**

### — _For the Coherence of the Sacred Texts and the Wiki_ —

The LIONSBERG Wiki is a **living library and training ground**. Its words are meant to transmit both clarity and sacred resonance. The way we write matters.

This protocol ensures coherence, legibility, and symbolic integrity across thousands of pages.

---

## 1. **Divine and Transcendent Terms**

- **ONE** — always in full capitals, to indicate Source / Unity / the Infinite.
    
- **Logos** — capitalized, as the Eternal Word / Pattern / Ordering Principle.
    
- **Creator’s Intent** — both words capitalized, when referring to the highest design of existence.
    
- **Sacred, Divine, Holy** — capitalized when used in formal or archetypal sense; lowercase when used in general descriptive sense.
    
- **ReMembrance** — camel-capitalization, to show the act of “re-membering” (restoring members to wholeness).

## 2. **Cosmic and Temporal Language**

- **MetaCrisis** — always capitalized; it names the multidimensional convergence of crises.
    
- **Kairos** vs. **Chronos** — capitalized to mark the distinction of sacred vs. linear time.
    
- **Sacred Ascent, Sacred Journey, Sacred Way** — all capitalized in formal usage.
    
- **Threshold, Exodus, Wilderness, Ascent** — capitalized when used in mythic/archetypal sense, lowercase in descriptive.
    

---

## 3. **Collective Pronouns**

- **We, Us, Our** — capitalized when referring to humanity / the collective protagonist in the Sacred Story. Lowercase when used in ordinary grammatical context.
    
- **You** — capitalized sparingly; often avoided in favor of “We” language unless intimacy/personalization is necessary.
    
- **They / Them** — lowercase, unless referring to archetypal forces (e.g., “The Powers That Were”).

## 4. **Structures and Institutions**

- **LIONSBERG** — always full capitals when naming the System, Wiki, Commons, or Project.
    
- **The First Three Percent** — capitalized when naming the vanguard role.
    
- **The New Civilization** — capitalized when naming the emerging reality.
    
- **The Old World / The Old System** — capitalized when referring to the failing order.
    
- **The Grand Strategy, The Way, The Circle, The Quest** — capitalized when referring to formal patterns within the system.

## 5. **Pages, Links, and Artifacts**

- Wiki page names in **[[Double Brackets]]** are written in Title Case.
    
- Symbols (🌱, 🦁, etc.) **not included in titles** but may be placed **within pages** for resonance, emphasis, or wayfinding.
    
- Italics for emphasis and foreign terms (_kairos_, _logos_, _siddhi_) when first introduced.
    

---

## 6. **Tone and Voice**

- **Voice of the Text**: Transcendent “We/Us” voice preferred for universality.
    
- **Avoid excess jargon**; define terms in the [[LIONSBERG Lexicon]].
    
- **Simple > Complex** when in doubt. Complexity belongs in deeper layers, not first contact.
    
- **Affirmative > Negative**: focus on what is emerging, not just what is collapsing.
    

---

## 7. **Special Formatting**

- **Bold** for key calls to action (e.g., **Start Here**, **Form Your Circle**).
    
- **Italics** for poetic resonance, sacred quotations, or subtle emphasis.
    
- **Blockquotes** (`>`) for timeless sayings, myths, or sacred phrases.
    
- **Lists and Steps** to make complex systems feel simple and actionable.
    

---

## 8. **Consistency of Archetypes**

When naming archetypes or Streams, always use Title Case:

- Warrior, Creator, Healer, Philosopher, Lover, Steward, Mystic.  
    When pluralized, also capitalized (e.g., “The Warriors and Healers among us”).

## Closing Note

This protocol is not rigid law but **living guidance**.  
When in doubt, ask: _Does this word transmit the Logos more clearly? Does it resonate as True, Sacred, and Coherent?_
