# Guilds 

The large scale decentralized and coordinated activity require that the [[Federation]] discern how it would organize itself to train, equip, and empower the vast array of [[Functions]] that would be required for it to succeed as a [[Whole]] in its [[Mission]]. 

Eventually, as sovereigns (groups, organizations, integrated delivery teams) mature, they will combine autonomy and tradecraft with education. As Groups develop internal skills training, it will make sense for Groups of similar Function to generalize out and reconcile their processes and [[Current Best Understanding]] around common material. 

The function of Guilds is share wisdom and best understanding across a range of Groups engaged in similar areas of Practice. 

## Capacity Building 
One core function of the [[Guilds]] is to build capacity in key functional areas across the distributed network of [[Sovereigns]] in the [[Federation]]. 

## Functional Accountability
A second core function of the [[Guilds]] is to establish Core Groups who are be accountable for the proper functioning of their unique part of the [[Whole]].  

## Organs in a Body
A metaphor was established to reflect that the [[Whole]] needed to operate as if it were a single body. In this metaphor, each guild would represent the [[Functions|Function]] of a particular organ or organ system. 

## Guild Lifecycle
- Describe a need
- When the need reaches a threshold, create a sovereign
	- establish a leader and a spokesperson
	- purpose and responsibility statement
	- establish the initial team
	- articulate and design
		governance
		tradecraft
		training
- gradually operationalize the sovereign
- identify and acquire stakeholders
- become a guild
	- attract, onboard and train apprentices

## Threshold of Need
We anticipate continually having more needs than we can pursue during each 90 day [[Seasonal Quest]]. This requires a system to [[Prioritize The Issues]] so they can be addressed in the [[Wise Right]] order.
