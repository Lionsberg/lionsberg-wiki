# The LIONSBERG Circle Guide

## What a Circle Is
  
A Circle is the smallest complete unit of the New Civilization.
  
It is not a club.
Not a class.
Not an organization.
  
A Circle is a living field of trust,
Formed by people who choose to show up
With sincerity, responsibility, and care  
To help one another grow, transform,  
And co-create Heaven On Earth  
  
Circles are how Heaven becomes practical.
  
They are where abstraction becomes relationship,
and where ideals become action.
  
## Why Circles Matter
  
Civilizations do not change because of ideas alone.
They change because small groups of people
Begin being, acting, and living differently—together.
  
History shows this pattern again and again.
  
LIONSBERG circles exist to:

- Awaken shared clarity
    
- Strengthen right relationship
    
- Take tangible transformative action in the world
    
- and Pass The Flame onward
    
  
No Circle is meant to last forever.
Every Circle is meant to transform our lives and our worlds.
  
## Forming a Circle
  
A Circle may begin with as few as three people.
Five to seven is often ideal.
Twelve is a natural upper bound,  
After which it is natural for the emerging organism to split into two.
  
Begin by gathering—physically or digitally—and reading aloud:

- The Prologue
    
- The Story
    
- The Quickstart Guide
    
- And this Circle Guide
    
  
Then pause.
  
Let silence do some of the work.
  
### Naming the Circle
  
Choose a name that:

- feels alive
    
- reflects your locality, intention, or shared image
    
- can grow with you
    
  
The name matters less than the care with which it is chosen.  
It is provisional and can be changed at any time.  
  
### Establishing Agreements
  
Agreements are not rules.
They are shared commitments that protect the field.
  
Every Circle is self-governing, autonomous,  
and should explicitly affirm its own agreements.  

At minimum, consider the following:

- Presence — We show up as fully as we can.
    
- Truthfulness — We speak honestly and humbly, without performance.
    
- Respect — We listen deeply and honor diverse perspectives.
    
- Confidentiality — What is shared in the Circle is protected.
    
- Consent — No one is coerced into belief, action, or interaction.
    
- Responsibility — Each person owns their words and choices.
    
  
Agreements may evolve.
Revisit them seasonally. 
Improve them continually.  
  
## How Circles Meet
  
There is no single correct format.
However, healthy Circles tend to include:

1. Arrival
    
    - Showing up "on time" as each circle's culture defines it  
        
    - a moment of grounding  
        
    - a few deep breaths to land  
        
    - a couple minutes of silence to establish presence and coherence  
        
    
2. Check-In
    
    - each person briefly shares where they are and how they are coming in (1-2 minutes each) 
        
    - no fixing, no commentary, just deep listening and shared presence   
        
    
3. Shared Learning, Reading, or Reflection  
    
    - a passage from **The Story**  
        
    - a Play from **The Playbook**  
        
    - or a **Profound Question** offered to the Circle  
        
    
4. Dialogue / Dialogos / Mind Weaving  
    
    - humbly admit "We Do Not Know" so that Wisdom and Truth can be revealed  
        
    - honor and invite the presence of the Spirit / Divine Guest in the room  
        
    - speak authentically from center, source, and lived experience only when moved to do so  
        
    - listen deeply for understanding and resonant threads, not disagreement    
        
    - "Yes And" — affirm and build upon one another's statements without contradicting or tearing down the perspectives offered  
        
    - own your triggers — negative emotion is often a gift revealing something internal longing to be healed  
        
    
5. Orientation Toward Action
    
    - What is the status of our **Seasonal Quest**? 
        
    - What is needed?
        
    - What is possible?
        
    - What is ours to do?
        
    - What are the **Wise Right Next Steps?** 
        
    
6. Tracking Commitments  
    
    - Invite each member to make at least one specific, measurable, time bound commitment that advances the [[Critical Path]] of the Seasonal Quest 
        
    - Review the [[Commitment Tracker]], mark yes or no to indicate whether previous commitments were kept, and update the Circle's [[Percent Commitments Kept]]  
        
    
7. Closing
    
    - gratitude
        
    - retrospection — each participant rate the meeting on a scale of 1 to 10, and either celebrate "something positive that we would like to continue in the future" or suggest "something we could do even better in the future"
        
    - silence 
        
    - closing gesture, ritual, or phrase
        
    
  
Consistency matters more than length.
Ninety minutes is often ideal.
  
## Cadence and Rhythm
  
Circles thrive on rhythm.
  
Experience strongly suggests:

- a weekly gathering
    
- a monthly reflection
    
- and a seasonal Quest
    
  
These rhythms anchor relationship, consistency, and trust
and prevent the Circle from dissolving into abstraction or distraction.  
  
## Seasonal Quests
  
A Seasonal Quest is a shared, tangible act of goodwill  
That produces **throughput** of **The Goal** of Heaven On Earth.
  
It should:

- serve real people or places
    
- be achievable within ninety days
    
- stretch the Circle slightly—but not break it (zone of optimum development)
    
- eventually require collaboration with other circles  
    
  
Examples:

- supporting a neighbor or family in need
    
- restoring a neglected space
    
- hosting a community conversation
    
- creating something useful or beautiful
    
- hosting a book club and leveraging learnings into an upcoming seasonal quest
    
  
The Quest is where the Game becomes real.
  

## Stories of Transformation 

Each solstice or equinox, share your Circle's [[Stories of Transformation]]  

Your Circle's story should communicate what happened last season  
And what positive impact, value, or transformation was created as a result   
As well as what your circle plans to do in your next [[Seasonal Quest]]  

Stories of Transformation are designed to fuel [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]]  

## Roles (Lightly Held)
  
Circles do not require hierarchy.
They do benefit from shared stewardship  
And clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
  
Roles may rotate seasonally  
And may include archetypes such as:

- Convener — holds, opens, and closes the meeting container  
    
- Timekeeper — protects pacing  
    
- Scribe — captures insights or decisions  
    
- Connector — links with other circles and supports **Passing the Flame** outward  
    
- Relationship Development — develops new relationships, resources, and opportunities on behalf of the circle   
    
  
Roles exist to serve the Circle functionally—not to confer status.
  
## When Tension Arises
  
Tension is not failure.
Avoidance is.

Both convergence and divergence  
Are important parts of any circle's journey.  
  

When conflict appears:

- slow down
    
- return to shared purpose and agreements
    
- speak from personal experience
    
- listen without rehearsing replies
    
- identify unmet needs (present) or fears (future) 
    
- agree on the smallest adjustment that satisfies and reconciles all in play 
    
  
If needed, pause the Quest before breaking trust.  
As a rule of thumb, if tension and divergence cannot be resolved  
By the parties impacted within a few days,  
Seek the council of a wise elder outside the circle.  
  
Circles grow by learning to stay present
through discomfort—without harm.
  
## Passing the Flame
  
Circles are not meant to hoard coherence  
And Heaven cannot be co-created in isolation or stagnation.  
  
Passing the Flame means:

- sharing stories of transformation  
    
- inviting others without pressure  
    
- supporting the birth of new Circles  
    
- monitoring the progress of **The Game** against the [[Milestones]] 
    
  
When a Circle grows beyond intimacy,
Follow the pattern of Nature,  
Seed a new one,  
Remain connected,  
And celebrate the growth of The Game  
  
This is how the New Civilization scales—
not by control, but by cellular replication with care.
  
## When a Circle Completes Its Arc
  
Every Circle has a lifecycle.  
All Circles dissolve naturally at some point in their Story.  
This is not failure.
This is how nature and reality works.  
  
A Circle has completed its arc when:

- its purpose has been fulfilled
    
- or its members are called elsewhere
    
- or new forms are ready to emerge
    
  
Close with gratitude.
Name what was learned.
Share the Stories.  
Ensure no one is involuntarily left behind.  
Embody new and improved forms.  
Pass the Flame forward.  
  
Nothing true is lost.

### A Closing Reminder
  
A Circle does not need to be perfect.
It needs to be committed and sincere.
  
If even two or three people
choose truth, care, and collaborative action together,
the New Civilization has already begun.
