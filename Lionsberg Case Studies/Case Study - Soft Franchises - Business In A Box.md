# Case Study - Soft Franchises - Business In A Box

In a few weeks, we will commence training the first Lionsberg Intrapreneurs.

## **A New Paradigm of Entrepreneurship**

Whereas the Old World celebrated individual entrepreneurs who “went out” and built “their own” businesses that they “owned,” the New System celebrates [[Team Based Intrapreneurs]] who co-steward and co-create within a self-governing federated system.  

From systems theory and the immutable principles governing nature and society, we understand that true potential and power lie in the **Synergy** between elements of the system, not in the elements themselves.

## **Training, Equipping, and Empowering the First Three Percent**

As we work to train and equip [[The First Three Percent]] of the population—roughly 250 million leaders—we aim to foster a collaborative ecosystem. Instead of creating 50 million businesses and non-profits competing with one another, we envision 50 million entities collaborating to co-create a new world and paradigm.

## **The 1,000 Heroes Project**  

We are embarking on a pioneering [[1,000 Heroes]] project to identify, train, and equip the first 1,000 [[Lionsberg Intrapreneurs]]. Each intrapreneur will receive support to establish a cooperatively run business or non-profit as part of the emergent Lionsberg Confederation.

Drawing inspiration from successful socioeconomic experiments like Mondragon and the United States, each intrapreneur will have an equal membership, voice and opportunity within the Lionsberg System and the abundance we co-create.  

## **Ownership and Stewardship**

The Lionsberg System operates on the spiritual principle of multi-generational **Stewardship** rather than the narrower lens of self-interested ownership.

Each **Intrapreneurial Team** of 5 to 7 individuals will have the autonomy to set up their local legal and governance structures in a manner that enables collective governance and stewardship. Additionally, each individual will have a voice in the system, adhering to the principle of [[One Citizen One Voice]]. 

The [[Provisional Structure]] for [[The Federation]] has been established to ensure multi-generational stewardship and self-sustainability over the coming millennia.

## **Freely Received, Freely Given**

The system, resources, capabilities, and backbone technology will be freely provided to participants. The expectation is that the first 1/10th of profits or resource flows will be voluntarily donated back to the system. This will create more **Meaningful Work** and **Meaningful Relationships**, while continuously improving the quality of systems, infrastructure, and support available to All.

## **Soft Franchises: Business In A Box**

The **1,000 Heroes** and their successors will co-create and continuously improve an array of [[Soft Franchises]] stewarded in **The Commons**. These franchises can then be deployed globally, with **Co-Operators** of any given franchise type feeding learnings and improvements back to The Commons. This ensures that the 100th instantiation of a franchise benefits from the experiences of the first 99.

Our goal is to package opportunities where [[Intrapreneurial Teams]] are able to earn an amount each month equal to or greater than the startup capital involved.

## **Organizing Around The Grand Challenges**

**Soft Franchises** will initially be organized around **Grand Challenges** and **Global Goals**, transforming every issue we face into an opportunity for local socioeconomic empowerment.

As challenges and goals are clarified and the **1,000 Heroes** embark on their journey, we will search globally for the best ideas and solutions. These will be systematized, packaged, and then poly-centrically replicated, localized, and adapted in communities worldwide.

## **Measurable Impact**

The microbusinesses, systems, and processes will be structured to measure the impact of each local business or team, as well as the **Team of Teams** as a whole, against key issues and opportunities we collectively face.  

## **Confederation**

Each **Intrapreneurial Team** and **Soft Franchise** will be federated, transparently sharing learnings and the first 1/10th of resource flows to fuel the growth and abundance of The System as a Whole. The result will be a planetary array of [[Mondragon]]-like federations, each serving local communities and bioregions.   

The design of **The System** reflects the **Wisdom of Nature**, where everything is interdependent and interconnected.

## **Capital**

Capital in **The System** is viewed as a subordinate, non-equity tool earning a maximum of 7% interest. Capital can enter **The System** in two ways:

1. **Donations** to the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) public charity.

2. **Investments** into the Lionsberg Community Development Fund.

Startup capital will be lent by the **Lionsberg Community Development Fund** to the **Intrapreneurial Teams**, who will repay it with moderate interest. This will grow the fund, offset risks, and make the funds available rapidly to empower the next cohort of heroes. This pattern will operate similarly to microfinance, eventually helping the **Regenerative Banking Network** emerge.

## **Accounting and Cash Flow**

**Intrapreneurial Teams** will be trained in proper accounting and cash flow management using two parallel systems:

1. Fiat currency.

2. Lionsberg Units of Value (Time-Energy Accounting System).

## **Advisory Teams**

The project will have two parallel advisory teams:

2. **Capital Council** (Composed of significant lenders and donors).

The Core Team will issue a Progress Report and Request for Guidance to each of the councils and the **Intrapreneurial Teams** no less than monthly, in accordance with the Lionsberg Communications System.
