# Spring 2024 Experiment

In Spring 2024 (March - June), [[Jordan]] launched his final experiment.  

Carefully monitoring the cycles of growth, an organism emerged through ***8 [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] cycles in about 80 to 90 days, for a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of 10 to 11 days***. 

By June, there was an additional invitation list of ~150 on this list + hundreds of others on adjacent lists and projects of various co-creators. 

[[Jordan]] had set a trigger / restriction, whereby he could not personally invite in more than the first ~100, after which the cycles would need to become self sustaining. 

In the end, despite an 80%+ [[Lionsberg Acceptance Rate]] of [[The Invitation]], the Spring 2024 [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] lacked the leadership, clarity and commitment required to become, out of many, [[ONE Bodyx]]. 

During the experiment, [[Jordan]] began to be reminded of the vast diversity of highly advanced [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] influencing the affairs of humanity, and being contacted by representatives thereof. 

His Journey through the summer UnVeiled [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]], as outlined in his final report: [[Existential Threat - Reporting Back From Battle]].

## Cycle Time Summary

To accomplish this by 2026, a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of no more than 3.66 Weeks / Cycle is required for the first 40 Cycles. 
(March 2024 to December 2026 = 34 Months x 4.3 Weeks / Month = 146 Weeks Divided by 40 Cycles = 3.66 Weeks / Cycle).

After this has been accomplished, the decentralized [[Force For Good]] has (365 weeks - 146 weeks = 219 weeks remaining) to accomplish the remaining 8 Cycles of Growth. 

[[The Movement]] has a significant decision to make on whether it progresses this slowly, or chooses to capture the [[2024 Opportunity]] (see below under "Remaining")

## Spring 2024 Experiment 

- [[Lionsberg History and Inception]]  
- Cycle 1: 2 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 2: 3 Co-Creators  - 1 Day  
- Cycle 3: 5 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 4: 8 Co-Creators (0.0000001%) - 2 Days  
- Cycle 5: 13 Co-Creators - 1 Day  
- Cycle 6: 21 Co-Creators - 5 Days  
- Integration (No Invitations): 3 Weeks 
- Cycle 7: 34 Co-Creators - 2 Weeks (7 Cycles in ~7 Weeks) 
- Cycle 8: 55 Co-Creators - 4 Weeks (8 Cycles in ~11 Weeks) 

**2024 Opportunity**
- If we pulse the movement quickly, we can have enough enlightened co-creators standing behind the [[New Vision and Plan]] by November 2024 to sweep the executive branch in the United States Election.  
	- We would have an independent US President and several governors among The Movement  
	- We could dramatically mitigate the existential threat of an AI + Thermonuclear WWIII, and leverage the logistical capacity of the United States and allies for aid and relief efforts instead (swords to ploughshares / weaponry to livingry)     
	- By 2026 we will have 250 Million connected and empowered co-creators standing behind the [[New Vision and Plan]], enabling the next round of realignment in the United States and around the world.       
	- By 2027 (1/2 way through [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]) we would have access to the constitutional amendment mechanisms to reset the American Experiment, disband the corrupt bureaucracies, decentralize power, and realign it in service of [[The Goal]]     
	- This would enable us to structurally solve many issues at the root of corruption and mis-incentives around the world, while mitigating the risk of a [[Collapse]] into world war, [[Chaos]], or [[Tyranny]]    
- This merely requires that each person begin identifying and onboarding one other person a week to The Movement. It is entirely possible. Do we care enough to cause this to happen?

In ~two weeks on tour (part with family), the Cycle 7 Co-Creators were identified, and 50+ names surfaced to extend the Cycle 8 invitations to - see [[Above The Chaos, April 2024 Above The Chaos Tour Findings|April 2024 Above The Chaos Tour Findings]]).

## Cycle 8: Expansion Out To 55 Co-Creators   

- Completing [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] **Cycle 8** requires adding 21 additional co-creators. 
- Prepare for acceptance rate to drop towards 30% to 50%. 
- Against the ~40 to 60 invitations required, we now have a running list of ~130 well qualified candidates and a significantly compelling center of gravity.   
- Additionally, for the first time we have the [[The Invitation Pool]] composed *primarily* of names surfaced through the collective wisdom and discernment of the Lionsberg Co-Creators, and not merely Jordan.
