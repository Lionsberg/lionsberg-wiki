# Lionsberg Way

The Lionsberg Way is our attempt to embody, systematize, and continuously improve the universal and eternal [[Way]] that cannot be named. 

It represents "the way we do things around here". 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed as a [[Pattern Language]] that is meant to be localized and adapted to fit the unique needs and circumstances of each individual, group, and locality, while affording interoperability across instantiations. 

The Lionsberg Way is continuously improved via the [[Lionsberg System]].
