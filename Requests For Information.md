# Requests For Information

The Lionsberg System allows [[Members]] to submit Requests For Information via the Lionsberg Instance of the Procore platform. 

Requests for information ensure that any member who is unclear about any aspect of the Creator's Intent or the Lionsberg System, Approach, Strategy or Plan can ask questions and receive answers in a transparent, accountable and time-measurable way that is accessible to all other Members.
