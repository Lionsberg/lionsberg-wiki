# 11.9 Rising towards Higher Order Functional Unity


The Lionsberg Strategy places a strong emphasis on the gradual rise towards highest order functional unity. This refers to the process of progressively aligning and integrating all physical and metaphysical resources and capabilities in service of creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.

The gradual rise towards highest order functional unity is a critical component of the strategy because it acknowledges that the Meta Crisis is a result of a lack of functional unity in human systems. Current systems are fragmented, disconnected, and in opposition to the living systems that contain and sustain them. Therefore, in order to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis, it is necessary to create functional unity and alignment between human systems and the living systems that contain and sustain them.

The process of achieving highest order functional unity is not a one-time event, but a continuous journey that requires ongoing commitment and effort. It is a gradual process that begins with small, local efforts and gradually builds momentum to larger, more systemic changes.

The gradual rise towards highest order functional unity also includes the process of increasing consciousness and collaboration among individuals, communities, organizations, and governments. This process begins with individuals taking personal responsibility for their actions and making conscious choices that align with the principles and values of the Lionsberg System and Approach. As individuals align their actions with the New Vision and Plan, communities and organizations will also begin to align their actions, leading to a cascading effect of alignment and integration in service of our overarching and uniting shared goals and values. 

Achieving highest order functional unity also requires the collaboration and partnership of all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, organizations, and governments. This collaboration and partnership is built on trust, transparency, and accountability. It also requires a willingness to listen, learn, and adapt as new information, insights, and technologies become available.

This rise towards highest order functional unity in service of [[One]] and [[All]] is expected to emerge along a developmental gradient that begins with basic awareness, and progress upwards through a ladder of communication, intention, coordination, collaboration, integration, and ultimately highest order functional unity as entirely regenerated and reintegrated human and living systems. 

In summary, the gradual rise towards highest order functional unity is a critical component of the Lionsberg Strategy. It acknowledges that addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis requires creating functional unity and alignment between human systems and the living systems that contain and sustain them. It also emphasizes the importance of consciousness, collaboration, and ongoing commitment to the process of achieving highest order functional unity. Lastly, it recognizes that this process of progressive realization cannot occur except through our attempts to embody it at each fractal level of the human system across all physical and metaphysical domains of existence.

It is important to remember that this is gradual process is not abstract or "out there", but rather occurs from the bottom up through the ongoing commitment and effort of each individual and community to progressively embody the New Pattern Language.  This involves a continuous journey of alignment, integration, and collaboration among all stakeholders. The gradual rise towards highest order functional unity is a necessary step in creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth, it is essential to the success of the Lionsberg Strategy. It is also the only way the New Vision and Plan can inbreak and become our reality. 

It is important to note that this process of gradual rise towards highest order functional unity may be a long and complex journey, and it will require the ongoing development of new technologies, systems, and governance structures to support it. Additionally, it will also require significant cultural and societal shifts in values, beliefs, and behaviors to align with the principles and values of the Lionsberg System and Approach.

It is also important to recognize that this process of gradual rise towards highest order functional unity will be different for each community and society, and will be shaped by the unique circumstances and context of each community. Therefore, the implementation of the strategy will require flexibility, adaptability, and a willingness to experiment and learn from different approaches and strategies, and the unique local experiences unfolding around the world. 

It is also important to note that this process will require effective leadership, governance, and management at all levels, to provide the necessary support, guidance, and resources to enable individuals and communities to participate fully in this process. The Lionsberg Strategy will be continuously reviewed, updated and refined as new information, insights, and technologies become available, to ensure that the implementation of the strategy remains on track and aligned with the overarching goals and values articulated in the New Vision and Plan.
