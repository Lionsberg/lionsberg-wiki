# FAQ - Where Will The Resources Come From To Get To Where We Are Going?

The resources for the implementation and growth of the Lionsberg System will come from a variety of sources. One of the main sources will be through the participation and investment of individuals and communities who believe in the vision and values of the system. Additionally, partnerships with private businesses and organizations, as well as funding from government grants and programs, will also contribute to the resources needed for the implementation and growth of the Lionsberg System. The system is also designed to be financially self-sustaining over time through the creation of income-generating organizations, projects and initiatives that align with the goals and values of the system. The equity and value produced by such initiatives will be transparently stewarded for the good of All as a collective endowment to ensure the long-term sustainability of the system. It is important to note that the system is designed to be self-sustaining transparent, accountable, and free from any special or financial interests that could compromise its ability to serve One and All.

Additionally, fundraising efforts will be conducted through crowdfunding, grants, and investments from passionate individuals and organizations who believe in the mission and values of the Lionsberg System. These resources will be used to develop the prototype, conduct research and development, and build the team of teams to support the implementation of the 7-year plan. The Lionsberg System also prioritizes the use of sustainable and regenerative economic models, such as social impact investing and community-based microfinance and entrepreneurship, to ensure that the financial resources needed to sustain and grow the system are sourced ethically and responsibly. In this way, the Lionsberg System ensures that it is not only financially self-sufficient, but also contributes to the betterment of society and the planet as a whole.
