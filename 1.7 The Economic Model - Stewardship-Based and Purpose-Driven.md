# 1.7 The Economic Model - Stewardship-Based and Purpose-Driven

The economic model at the core of the Great Game of Lionsberg is designed to be both stewardship-based and purpose-driven. This innovative approach ensures that the game's activities and outcomes align with the principles and patterns of the New Operating System and contribute to the creation of a more just and regenerative world.

Key aspects of the stewardship-based and purpose-driven economic model include:

1.  **Resource Stewardship**: The game encourages players to carefully manage resources in a responsible and sustainable manner, considering the needs of current and future generations. This includes conserving natural resources, reducing waste, and minimizing ecological impact, as well as optimizing the use of financial, human, and social capitals to create [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].
    
2.  **Purpose-Driven Business Models**: In the New Operating System, businesses and organizations prioritize their reason for being and social and environmental impact as primary, and economic sustainability as crucial yet secondary. The Great Game of Lionsberg supports the development of new business models that create multi-generational value for stakeholders, address societal challenges, and meaningfully contribute to the realization of the [[New Vision and Plan]].
    
3.  **Value Creation and Distribution**: The game fosters a more loving, just and good distribution of wealth and resources, by promoting initiatives that create shared value and ensure that the benefits of economic and community growth are accessible to all. This includes supporting social enterprises, cooperatives, and other models that prioritize community well-being and advance social and environmental objectives.
    
4.  **Innovative Financing Mechanisms**: The Great Game of Lionsberg explores and promotes alternative financing mechanisms that align with the principles of stewardship and purpose-driven economics. This includes regenerative investing, community crowdfunding, and blended finance models that channel resources towards initiatives that contribute to the common good, and can be measured across generations rather than months or quarters. 
    
5.  **Collaboration and Shared Prosperity**: The economic model of the game emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnership in the pursuit of shared prosperity. Players are encouraged to work together, pooling their resources, knowledge, and expertise to co-create solutions that benefit everyone involved. This approach fosters a spirit of cooperation and mutual support, replacing competition with a culture of collective growth and abundance.
    

By embedding these principles into the economic model of the Great Game of Lionsberg, the game serves as a powerful vehicle for transforming our economic systems and creating a more just, regenerative, and purpose-driven world.
