# We Do Not Know

In the [[Lionsberg System]], **We Do Not Know** is a [[Word Tool]] that is used as a universal statement of humility and open mindedness. It expresses humility and openness to new information and perspectives, recognizing that our current views will always transform as we learn more.

_"We Do Not Know, but we will search it out."_

In the [[Myth Of Lionsberg]], which starts to unfold in [[The Book of Lionsberg]], the conceptual idea of not knowing is brought into vivid imaginative form through the idea of well fortified [[Boundary of Knowing]] that lies beyond [[The Caves]] that humanity is imprisoned in. 

In order to begin the [[Quest]] towards the [[New]], every individual must pass through a [[Threshold]] that requires laying down every certainty other than [[ONE]] Mystery, and reframing everything in terms of a [[Current Best Understanding]]. 

This facilitates the emergence of a [[Meta Science]] through which humanity works together to chase the [[Golden Thread|Golden Threads]] of [[Truth]] and [[Wisdom]] towards [[The Goal]].
