# The Body

In the context of Lionsberg, The Body is a metaphor associated with [[The Idea]] of the [[ONE]] that permeates, sustains, and orders [[All Creation]] within ItSelf. 

It speaks to the Ultimate Unity of the Creator and All Creation; the idea of All Creation as the Living Embodiment of the transcendent [[Ultimate Reality]].  

It calls forth the [[New Covenant]] of Universal and Eternal Right Relationship between the Creator and [[All Creation]]. 

Lionsberg is attempting to [[Incarnate]] this idea, and invite [[The Body]] into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] through [[Love]]. 

For another similar metaphor, see [[The Sacred Tree]] and [[The Golden Seed]].
