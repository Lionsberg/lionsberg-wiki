# 2.9 Every Quest Is A Project

As [[We Have Heard]] it said, 

>_[[Absolute Statements Are Always Wrong]]_  

Nevertheless, [[Memes]] are powerful. 

As you discover [[What To Do]] and [[Choose Your Next Quest]], remember that in The Great Game of LIONSBERG, [[Every Quest is a Project]] / [[Everything Is A Project]]. 

The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Projects]] that we (and [[All Creation]]) are engaged in is united by the conceptual [[Meta Project]] that [[LIONSBERG]] exists to enable. 

Treating everything — especially our main [[Seasonal Quests]] — as projects is a core [[Discipline]] and [[Practice]] that enables us, over the course of many seasons, years, and generations, to progressively develop our capacity to accomplish ever greater things in community, and to ensure that those [[Ever Greater Things]] can be systematically resourced and integrated across the emergent ecosystem. 

It also ensures that as we and future generations continually choose new [[Seasonal Quests]] and engage with new teams in new places and times, everyone can get up to speed quickly, and interoperate across many [[Circles]]. 

Good [[Project Management]] is a cornerstone of the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]].
