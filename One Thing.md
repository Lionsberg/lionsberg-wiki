# One Thing

The [[Meta Idea]] of the [[LIONSBERG System]] and the [[Meta Project]] is that there is **One Thing** that unites us [[All]]. 

There is only [[ONE]] [[Meta Aim]]. There is only [[ONE]] [[Meta Goal]]. There is only [[ONE]] [[Meta Vision]]. There is only one [[Most Worthy Goal]]. 

We intentionally leave the Meta Level abstract rather than concretizing it, but we all have an innate intuition for what it is. 

Perhaps what unites us is (something like) Life and its Source. Perhaps it is (something like) [[Love]]. And if we Love [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]], then perhaps the overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] becomes (something like): 

*The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness.* 

If [[ONE]] is [[Love]], then that is the [[Meta Intention]]. 

What if we All actually worked together and helped [[One Another]] towards that [[The Goal|Goal]]? 

It would require that we forge the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] required to:

1) Solve the total set of [[Grand Challenges]] 
2) Accomplish the total set of [[Global Goals]] 
3) Forge the [[Best Possible Future]] in partnership with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

The [[One Thing]] is [[ONE]] and [[All]].
