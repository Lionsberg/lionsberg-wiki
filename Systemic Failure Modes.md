# Systemic Failure Modes

_The ways in which a system can fail due to inherent flaws or vulnerabilities within its structure, processes, or interactions. These failures are not isolated to individual components but arise from the complex interdependencies and interactions within the entire system. Identifying systemic [failure modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis) involves analyzing how different parts of the system can collectively lead to failures, often requiring a holistic approach to understand and mitigate these risks._ (Open Civics)
