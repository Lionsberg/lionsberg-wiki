# Meditation 55

Everything is a pattern. It is in the stacking and aligning of patterns that the symphony occurs. There is a universal pattern. There is a universal Wisdom. There is a universal Logos. When your being is aligned with the patterns, Wisdom, and Logos of the universe, you are in harmony. When we are All aligned, we are in symphony.
