# Availability And Priority Of Instantiation Domains

Important to the delivery of the [[Program]] is determining the **_availability and priority of sites / domains for instantiation of [[The Prototype]]**, and the opportunities and constraints each potential [[Domain]] brings.Â  

In addition to basic implementation challenges, these constraints include environmental challenges, political challenges, and social challenges. 

[[Potential]] Domains whose feasibility has been established will require various [[Mitigation Measures]] to **_ensure that the transformation of the local site helps, and does not harm, the existing ecology, culture, and community.
