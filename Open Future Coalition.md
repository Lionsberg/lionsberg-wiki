# Open Future Coalition

[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], Gary Glass, Kaitlin Archambault, and Jamaica Stevens brought together lifetimes of work and resources in 2021 to resource, design, and build a new empowerment platform that operates on top of a decade of technological architecture and development by Gary Glass. 

[[LIONSBERG]] funded the project as internal infrastructure for the [[Lionsberg System]], and OFC  facilitates the connection of organizations around the world through the outward facing Open Impact brand.
