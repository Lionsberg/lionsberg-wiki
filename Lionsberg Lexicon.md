# LIONSBERG Lexicon
*Definitions of Key Terms used throughout the [[LIONSBERG Universe]]*

To provide clarity and understanding, this section outlines key terms and concepts used throughout the book. Familiarizing yourself with these definitions will help facilitate a deeper grasp of the ideas presented in the [[New Vision and Plan]] and throughout the [[LIONSBERG System]].

It has been said that any given System can usually be described by under 150 key terms. Below is a sampling of key concepts in the [[LIONSBERG Narrative Universe]]. 

These concepts are explored in further detail and different formats in the [[The Lionsberg Co-Creator's Handbook]], the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], and the [[Above The Chaos]] series. 

This page is a [[Work In Progress]].
