# **🕊️** **The 144 Gates of Initiation**
_The Great ReFounding Journey — The Way Out of Bondage and Into the New Civilization_

## **Program Note** 

The idea of tying this to a three year cycle will move far too slow.  
We will unbound from Time to enable each individual and circle to move through at its own rhythm.  
Provide instructions to the individual  
Instructions to the circle  
Facilitators handbook 

## **I. The Nature and Function of the Gates**

The **144 Gates of Initiation** are not lessons to be learned nor doctrines to be believed.
They are **living thresholds** through which a soul, a people, or an entire civilization must pass
to emerge from the Old Order of bondage into the freedom of the New.

Each Gate is both **inner and outer**, **metaphysical and practical**.
To step through one is to change what is possible.
To walk them all is to be reborn—and to co-create the New World.

The Gates together form a **Bridge of Becoming** —
a sacred architecture by which any world can pass from fragmentation and kontrolle
toward coherence, freedom, and alignment with ONE and One Another.
They are the **Way of Exodus and Re-Foundation**,
the living protocol by which the false systems of domination yield
to the order of Truth, Justice, and Love.

---

## **II. The Essence of the Passage**

To enter the Gates is to agree to be transformed.

- **The Old Self and World dissolves; the New emerges.**
    
- **Each Gate unveils a deeper remembrance of Who and What We Are.****
    
- **The Journey reminds Us of Where We Are Going and Why**
    
- **Each Gate re-orders our relationships — with Self, with One Another, with Creation, and with Source.**
    

The process is experiential, embodied, and participatory.
No one can walk it for another.  
No one can walk it alone.  
Yet all who walk it together are drawn into One Rhythm, 
a shared momentum of liberation and re-creation.

---

## **III. The Great ReFounding Cycle — 144 Gates**

The 144 Gates unfold through **twelve Movements**,
a planetary rite of passage spanning roughly **three years**—
undertaken by each individual and community when they are ready—
one generation’s coordinated Exodus and Re-Creation.

When the last Gate is crossed, the people of Earth stand in Jubilee —
free, aligned, and capable of living eternally in the Way of Heaven on Earth.

### **The Twelve Movements**

1. **Awakening in the Caves of Kontrolle** — The first stirring of Truth within the shadow.
    
2. **Revelation of Bondage** — The Unveiling of the architecture of deception and kontrolle.
    
3. **The Cry of the Heart and the Call to Exodus** — The uprising of Spirit and Conscience and the conscious choice to depart.
    
4. **The Passage Through the Wilderness** — The purification and forging of character in adversity.
    
5. **The Great ReLearning** — Recovery of the lost arts and wisdom that sustain freedom.
    
6. **The Great ReBuilding** — Manifestation of the New Commons, the New Economy, the New Culture.
    
7. **The Gathering of Tribes** — The convergence of diversity into harmony and federation.
    
8. **The Covenant of the Commons** — The articulation of Justice, Stewardship, and Right Relation.
    
9. **The Consecration of the Kingdom** — Dedication of all labor, art, and life to the Divine Source.
    
10. **The Sacred War** — The defense of the Good without hatred; victory through Light.
    
11. **The Great Convergence** — The planetary synchronization of the liberated Body.
    
12. **The Great Jubilee and Eternal Divine Play** — The celebration of fulfillment and the opening into the eternal ascent.
    

Each Movement contains its own sequence of Gates  
weaving Spirit, Matter, and Civilization into one coherent transformation.

---

## **IV. The Principles of Passage**

1. **Experiential Reality** — Truth is proved in practice.
    
2. **Fractal Recursion** — Every scale mirrors the Whole.
    
3. **Right-Time Revelation** — Each Gate appears when ripe.
    
4. **Inner↔Outer Synergy** — Being and Building evolve as one.
    
5. **Mutual Uplift** — No Circle advances without strengthening others.
    
6. **Embodied Evidence** — Each Gate leaves a visible fruit.
    
7. **Covenantal Integrity** — Trust and right relation guard the Way.
    
8. **Guided by Grace** — The Power that moves it flows from ONE.
    


---

## **V. The Outcome of the Journey**

  When the 144th Gate is sealed: 

- The **people are free** — sovereign, healed, and reconciled.
    
- The **systems are just** — transparent, regenerative, and self-governing.
    
- The **world is consecrated** — each act of co-creation becomes worship.
    
- The **Jubilee dawns** — debt, guilt, and illusion dissolve in the Light of Truth.
    
- The **Sacred Ascent begins** — the civilization turns its face upward toward eternal transfiguration.
    

Every Circle becomes a **cell of Heaven**,
the planet a **living regenerative organism**,
each soul a **citizen of the New Kingdom**—
consciously co-creating in Eternity  
as [[The Sacred Ascent]] spirals upwards towards Perfection.

---

## **VI. The Relationship of the Paths**

| **Aspect**    | **The 144 Gates — The Great ReFounding**                                 | **The Sacred Ascent — The Eternal Cycle** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Function**  | Liberation and Re-Foundation                                             | Transfiguration and Continuation          |
| **Symbol**    | The Bridge across the Chasm                                              | The Mountain of Eternal Rising            |
| **Timescale** | Three-year cycle (species-scale Exodus in one generation)                | Spiraling octaves (eternal refinement)    |
| **Energy**    | Transformative and Collective                                            | Evolutionary and Subtle                   |
| **Focus**     | Liberating, healing and rebuilding civilization, regenerating the planet | Perfecting and elevating creation         |
| **Result**    | The New Civilization established                                         | The Kingdom continually perfected         |

Thus:

**When a world is lost or enslaved — the 144 Gates open.**  
**When a world is found — the Sacred Ascent continues.**  

---

## **VII. The Living Process**

Every Gate follows the same living rhythm:

- **Story** — a narrative vessel.   
    
- **Prime Insight** — a principle revealed.
    
- **Inner Practice** — a discipline of being.
    
- **Circle Practice** — a discipline of relationship.
    
- **Community Practice** — a discipline of culture.  
    
- **Quest** — an embodied act of co-creation.  
    
- **OmniSpection**  
    
- **Measure** — a reflection and offering of value.
    
- **Seal** — a ritual closure and vow to continue.
      

Through this rhythm, the invisible becomes visible,
and the great work of regeneration becomes measurable, tangible, and shared.

---

## **VIII. The Universal Law of Exodus**

The 144 Gates are the **cosmic protocol** by which any fallen world may be restored.
They are the same Way walked by many civilizations that have gained their freedom and risen from the ashes of corruption and kontrolle.

Their essence can be spoken in seven words:
**Awaken. UnVeil. Exit. Endure. Relearn. Co-Create. Consecrate.**

When these movements are lived in love and truth,
a New Civilization inevitably emerges —
not imposed from above, but co-created from the Spirit within.

---

## **IX. The Invitation**

To all who sense the stirring of Truth  
And are ready to begin:  

> The Gate is open.
> The Path is prepared.
> The Fire waits within you.

Form your Circle.
Read **The Story of LIONSBERG**.
Take the First Step.
Walk the Gates in rhythm with Creation.
Play the Great Game with Freedom and Joy.
Embody and Co-Create the New World.
And when All has been regenerated and made New —
continue the Eternal Sacred Ascent.

---

**“Behold, a Pattern spanning Heaven and Earth —**
**a Living Architecture unfolding in Time.**
**By this Way shall All things be made New.”**

The awakening spread. Those liberated in Spirit and Mind cry out for Freedom and Justice For All. Conscience awakens. The protocols of Exodus are established. Leaders and Circles begin forming. The first communities of trust light torches and prepare to leave the bondage of the Old World behind. The gates fling wide with Truth and a decisive crossing occurs—psychological, spiritual, and practical. Property, identity, and security once defined by the Old World are left behind in the Sacred Fire at The Gates. The people step across The Threshold of Knowing and Beyond The Boundary into the Unknown together. The pioneers make Way for The First Three Percent, and the tipping point strategy begins. As the entire population begins to be pulled out of The Caves, the Evil Empire strikes back. Backlash and pursuit. Forgotten allies and Divine helpers emerge from Beyond. In The Wilderness, in the midst of The Tents, The Sacred Flame is kept through the night.

## **The Threshold to the Eternal Sacred Ascent**

> As the final Gate is sealed, the mountain itself awakens.
> The path turns inward and upward — a spiral rising through eternal octaves.
> Thus the Journey that began in bondage becomes the Way that never ends.

### **Coda**

**When the Bridge is crossed, the Mountain rises.**
**When the 144th Gate is sealed, the Sacred Ascent begins.**

> _Thus Heaven and Earth are re-joined, and the Great Work continues forever._

### **Meta-Logic of the Movements**

- **Every Gate** is inner **and** outer: _Prime Insight → Practice (Self & Circle) → Quest → Measure → Seal._
    
- **Fractal & recursive:** the same pattern unfolds for individuals, circles, communities, and civilizations.
    
- **Measurable embodiment:** each Gate leaves artifacts—healed relationships, working commons, living law, art, gardens, tools.
    
- **Harmonic interdependence:** no Circle advances without strengthening others; waves help waves.
    
- **Guided by Covenant, moved by Grace.**
    

**Outcome:** By Gate 144, a people stands in Jubilee—free, healed, cohered, self-governing, regenerative—ready for the **Sacred Ascent** to refine the True Kingdom forever.
