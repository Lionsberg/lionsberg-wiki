# Everything Is A Project

In the context of the Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System, Everything is a Project is a convention that applies to all work performed across the distributed [[Team of Teams]]. This convention ensures that all [[Work]] done can be aligned into a [[System Wide Integrated Delivery System]], that is informed by the [[System Wide Master Plan]].  

The [[Everything Is A Project]] convention is a key component of the [[Lionsberg System]], as it allows for the integration and alignment of the efforts of individuals, teams, organizations, and communities towards a shared Vision. Rather than the master plan and program of action being top-down, they are guided from the "top" by an overarching and uniting Vision, Strategy, and set of Principles and Values, but informed and populated from the bottom-up based on the total set of projects and initiatives being generated by the distributed [[Team of Teams]] to progress towards shared our goals and values.

This standard requires that all work, no matter how small or large, be treated as a project. Each project must have a clear goal, objectives, timeline, budget, and resources. It must also have a clear plan for how it will contribute to the System Wide Master Plan and System Wide Program of Action, and how it will align with the shared Vision and shared goals and objectives.

By treating everything as a project, the Lionsberg System ensures that all work is aligned and integrated towards the shared Vision, and that all efforts are working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives. It also ensures that everyone has a clear understanding of the purpose and impact of their work, and that they can see the impact of their work on the broader ecosystem.  

Crucially, the Everything is a Project convention allows for the [[Work]] throughout the network of teams to be resourced through the combination of philanthropic, public, and investment resources available to the Lionsberg System as a Whole. 

The Everything is a Project convention also helps to ensure that all work is managed effectively, with clear accountability and oversight. It helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively, and that all work is completed on time, within budget, and to a high standard of Quality. 

In conclusion, the Everything is a Project convention is an essential component of the Lionsberg System, and is critical for ensuring that all work is aligned and integrated towards the shared Vision, and that everyone is working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives. By treating everything as a project, the Lionsberg System ensures that all work is managed effectively, and that everyone has a clear understanding of the purpose and impact of their work, both locally and globally.
