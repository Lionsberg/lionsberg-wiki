# The MP - Learning to Co-Operate the New System

Because the existing conditions on [[Worksite Earth]] included over 8 billion individual human beings, who ranged from newborn, helpless, and illiterate to enlightened, advanced, and spacefaring, it was recognized that each of 8+ billion humans beings would need to be met right where they were, wherever they were, so that they could learn to play their unique and important individual role in [[Co-Operating]] the [[New System]]. 

For this purpose, the [[Lionsberg Academy]] was established to ensure that every individual who connected to the [[Lionsberg System]] had access to a world-class pre-school through advanced university education, for free, alongside the modules that taught them the specifics of how to grow into every greater responsibility and participation in co-operating the [[Lionsberg System]].
