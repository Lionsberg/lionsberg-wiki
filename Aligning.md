# Aligning

The highest overarching and uniting Vision, Intention, and Goal is what integrates and aligns the System, and keeps all elements moving in the [[Wise Right]] direction. 

Each Individual, Group, and Community must be headed in the same overarching and uniting direction, towards the same overarching and uniting Goal. 

If we are not headed in the same direction, we will not be able to [[Help One Another]] along the path to get there. 

_Two cannot walk together unless they are aligned._

Therefore, all elements of the System must be integrated and aligned to the overarching and uniting [[Meta Intention]] and [[Meta Goal]].
