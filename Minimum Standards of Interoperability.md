# Minimum Standards of Interoperability

[[Work In Progress]]  

The Lionsberg System is designed to empower a holistic and integrated approach to addressing the challenges, opportunities, and threats facing humanity. 

It is designed to enable humanity to embody the [[New System]]. 

In order for the system to function effectively, it is important that all of its components are able to work together seamlessly and in harmony. 

To ensure this, the Lionsberg System has established a set of **minimum standards of interoperability** that must be met by all of its component systems in order for the Meta System to function properly at the Highest level of analysis. 

These standards are designed to ensure that all components of the Lionsberg System are able to communicate and share information and resources with one another, and to ensure that they are able to coordinate and collaborate effectively. They also help to ensure that the Lionsberg System is transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the community at every fractal level of implementation.

To meet these minimum standards of interoperability, all component systems must adhere to certain protocols and guidelines for governance, data exchange, communication, and collaboration. They must also be able to integrate with other systems and technologies as needed, and be flexible and adaptable in the face of changing circumstances and evolving Wisdom and discernment.

Overall, the minimum standards of interoperability help to ensure that participants in the Lionsberg System are able to function as a cohesive and integrated whole, while working together as [[One Body]] to  to effectively address the complex and multifaceted challenges facing humanity and the planet.

____
For the [[New System]] to function as designed, *something like* the following constitute the basic Minimum Standards of Interoperability. 

1. Love [[ONE]]. Love [[One Another]]. Love [[All]].  
2. [[Help One Another]], and [[Do No Harm]]  
3. Resources may only be applied to [[Value]] Producing and Aligned [[Quarterly Quests]]  
4. [[Quarterly Quests]] must [[Stack Up And Align]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]  
5. [[Quarterly Quests]] must be undertaken by [[Teams]].  
6. Teams may not be smaller than 3 or larger than 16, and [[Should Be]] 5 to 12  
7. Teams must be [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]]  
8. To function effectively as [[One Body]], [[Teams]] must co-operate and continuously improve the [[LIONSBERG System]]  
9. The [[First Tenth]] of [[Flow]] available to each node in [[The Ecosystem]] should be aggregated into [[The Commons]]  
10. Resources in [[The Commons]] should be allocated in the [[Wise Right]] Way to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

The fulfillment of these standards obviously demands a system of collective governance, decision making, and resource allocation at the level of The Whole.
