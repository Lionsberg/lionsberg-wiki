# 3.3 Contributing factors to the Meta Crisis

The Meta Crisis is not just the result of one or two isolated issues, but rather it is the result of a complex interplay of factors that have contributed to its development. Some of these contributing factors include:

-   Limited and corrupt global governance structures: Despite the efforts of international organizations and governments to address global challenges, there are still significant gaps in the ability to effectively coordinate and implement effective solutions in a fair and just way that addresses local, regional, and global scales and levels of analysis.
    
-   Lack of accountability and transparency: Many of the root causes of the Meta Crisis are tied to systems and structures that lack accountability and transparency, such as multinational corporations and financial institutions that prioritize profits over people and the planet, and governments that prioritize position and power over the wellbeing of those they are mandated to serve. 
    
-   Inequality: The Meta Crisis is not evenly distributed, and it disproportionately impacts poor, marginalized and vulnerable communities. This is due to a range of factors, including unequal access to resources and opportunities, systemic discrimination, intentional oppression, power imbalances, and systematic injustices.
    
-   Short-term thinking: Many of the decisions that contribute to the Meta Crisis are driven by short-term considerations, such as quarterly earnings or political cycles, rather than long-term sustainability and well-being, much less the eternal regeneration of our culture, values, ecosystems, and planet. 
    
-   Disconnection from nature: Many of the issues that contribute to the Meta Crisis, such as environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, are the result of a disconnection from nature and a lack of appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living things.
    
-   Technological advancements: While technology has the potential to be a powerful force for good, it can also contribute to the Meta Crisis if it is not used in a responsible and ethical manner, or if we weaponize it to exploit and oppress one another. This includes issues such as the impact of artificial intelligence on employment and the potential for technology to be used as a tool for control and oppression. 

- Lack of Guiding Vision, Philosophy and Values: All these issues fundamentally arise from a lack of guiding vision, philosophy, and values, whose role is to guide and instruct how we ought to wisely navigate towards our shared goals and objectives in a way that causes all living being to flourish in harmony.
