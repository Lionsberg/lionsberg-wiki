# 6.4 The need for a comprehensive New System and Approach

Recognizing that the systems that created the Meta Crisis cannot and will not be a solution to the Meta Crisis, a comprehensive [[New System and Approach]] is needed. This New System and Approach must be holistic, integrated and able to address the interconnectedness of the total nested hierarchy of dimensions of this crisis and opportunity. It must be able to leverage the strengths of a vast array of actors and sectors and coordinate their collective energy, resources, and efforts towards a shared goal. It must be able to adapt to the complexity, uncertainty and volatility of the current era and provide a framework for collaboration, innovation and the fundamental transformation of the human system. 

The Lionsberg System is an example of such a comprehensive system and approach. It is a [[New Operating System]] for humanity that empowers individuals and communities to help one another address their specific issues and pain points while also addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and working towards a shared vision and goal. The Lionsberg System is designed to be inclusive, just and regenerative for all, ensuring that the needs and perspectives of all members of society are taken into account, and all members of society have the opportunity to develop towards the fullness of their unique potential and flourish in harmony.

The Lionsberg System is built on principles of systems thinking, design thinking, and collective intelligence, which enables it to navigate and harness the complexity of the Meta Crisis and co-create a regenerative and flourishing future for all. It is a comprehensive and cohesive approach that brings together a vast array of actors and sectors to work towards a shared vision and goal, and it is inclusive and just for all people, as well as the entire Living System. 

In short, a comprehensive system and approach, such as the Lionsberg System, is crucial to effectively address the Meta Crisis and co-create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It is necessary to provide a framework for collaboration, innovation, and transformation that can navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and volatility of the current era.
