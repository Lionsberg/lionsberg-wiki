# Embodying The Abstract

While it was clear that all humanity inherently was a [[Meta Community]] engaged in a [[Meta Project]], whether we recognized it or not, it was also clear that _acting out_ this proposition would require that those abstract ideas descend and embody themselves in a discernible [[Time]], [[Space]], and [[Structure]]. 

Such a [[Federation]] would actually need to be able to relate to the world around it, gather and distribute resources, and speak and act as a Whole. 

This required creating a structural embodiment that could interface with existing legal, governance, nation state, and financial systems.
