# 2022.05.09 Request For Guidance

## Introductory Letter: 
May 9, 2022

Hello friends and allies, 

I find myself hesitant to reduce to written language all we have been discussing, as language can become a barrier or roadblock because we all use it so differently. Especially when we are communicating about the deepest and most meaningful things. 

And yet we must eventually reduce our plans to writing so we have something to evaluate, improve, and implement together. 

I am also struggling with the very fine balance of attempting to risk some of the leadership and direction that we all see is needed to coordinate and cohere the network, without stepping on the toes of the amazing people, projects, and perspectives that this unity is intended to elevate, coordinate and empower. 

My spirit is crying out that time is of the essence, and we need to move rapidly, now. 

So I am taking the risk of submitting this proposal to the network, advocating that over the next 8 weeks we do the hard work of forging a higher order functional unity among us that might actually be capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in this moment in history. 

Please bear this in mind as you read. If I use any language that is off-putting, or that you align with deeply, I would encourage us to forge a safe space for dialogue and sharing our deepest spirit, hearts, and minds… even as we stumble through the limitations of the written word. 

I am here entirely in service to Life and its Source, and if this plan meets your approval and we can resource it, I will take responsibility and dedicate myself entirely to seeing it through to success, so that we can all succeed and avoid failure at this critical moment. 

If we get this highest level federating right, everything else is possible. 

After the 1 page summary, the first ~10 written pages are the proposed plan of action for the next 8 weeks. The balance is additional information and context for anyone that wants to dive deeper. Beyond this are hundreds of pages of writing I can begin releasing if anyone cares :) 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J 

  

## Welcome 
Welcome to the Lionsberg | Meta Project

We really appreciate you being here. 

This is a [[Requests For Guidance]] on a proposed [[Plan of Action]] for the next 8 weeks. 
  
This is a living document submitted for your review and improvement. 

None of us has all the answers to how we might 
1. Solve the total set of Grand Challenges
2. Accomplish the total set of Global Goals, and
3. Co-Create a Flourishing World… 

But there is no “them” “out there” to do it for us, so here we go. 

The next step is to email your response and guidance to Jordan at J@Lionsberg.org.

# One Page Summary

At this unique moment in history, there are thousands of unique projects we could do, thousands of unique goals we could pursue, thousands of unique crises we could address…

Yet there is only One Meta Crisis, One Meta Project, and One Meta Goal…

And the only force on earth capable of succeeding, and avoiding failure, is One Meta Community… Focused on the One Thing that unites us all…

Working together to solve the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, and co-create the best possible future for all. 

Each of us holds a unique piece of the puzzle, yet in isolation we all lack the total set of skills, resources, and relationships required to truly transform the deepest root issues. 

We are proposing we overcome that by forging: 

1. A global Meta Community / Federation

2. Composed of sovereign individuals, organizations, communities, and institutions

3. Engaged in a shared Meta Project

4. To solve the total set of grand challenges and 

5. Accomplish the total set of global goals

This is a Request For Guidance on a proposed plan of action for the coming 8 weeks. 

The proposed next steps are: 

1) Formalize the gathering place where we can work on the One Thing that unites us all. 

2) Draft and adopt a minimum viable declaration / constitution that establishes right relationship among the sovereigns engaged in the federation. 

3) Resource the federation (Core Team and Infrastructure Fund), and the distributed network of high leverage projects (Impact Fund(s)), through the 501(c)(3).

4) Operationalize an Integrated Delivery System that creates throughput of the total nested set of goals. 

5) Advance the shared infrastructure platform that empowers the distributed network of autonomous sovereigns. 

While it may be optimistic, based on what has already been accomplished to date I believe we could accomplish these 5 steps in the coming 6 week cycle from May 22 to July 2, culminating in adopting the constitution on July 3. This would allow for resources to be transferred to the non-profit stewardship vehicle at the start of the Q3 cycle, and then the federation is live. 

The next step is to email Jordan at [J@Lionsberg.org](mailto:J@Lionsberg.org) addressing the 5 questions on page 13-14, and to forward this to the people you think most need to hear about it.

# Welcome

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

## History and Context

Two years into a decade that will be looked back upon as the most critical inflection point in human history, it is obvious that we are on the wrong track. 

No increased or accelerated amount of what got us here, will get us to where we want to go. 

The institutions we have looked to for leadership in the past have grown dishonest, corrupt and willfully blind.

We cannot identify anything in the existing field, that if we put the fullness of our being, weight and resources behind it and drive it to its logical end, will solve the total set of grand challenges and forge the better future we all desire. 

So…

We are working to help inspire the global community of goodwill to design and build itself… 

So that together we can design and build a better world. 

We are drawing on our experience in design-build and large scale infrastructure and technology development to propose a framework to unite and accelerate our currently disparate efforts. 

## A Comprehensive Solution

This is an attempt to articulate a comprehensive solution and plan of action that might actually be capable of solving the total set of grand challenges, accomplishing the total set of global goals, and forging the best possible future. 

It is rooted in the obvious realization that 1) unless we functionally unite our efforts, relationships, and resources, we will fail, and 2) that higher order functional unity must be accomplished through a decentralized yet coordinated and empowered community / federation of sovereigns engaged together in the One Thing that is bigger than any of us. 

## What

1) A global Meta Community / Federation

2) Composed of sovereign and autonomous individuals, organizations, communities, and institutions

3) Engaged in a shared Meta Project

4) To confront and overcome the total set of grand challenges

5) Accomplish the total set of global goals

6) And co-create the best possible future for all. 

## How

By inspiring a global community of goodwill to design / build / federate itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

## The Leading Domino

If we can forge a functionally unified community / federation, everything else is possible. 

If we fail to forge a functionally unified community / federation, we will fail. 

## The Purpose

1. Solving the Grand Challenges  
2. Accomplishing the Global Goals   
3. Co-Creating the Best Possible Future For All

## The Meta Goal

The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life in all times and places. 

## The Most Meaningful Joint Venture in History

When projects are too big for any one organization to accomplish in isolation, we set up a special purpose “joint venture” vehicle purpose-built for the project. This special purpose vehicle protects the sovereignty and autonomy of each participant, while affording the higher order functional unity pragmatically required to accomplish our shared goals. 

This critical moment in history will certainly require no less. 

It is not an option to treat this Meta Crisis with any less common sense, professionalism, and rigor than we would apply to any large scale human endeavor. 

## Everything We Need Is Available Within One Degree

Over the last several years, I have personally verified that everything we need to succeed and avoid failure in such an endeavor is available within one degree of our current network. 

## Acting As If It Were Our Responsibility

The only thing that is missing is for us, all, to decide to act as if it were our individual and collective responsibility to awaken, arise, and unite to confront and overcome the grand challenges, and forge a better world. 

## Perfectly Imperfect People on a Quest Towards the Goal

We are all imperfect people, without all the answers. However when billions of lives are at stake, we are fully capable of coming together to learn how to organize ourselves around our highest uniting quest towards the most worthy goal. 

Time is of the essence!   

What we do or fail to do in the next 7 years may determine what kind of world 7 generations to come either flourish or suffer in. It’s time to get moving. Here is what I see as the next 5 steps, for your review and approval or modification. 

The critical next 6 week cycle begins May 22, 2022, and we would love for you to be a part of it.

# Step 1: A Clean New Place Where We Can Work On The One Thing That Unites Us All

Parable: Starbucks rose by establishing a “third place” that was neither home nor the office. 

Application: We need to set up a new place that is not any one of the existing political parties, religious denominations, institutions, or organizations, purpose built as a place that we all can work together on the one thing that unites us. This bypasses the current dysfunctional mix of vested interests and political processes that are preventing truthful and effective speech and action at scale.   

Proposal: We spent several years exploring examples around the world, dialoguing with dozens of advisors, and conceptualizing, building, and operationalizing a hybrid governance solution purpose-built to accomplish this Meta Project joint venture. We would like to present this working prototype to the group over the coming weeks. If no one has already built and operationalized anything more appropriate, let’s use it as a starting point, fund it, and move. Jordan has been the sole funder and only board member, and it is ready to be organically complexified into a self-governing global community. 

Timing: 

Introduce / Evaluate the Work to Date: April to May 21, 2022

Complexify / Improve as Necessary: May 22 - July 2, 2022

Operationalize the Federation: July 3, 2022

# Step 2: A Minimum Viable Constitution

Parable: When 2.5 million people living in 13 colonies on the east coast of what we now call the United States decided that they needed to forge a higher and more perfect union among them, they gathered and articulated a constitution that became an example and beacon of hope for centuries to come.  E Pluribus Unum. Out of Many, One. 

Application: We need to establish a minimum viable constitution, with appropriate underlying agreement templates, that establishes right-relationship among the sovereign individuals, organizations, and institutions that become party to the Meta Project / Federation. Out of many, we need to become One, without sacrificing the sovereignty, autonomy, or freedom of any. We have been learning from what went right and wrong in already operationalized examples of federations such as the United States, the United Nations, Switzerland, Mondragon, etc.   

Proposal: This should be the core component of the 6-week cycle from May 22 - July 3. That gives us the next three weeks to identify and invite the right stakeholders to the table, then 6 weeks to work together to draft, iterate, and approve the minimum viable starting constitution, which we can continue to improve over time. 

Timing: 

Identify and Invite Stakeholders - April to May 21, 2022

Draft and Approve - May 22 to July 2 2022

Operationalize - July 3, 2022

# Step 3: Resourcing

Parable: When we set up a joint venture vehicle, based on the functions and performance required the stakeholders contribute to the special purpose vehicle the total set of resources and capabilities required to empower the vehicle to function in the manner needed. 

Application: Concurrent with drafting the constitution, we need to gain commitments from internal and external resource providers that if we can forge the federation, it will be adequately resourced at a level that will allow it to flourish and succeed. 

Proposal: Draft resourcing MOUs, and work to identify and gain commitments from resource providers. The most critical immediate need is to get a small core team and infrastructure fully resourced with the runway to drive this forward. If we do not identify a better methodology, initial resourcing can be stewarded by Lionsberg through its 501(c)(3) public charity, which can then resource and empower individuals and organizations that are aligned with its mission to design and build a better world. We propose to begin with two separate funds within the non-profit 1) Core Team and Infrastructure Fund, and 2) Impact Fund. The core team and infrastructure fund will allow a dedicated team to serve and coordinate the federation, and deliver on our overarching shared objectives. The Impact Fund(s) will address the multiple levels of philanthropic and investment capital that will be invested in the federated projects.

While we have developed hybrid structures that can allow for a blend of philanthropic and investment capital over time, because of 1) the early stage 2) the timing, and 3) to protect the purity of governance at the outset I would recommend that we fund this first stage solely through catalytic philanthropic contributions to the 501(c)(3), via the two designated funds proposed above. This structure is already in place and can be used immediately if it serves the federation well. 

**Core Team and Infrastructure Fund**: Secure $2M to $5M in philanthropic / grant capital to create the runway for a core team fulfilling the functions of 1) leadership, vision, strategy 2) operations / integration / coordination 3) administration 4) brand / messaging / communications 5) platform and technology 6) community, culture, relations. My intuition / experience is that we need to invest in a core full-time team of 5 to 7 people over the coming 6 months if we want this to really take root and be ready for scaling in the second half of the year. Experience shows that the core team and infrastructure to empower a complex distributed network usually runs around ~10% of the volume of the activity in the networked program of action.

**Impact Fund**: As the federation establishes critical path priorities and issues Requests for Guidance, sovereigns will propose high impact projects that advance us towards the global goals. Funds will be allocated by the team based on factors like 1) anticipated value creation 2) level of strategic importance 3) leverage 4) quality and track record of team 5) size of ask 6) time to results, and 7) replicability / ability to serve as a template / prototype. 

**Investment Funds**: Phase II will involve the networking and coordination / federation of multiple investment funds (Q3?).   

**Resource Ecosystem / Regenerative Economy**: Phase III will begin weaving funds, relationships and projects into a thriving regenerative ecosystem / economy. 

To build trust and transparency, I would recommend that we establish two or more hyper-credible sovereign financial advisory circles to oversee and provide total transparency into all financial aspects of the federation. These groups would independently report their findings out to the network, without first channeling them through the governance structure. We will need to be influencing the flow of billions of dollars within a relatively short amount of time, so establishing a network of independent checks and balances will be critical. 

Timing:

Draft MOUs - April to May 21, 2022  

Identify resource providers and sign MOUs - May 22 to July 2, 2022  

Transfer startup resources - July 3, 2022   

# Step 4: Operationalize Integrated Delivery System

Parable: When we build a bridge or a factory, we create a highest overarching and uniting system that transforms all the activities that will be undertaken into a unified goal delivery system.

Application: The “Core Team” responsible for serving and empowering the federation of sovereigns will be responsible for designing, building, and operationalizing an integrated delivery system purpose-built to produce throughput of our highest order overarching and uniting goal, along with the total nested hierarchy of local and global goals it implies. This will be accomplished through sovereigns focused on program and process management. 

Proposal: We have spent the last decades attempting to integrate learnings from business, economy, governance, entrepreneurship, construction, lean theory, spirituality, etc. into an integrated goal delivery system. We would like to present this work to the group over the coming weeks. If no one has conceptualized and operationalized anything better, let’s use it as a starting point and work together to continuously evolve / improve it. It is also purpose-built to work with the purpose-built legal, governance, and technological infrastructure.

Timing: 

Document / Diagram / Prepare Manual: April - July 2, 2022

Train, Operationalize, and Continuously Improve: July 3 - Forever  
  

# Step 5: A Platform To Empower The Distributed Network of Autonomous Sovereigns

Parable: On a worksite or in a company, it is critical to ensure that each of the specialized teams has the clarity, understanding, tools, and resources required to accomplish their unique piece of the project on time, on schedule, on budget. 

Application: Our constitution will protect the sovereignty of the individual and local, and ensure that each participant is protected from the power we are co-creating by federating. The role of the federation will be to ensure that each of the sovereigns is equipped and empowered with the tools, systems, services, resources, and knowledge required for them to solve problems, overcome challenges and advance towards the goal. We need to establish a platform that does this in the most effective and powerful way we can. 

Proposal Part I: In partnership through Lionsberg, Open Future Coalition, Collective Sense Commons, Catalist, Open Global Mind and others we have operationalized a minimum viable platform with the core capabilities required to coordinate, resource and empower a decentralized global federation of sovereigns. If no one has operationalized a more appropriate stack, I recommend we adopt and begin continuously improving the starting point we have co-created. 

Proposal Part II: Set up an ongoing and continuously improving process of 1) listening and discovery that reveals the needs / problems / roadblocks of each of the sovereigns 2) analyzing and prioritizing them 3) building a growing set of knowledge, solutions, services, and marketplaces as an interoperable “kit of parts” that can be locally accessed and adapted.

Proposal Part III: Set up an ongoing and continuously improving process of creating, verifying, packaging, and communicating value.  This “in stride” identification and verification of value creation at each fractal level will help fuel the ‘crowd funding’ of the total set of efforts required to solve the grand challenges and accomplish the global goals.

Timing: 

Design / Build / Operationalize Infrastructure and Technology: In Process

Listen / Discover Needs / Problems / Roadblocks: In Process

Articulate and Fund Roadmap: In Process - July 2, 2022

# What These 5 Steps Make Possible

If we can succeed in accomplishing these 5 steps over the coming two months, we will emerge into July with knowing that we are not only engaged together in perhaps the greatest and most meaningful quest in human history, but that we have a coordinated network, platform, a plan, and a measurable program of action that actually *might work*. 

The people already invited into and aware of this process are connected within one or two degrees to every relationship and resource we could possibly need to Solve the Grand Challenges & Co-Create a Flourishing World. 

Forging this higher order functional unity and a place where we can work together effectively towards the ONE THING THAT UNITES US ALL will ensure that we are not struggling or sub-optimizing in isolation, and that we have up to date visibility at all times into how we are doing on our highest shared quest towards the goal. 

# What Is At Risk If We Fail? 

 If we fail to take responsibility and act upon this opportunity, I do not see any way that the global goals will be accomplished, or the global crises solved.

If the global goals are not accomplished, and the global crises are not solved, I do not see any way that the world can avoid a descent into chaos. 

If the world descends into chaos, billions including our own children and grandchildren will suffer unnecessarily. 

# Next Step

We have begun to convene weekly meetings and distribute weekly communications regarding the Meta Community / Meta Project that we sense is trying to emerge. 

A few dozen of us are investing time in an introductory 6 week cycle that ends on May 22, 2022, with 50 to 100 waiting in the wings. As far as I can tell we are connected to everyone and everything we need. We just need to CHOOSE to make this happen.

Because of the highly critical need to protect the integrity and DNA of this experiment, we are currently only admitting people to the dialogue based on the personal recommendation of an existing participant. 

The simple next step is to respond to this Request For Guidance by

emailing Jordan at [J@Lionsberg.org](mailto:J@Lionsberg.org) addressing the following: 

1: What would make this proposed plan of action wiser and more likely to succeed? Do you perceive any core wisdom or principles that are being violated? Do you believe we are approximately on the right track? 

2. IF we were able to successfully forge a broad well-organized federation / joint venture... what are your primary needs or roadblocks at the individual / local / organizational level, and how could the federation best serve and provide value to you? 

3. IF we were able to successfully forge a broad well-organized federation / joint venture with the potential to actually move the needle on the grand challenges and global goals… What time, resources, skills, relationships, etc. would you be willing to offer to the federation / community?    

4. Would you be willing to 1) publicly endorse this process and proposed plan of action to begin building social proof, and / or 2)  engage in the 6 week federating cycle from May 22 to July 2, 2022? The minimum level of commitment is to read / watch the weekly communications, and add your wisdom to the dialogue as you feel called. After 6 weeks, we will each individually have the opportunity to opt in or opt out of the federation based on what we accomplish together.  

5. Who is missing 1) that you believe should be a part of this formational process and 2) you would be willing to recommend to the network?   

Please feel free to forward this to the people you think most need to hear about it. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I would be very grateful if you would be willing to take the time to respond. 

The world needs you. 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J 

P.S. there is no need to read any more, and for anyone who wants to dive deeper below is some additional guiding / aligning information. It is not easy to talk about the deepest things at the most critical moment in human history, so please forgive me for the rough attempt to create enough shared context and understanding as we discern together what is trying to emerge, and how to most wisely participate in co-creating it. 

  

# What is the Meta Project? 
The logic of the Meta Project is simple.  

## Context

The world is facing an unprecedented Meta Crisis. A Meta Crisis demands a Meta Solution. That solution will not come from any one existing institution or organization. There are many great people and organizations hard at work on parts of the solution, however we are currently operating inefficiently in parallel, and we are failing to make the measurable progress necessary to accomplish the global goals and secure a flourishing future for all. 

## Imperative

We therefore need to forge some kind of higher order functional unity that is actually capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in this critical moment in history. 

## Solution

When a problem or project is too big for any one sovereign institution or organization to solve in isolation, a special purpose vehicle is needed that affords the benefits of higher order functional unity across a large array of organizations, without sacrificing the sovereignty of autonomy of any participant. 

We are therefore articulating a vision and proposing a framework and process through which a new Meta Community / Meta Federation could design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

## Progress to Date

We have been attempting to execute on the critical path towards the Goal as best we could perceive it over the last several years. This led us to invest and sacrifice millions of dollars to co-create some foundational philosophical, legal, governance, process, and technological infrastructure. If it is useful to the network, it is available for use. If anyone else has created something better, let’s adopt it and advance! This infrastructure and the external timing factors aligned in 2022 to allow for a soft launch in Q1 / Q2, which commenced with a few dozen of us beginning to come together across the lines that usually separate us for a 6 week opening cycle to test the ideas. 

After the first 4 weeks, it was apparent that something significant was trying to emerge, and that there was enough commitment in the network to see this through. 

So we articulated some basic aligning statements, values, and imagery to hold space for the emergence.

These are still largely filtered by my voice, and do not yet necessarily reflect the shared voice of the federation. 

# Permission / Authority

A frequently asked question is (something like): How will we get the permission / authority to do something like this? 

The permission or authority is implicit in the ethical imperative. We are simply taking the risk to attempt to do what we see is necessary and feel morally impelled to do. This action is required because of the failures of the existing institutions and leadership, so we are not looking to them for permission. Time is of the essence. The authority flows directly from the Source, to we the people, who are then obligated to voluntarily organize and align ourselves to do what is required. The authority and credibility of the Meta Project will be established from within by those working on it. The more people participate and publicly endorse it, and the more measurable impact it causes, the more social proof it will have.  

# Basic Aligning Concepts

## The One Biggest Idea - The Meta Idea

At this unique moment in history…

There are a million unique projects we could do…

There are thousands of unique crises we could address…

Yet there is only One Meta Crisis…

There is only One Meta Project…

There is only One Meta Goal…

And the only force on earth capable of succeeding, and avoiding failure, is 

One Meta Community… Focused on the One Thing that unites us all…

Working together to confront and overcome the global grand challenges, and forge the better future that we all desire. 

The Meta Project is being purpose-built as a clean, new gathering place outside of the political, religious, and organizational structures that are currently dividing us, where we can All come together to address The One Thing of greatest worth and importance.

## Purpose

We are coming together to: 

Solve the Grand Challenges, and Co-Create a Better Future. 

Which grand challenges? All of them. 

Which future? The best possible one. 

Who? All of us.

## Conceptual Unity 

We are here at one moment in history, as one species, on one world. The Meta Project is intended to create a (space) outside the many organizations, political parties, and nations we may be engaged in where we can (all) focus on the crisis / opportunity of Worksite: Earth as a whole. 

## Spirit

The basic motivating spirit that brings us together is (something like) unconditional Love, which impels us to work together to relieve suffering and advance towards the betterment of all generations of life. 

## Goal

The ONE Meta Goal that contains within itself and orders all other goals is (something like): 

The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationships of all generations of life in all times and places.

## Project

The ONE Meta Project that contains within itself and orders all other projects is (something like):

The eternal and universal program of action to bring the Meta Goal into reality for all.

## Time and Place

The Meta Project is our attempt to act out / embody that spirit and program of action, here in this particular time and place as one human species on one planet earth. 

Now, in the shortest time possible. 

## Through

Autonomous-yet-coordinated individual and local cooperation towards our highest order shared goals and aspirations. This is made possible by adopting and acting out an interoperable pattern language. 

## Empowered By

Shared infrastructure, tools, wisdom, knowledge, resources, and relationships stewarded and continuously improved for the benefit of all. 

## Do No Harm

Without harming, exploiting, or disadvantaging any. 

## Potential

Co-creating a new world that is better for all than it has been for any in the past. 

## Values

The Meta Value that contains within itself and orders all other values is (something like): 

Virtue

Virtue is embodied through the fruit that flows from the spirit that does the wise right thing, at the right time, for the right reasons. In English, these manifestations are most often described by words such as:

Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Respect, Kindness, Goodness, Compassion, Acceptance, Forgiveness, Honesty, Fairness, Integrity, Courage, Faithfulness, Persistence, Responsibility, Patience, Self Control, Inspiration, and Spirituality or Transcendence.

And phrases such as: 

Help, and do not harm one another.

Do unto others what you would want others to do unto you.

Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you. 

If you know what is good, right, and helpful, do it. 

If you know what is bad, wrong, and harmful, do not do it.

Love the Source and Sustainer of life, love your self, and love others as you love yourself.  

Take care of your self. Take care of others. Take care of the Whole. 

These words and phrases are all well known representations of the basic “law” written on the hearts of all people of goodwill. 

## Anti-Values

The Anti-Values flow from the spirit that harms and exploits others for its own benefit, position, or power. 

## Diverse Expression

Central to flourishing and abundant life and culture is the celebration of the diverse and unique expression of what is honorable and good, and the unique ways in which it is embodied in various people, cultures, times, and places. 

The aim is to weave together and cultivate a diverse ecosystem of unique individual and local expression of our highest central animating spirit, not a monolith. 

## God, Politics, and Ideologies 

For people of faith and spirituality, the concepts at this highest Meta level are inextricably seated in the realm of the Divine, as they pertain to our fundamental relationship to life, consciousness, and its Source. 

For people of certain political or ideological backgrounds, the topics inherent in the Meta Project are often nested within different fundamental systems of thought, religion, or politics. 

The Lionsberg | Meta Project was specifically conceptualized as a clean white gathering place where people of goodwill could come together beyond the religious, political, and national lines that usually divide us, to focus on the One Thing that unites us all. 

This requires us to create a culture that celebrates and invites respectful dialogue and inquiry about the mysteries of God, spirituality, and various systems of thought, without imposing religious or dogmatic beliefs upon one another. 

## No State Religion or Ideology

There is no state religion or ideology in the federation, even as we each attempt to center ourselves around and be led by the highest and most transcendent wisdom and perspective we can possibly relate to.

## Freedom of Thought and Speech

As we come together to dialogue and act upon the matters of greatest significance to billions of people, we must actively preserve an environment of absolute freedom of thought and speech so that all sovereigns speak as truthfully and accurately as they are capable of about what they discern and perceive.

## A Voluntary Community of Sovereigns

The higher order functional unity we are striving towards is built entirely upon the freedom, sovereignty, and voluntary association of each individual, organization, and community. Every sovereign is free to leave at any time. 

## Core Standards of Interoperability and Cooperation

We are working together to articulate and help one another rise up to the core standards that enable various levels of interoperability and cooperation across a diverse federation. 

## The Great Banquet

Until our culture and process have been forged, a basic rule of thumb is to act as if we were guests being welcomed into a dinner party. All are welcome, all are loved, and the host reserves the right to ask anyone to leave who is not being kind, courteous, and gracious to all. 

# Context & Problem

The Meta Project was created for One very simple, universal, and critical purpose. 

To confront and overcome the total set of local and global and grand challenges we are facing, and co-create the best possible future for All. 

That is the One, single, universal, eternal uniting Meta Project. 

Until now, we have lacked a framework and a space for this level of thought and action. 

It is a simple concept that only seems impossible because it has never been done. 

We believe that we are all present, together, at what will be looked back upon as the greatest inflection point in human history. We, who are present together in this decade, will be looked back upon as the ones who decided, or failed to decide, what kind of future and what kind of world that generations to come will either suffer or flourish in. 

There is no “them” “out there” who has this handled. There is no “them” coming to save us and sort it all out. It is up to us, now, in partnership with God and One Another, to co-create the better world that we all desire and believe is possible.  

Since that ethical imperative is far too significant and overwhelming for any individual, organization, or institution to tackle in isolation, that means that we need to forge some kind of higher order functional unity that is actually and pragmatically capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in every community of life at this moment in history. 

We need to arise and become (something like) a Meta Community, engaged in a Meta Project, to accomplish the Meta Goal, for the Highest and Greatest Good of All. 

While that may be regarded as an impossible task to succeed in, we know for certain that we will fail if we do not try, and the cost of failure is suffering for billions of people. Everything in history was impossible until it happened. This is an attempt to forge a *starting point* that *might work*. 

## Humanity’s Progress 

Over the past few centuries, humanity has made tremendous progress. From science and technology to infrastructure and organization, new advancements have allowed us to double the average human lifespan, establish global systems and infrastructure, and connect with one another in ways that we never dreamed possible. 

## Mistakes and Consequences

Yet it is becoming ever more apparent that many of the hastily erected structures and solutions of industrialization, governance, globalization, and capital are pushing humanity and our planet to the brink. 

The very systems we stood up to solve our most pressing threats in previous centuries, while immensely effective in so many ways, are now creating entirely new classes of existential threats. 

Despite our progress, it remains the sad reality that approximately:

1 in 2 of our family members on earth live without essential health services.

1 in 4 live without adequate sanitation and clean water

1 in 4 live without adequate housing

1 in 6 live in poverty

1 in 9 suffers from hunger 

1 in 9 has less than 6 years of education

Tens of millions have been displaced by violence, persecution, and violations of our basic human rights. 

The population sizes of mammal, bird, fish, plant and insect species have fallen by approximately ⅔ in just the past 50 years.

The vast majority live week to week, in continual anxiety and fear that some form of existential threat will manifest itself. 

We are caught between the desire and necessity to be grateful for the tremendous unearned benefits some of us enjoy today as a result of humanity’s efforts to date, and the necessity to face the harshest realities of our current unnecessary suffering, and the potential social, political, and environmental collapse that loom on the horizon. 

## The Meta Crisis

By 2022, we found ourselves face to face with an entire complex of interrelated crises, and many more concealed right beneath the surface waiting to arise. Wars, rumors of wars, famine, plagues, injustices, oppression, poverty, riots, economic distortions, environmental catastrophes…

Yet what if…

The crises we can easily identify were not the deepest issues, but rather symptoms flowing from a far deeper root cause? 

What if the visible crises were all flowing from the mouth of one Meta Crisis? 

And what if that Meta Crisis was at risk of growing exponentially worse as advances in technology, science, and industry accelerate us down their current trajectory? 

## Official Responses

As the threats have grown steadily more visible, organizations like the United Nations and many other national and international bodies have taken valuable first steps towards identifying shared global goals, values, and statements of rights and responsibilities, and advocating that we move together towards them. 

From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to the UN Global Goals, to the numerous alternative frameworks and models, as a species we have been able to articulate and broadly affirm our universal rights, our universal responsibilities, and our basic universal aspirations.

Yet at this unique moment in history when we urgently need to work together in the most excellent manner possible to solve the complex of crises bearing down upon us, we find ourselves in a fragmented and dysfunctional social and political environment. 

Our political parties are at war, our nations are at war, our religious denominations are at war, our institutions are at war, the halls of power are dominated by corruption and fear, and it is evident that the existing structures of organization and leadership have very little risk of achieving success and avoiding failure in the time required. 

The institutions and leadership that we have looked to in the past for leadership are obviously failing to forge the higher order functional unity that is needed to address these issues and co-create the best possible future for All. And time is running out. 

## Individual and Local Responses

Against this backdrop, local governments, institutions, individuals, and organizations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars and volunteering billions of hours every year in tireless attempts to solve the problems they are facing locally and beyond. 

Yet despite the heroic efforts of so many brilliant individuals and organizations around the globe, many of these efforts are running inefficiently in parallel, competing for the same resources, and lacking the basic coordination and transparency needed to create the systematic transformation that is required. 

Additionally, it is growing increasingly obvious that isolated individual and local successes will not last if the total system falters. It is not possible to be a healthy organ in a dead body. 

## Our Future Will Be Dramatically Different Than Our Past

We are staring into a very uncertain future that we know will be dramatically different from our past. 

In moments like these, it is one thing if we are present, together, united in one vessel of society, staring boldly over the horizon, insisting upon and navigating courageously towards our best and highest potential future. 

It is quite another thing if we are separated. If we are divided. If we are competing over artificial scarcity. If we are slandering and deceiving one another. If we are at war. 

We know from our wisdom traditions and personal experience that no individual, no house, no organization, no community, no nation, no world, and no living system divided against itself can stand. It is a simple spiritual and physical reality. 

Yet here we collectively stand, divided. 

## Without Uniting Vision and Values, People Perish

We know from our wisdom traditions and our personal experience that without a highest overarching and uniting Vision, people perish… Without a highest overarching and uniting Structure of Values, people disintegrate… Without a highest overarching and uniting Goal we are striving together to Realize, it is not possible to experience the success and positive emotion that come with progress towards a Worthy Goal or Ideal. 

We know psychologically and spiritually that without an overarching and uniting structure of meaningful values and goals we are damned to a perpetual spiral of anxiety and fear. 

## Changing the Trajectory

When we are all aboard ONE Vessel of Life and Society, and only 25% to 30% of us believe we are headed in the right direction, it is time to awaken, arise, unite, grab the helm, and change the trajectory before it is too late. 

# The Opportunity

## Cause For Hope

Despite the obvious existential threats ahead, there is tremendous cause for hope. 

History has shown us that when we work together, we can achieve things that appeared entirely impossible until we accomplished them. 

We have built cities, nations, roadways, infrastructure, systems, and technology that have transformed every aspect of culture and commerce, and even taken us beyond the earth.

Whether it is building infrastructure, sending a rover to Mars, or vanquishing a disease, success at the largest scales requires world class coordination, logistics, and training. 

## The Imperative

Confronting and overcoming the current global complex of crises, and forging the better future we all desire, will require no less. 

## We The People 

We are “out there”, billions strong, with common sense, common values, and the uncommon courage to arise, unite, and do something… if only we knew where to go, what to do, and who to do it with. 

And for the first time in human history, we have the entire set of tools, technologies, and knowledge required to find one another, bridge our divides and move together across the lines that formerly divided us. 

This gives rise to the greatest opportunity and the greatest hope in human history. 

It is time for a transcendent and uniting new vision, set of values, and plan of action that elevates, transforms, and aligns our lives, our organizations, our communities, and our world. 

For the first time in human history We The People simultaneously have the infrastructure, technology, knowledge, awareness, and the ethical imperative to awaken, arise, and unite to land humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the better future we all desire.

## Navigation and Hope

While we can certainly all see that from where we are today it is possible to navigate towards somewhere far, far worse… 

The good news is that it is also possible to navigate together towards a future that can be better in every way, for everyone, than the past we are leaving behind. 

## Timing 

The timing could not be better, because now, this decade, is the time we must move together with enough power and progress to ensure that we are on the right trajectory, and there is no chance of failure. The lives and wellbeing of All are at stake. Let’s not delay. Let’s not fail.

# The Meta Solution

## One Meta Community, Indivisible… Engaged in One Meta Project

We have spent the last several years bringing together lifetimes of work and value to co-create the basic philosophical, legal, governance, technological, systems, and process infrastructure required as a *starting point* to inspire and empower a Meta Community / Meta Federation of sovereign individuals, organizations, localities, and nations to design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

The solution is One Meta Community, engaged together in One Meta Project, whose sole purpose is to help one another progress towards the Highest Intention / Greatest Good / Full Potential / Best Possible Future for All. 

This Meta Solution by definition contains within itself and orders the total set of all other solutions required to realize the best possible future for all. 

It is therefore the only possible solution to the Meta Problem, which by definition contains within itself the total set of all other problems and obstacles standing in our way. 

While at first this may sound abstract, overwhelming, or impossible, addressing the problems and solutions as a conceptually unified total set actually has the benefit of dramatically simplifying the problem, and allowing us to solve the Meta Problem and produce throughput of the Meta Goal with a dramatic reduction in time and energy. 

At this moment in history, that literally means the difference between life and death for billions of living beings. 

## How It Works

The purpose of the Meta Project is to create an identifiable, clean, sacred space where we can come together above the political, religious, national, and organizational lines that usually divide us to Help One Another progress towards the ONE THING that unites us All. 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System operates by integrating and transforming any program of action into a single higher order Goal Delivery System, while helping and empowering each sovereign element and sub-goal. 

By applying this logic out to the highest level of conceptual abstraction, we are empowered to deal with the harshest realities of the problems we face as they actually are. 

From the starting point of fiercely protecting individual and local sovereignty, culture, and belief, we are assembling an integrated solutions stack and proven methodology that elevates and empowers Sovereigns to voluntarily and effectively coordinate, fund and deliver local and global goals. 

The process is centered around continuously improving the Community Relationships, Process, and Culture of the Meta Community engaged in the Meta Project. By centering the Meta System around the central animating Spirit that is constant across all transformations, individuals, organizations, institutions, and technologies can come and go over time while all benefiting from a continuously improving, multi-generational ecosystem.  

This single, unified, highest order framework precipitates the Potential of discerning the highest uniting wisdom, intention, and values, and then Operationalizing that shared understanding into tangible, pragmatic, and coordinated progress towards the Meta Goal. 

With transparency into who we are, what we are doing, where we are, how we got here, where we are going, and why… 

…and where there are unmet needs, unsolved problems, or roadblocks… 

Individuals and localities can engage a higher order Meta Process that resources high-leverage projects against quarterly sprints, while benefiting from the resources, relationships, and assistance of the Meta Community. 

Core aspects of the integrated solutions stack include Community, Funding, Governance, Shared Infrastructure, Shared Services, Coaching and Mentorship, Coordination, Process, Transparency, Measurement, Healing, Conciliation, and Incentives. 

# Elements of a Flourishing World

The core aspects mentioned above are just a few high level categorical requirements.

However there are hundreds or thousands of additional requirements that need to be articulated, designed, and built. 

If our highest uniting Meta Goal / Meta Intention was (something like) a renewed world in which all generations of life, in all times and all places, were helping one another develop into the fullness of their potential and flourish… 

We would have to design and build the total set of solutions, services, and infrastructure that empowered every individual and local community on earth to climb towards that destiny. 

Our early efforts to brainstorm the core components turned up necessary elements of the system such as (feel free to skip the next 230 bullets if you are not interested in that level of detail - they are relatively unprocessed): 

1.  A prototypical and continuously improving “Kit of Parts” that meets the needs and solves the problems inherent in every community of life, and which can be adapted and localized to each individual area, while maintaining interoperability.
    
2.  A well-stewarded “commons” that empowers and enriches a distributed network of sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities. 
    
3.  A well-stewarded and healthy data model that empowers and enriches a distributed network of visualizations, platforms, tools and apps. 
    
4.  Beautiful and diverse visualizations and maps of the underlying data
    
5.  A system of distributed citizen mapping
    
6.  A system of distributed citizen science
    
7.  A system for distributed citizen research
    
8.  A system of distributed citizen journalism
    
9.  A system of distributed citizen dialogue and discourse
    
10.  A system for making sense and navigating in local, regional and global community.
    
11.  A system of distributed citizen art, orality, visuality, sensuality, and experience.
    
12.  A system of distributed citizen self-organizing
    
13.  A system of distributed citizen governance
    
14.  A uniting system of diverse meaning and mythology
    
15.  A uniting system of diverse culture
    
16.  A uniting system of diverse rhythms and rituals
    
17.  A system of lifelong learning and development that empowers each individual to rise to the fullness of their unique potential and flourish
    
18.  A system of lifelong learning and development that empowers each organization to rise to the fullness of its unique potential and flourish
    
19.  A system of lifelong learning and development that empowers each community to rise to the fullness of its potential and flourish
    
20.  A system of lifelong learning and development that empowers each tribe and nation to rise to the fullness of its potential and flourish
    
21.  A system of overarching community and belonging
    
22.  Robust and continuously improving shared infrastructure, tools, and technologies
    
23.  Robust and continuously improving templates and patterns so we were not always reinventing wheels
    
24.  Robust, continuously improving, interoperable, and dendritically connecting marketplaces and ecosystems of all kinds
    
25.  A basic set of “utilities” that empowers every individual, organization and community
    
26.  A system for raising and allocating resources in small groups and communities
    
27.  A system for creating local and sector marketplaces
    
28.  A system for connecting local and sector marketplaces
    
29.  A system to activate stagnant resources and disincentivize hoarding
    
30.  A system to create more equal opportunity and access to resources
    
31.  A system to foster organic flow of resources to the right places, at the right times, for the right reasons
    
32.  A system to seed, incubate, accelerate, mature, and replicate the best ideas and prototypes
    
33.  A system to match the right resources, relationships and ideas, at the right time, to emergent individuals, organizations, and communities.

# One Integrated Goal Delivery System

While it is indeed overwhelming and redundant to look at all those elements in isolation, when we look at them as a single totality it becomes entirely possible to deliver the total set, in this generation, by transforming the entire program of action into a single, unified, decentralized goal delivery system that creates throughput of the entire set. 

The key is to start with the Meta Idea. 

# To Know The Way, One Must Live It

There is a saying in various martial arts and spiritual traditions that “to know the Way, one must live it.” 

This white paper is an attempt to distill centuries of concepts from a variety of different disciplines and fields into a unified system that can show us the Way towards the Goal. 

If it seems overwhelming and impossible, would you be willing to trust me and commit to a couple 6 week cycles and see what happens? 

# Images and Metaphors to Hold the Meta Idea

Below are a few metaphors and questions to help hold the space of the One Idea…

1.

If there are 1,000 Existential Threats flowing from the mouth of one Meta Threat, what do you do? You must confront and overcome the Meta Threat. 

If the myriad of crises and threats we are facing were not the deepest issues, but symptoms of a far deeper Meta Issue… What is the deepest Meta Issue? 

2. 

If you need to do 1,000 projects, but can only focus on one thing, what do you do? You must create and succeed in a Meta Project which encompasses them all in One higher order program of action. 

If the myriad of projects that need to be done were not the ultimate project, but elements of a far greater Meta Project… What is the highest uniting Meta Project? 

3. 

If you need to produce 1,000 parts to create each automobile, what do you do? You must create a Single Unifying System that encompasses them all while optimizing throughput of completed automobiles. 

If the myriad of elements and parts we are producing were not the ultimate goal, but elements of a far greater Meta Goal… What is the highest uniting Meta Goal? What is it that we are trying to create throughput of as a human species on planet earth? 

4. 

If a project is too large, risky, or complex for any one organization to tackle in isolation, what do you do? You must forge multiple distinct organizations into a higher order functional unity. 

What would an ultimate Meta Joint Venture look like? 

5. 

On a large joint venture, hundreds of different organizations and specialists come together and collaborate to bring One, single, overarching Design Intention into Reality. 

What if we did the same for [Worksite: Earth]? 

6. 

If we are steering the vessel of society through the generations towards Where We Are Going, what is the One unchanging Meta Goal / North Star by which we chart our course? 

What are we navigating through the generations towards? 

7. 

If we are navigating towards our Destiny and we discover that our maps contain different and conflicting information, what must we do? We must compare and forge a Meta Map. 

8. 

Who is included in All? Who is excluded from All? Who is hardest to include in All? 

9. 

What is the One Thing that unites the many? 

10.

What is the One Thing of greatest value and worth? What is at the absolute top of a unified and coherent Structure of Values? 

11.

What is the One Meta Good that contains within itself and orders all other Goods? 

12.

What is the One Meta Value that contains within itself and orders all other Values? 

13. 

If we wanted to plant one tiny seed, that although small in the beginning, could grow into a mighty forest in which all the creatures of the earth from refuge and abundance, what would the DNA of that One seed need to be?

14. 

If all life on earth were to manifest itself as a symphony, what is the One fundamental tone we would all need to attune ourselves to? 

15. 

If all life on earth were to manifest itself as One organism, how would it organize itself? What is the role of the human species in the greater Whole that contains it?  

16. 

Whose responsibility is it to Realize the One uniting Meta Goal of Greatest Worth?
  

# What to Expect

## An Experiment

We are in the emergent stages of a somewhat unprecedented social experiment / experience. It might work. If you are looking for perfection or all the answers, you are in the wrong place. 

## An Imperfect Community on a Quest

You can expect to be engaged in a community of imperfect people, without all the answers, learning together how to organize ourselves around and progress towards our single highest uniting intention and goal. 

You should expect to be welcomed. To be loved. To be safe. To be respected. To be seen. To be known. To be heard. 

## Adventures, Obstacles, and Enemies

As we embark on this Quest, the one thing that we know for certain is that we have no idea of what adventures, obstacles, and enemies lie ahead. 

As we untie our vessels from the docks of the Old, and venture out towards the New, the one thing we know for certain is that we have no idea what obstacles, adventures, and enemies will arise to object to our progress towards the Goal. 

What we do know is that we must work together to become the kinds of people, working together in the kinds of organizations and communities, that can confront and overcome whatever obstacles dare to arise and challenge us. 

Therefore the entire Meta Process is rooted in helping one another orient ourselves and wisely navigate towards our goals, in a way that helps us all become the kinds of people we need to be in order to achieve success, and avoid failure, in the most important thing. 

## ~ 6 Week Navigation Cycles 

Over the coming weeks, you can expect us to engage in a process of focusing on solidifying the DNA of the starting group, and orienting ourselves on an ongoing basis to: 

1.  Intention: The Highest Uniting Intention and Goal, and its subcomponents
    
2.  Analysis: Analyzing / Mapping Where We Are / What Elements Are Present
    
3.  Engagement: Engaging partners and resources required to advance 
    
4.  Planning: Developing wise, written, fundable, measurable plans of action
    
5.  Action: Making and keeping commitments to one another based on the sequence, priorities, and needs we discern. Acting with courage and perseverance in the face of the challenges and obstacles we know will arise. 
    
6.  Continuously Learning and Improving: Elevating and transforming ourselves so that we get a little better every day. 
    

## Every ~6 Weeks

We will repeat this navigation / discernment process approximately every 6 weeks, reaffirming the criteria and commitment for those who want to continue to participate, and wisely discerning who and what to add, for what reasons, to progress towards the goal. 

The 6 week cycles break the quarterly / seasonal cycle in half for more rapid pulsing, and will themselves be broken down into shorter sprints by the autonomous teams advancing. 

## Temporary Perceived Scarcity

Within one degree of the initial starting group is every relationship or resource we could need. Yet until we assemble them and bring visibility to the latent gifts and resources among us, we are going to be grappling with artificial / perceived scarcity. There is way more time and money out there than great ideas. The scarcity will be overcome with abundance. However there is always a desert that lies between captivity and the promised land. 

## The Math of Movements

Movements, like communities, start very small. Despite the tiny beginning, depending on how the math unfolds it is only between 33 and 50 expansion cycles to sweep past 8 billion. What if, within 50 cycles… X 6 week intervals… = ~300 weeks = ~ 6 to 7 years, every human being on earth received a personal invitation, from someone they trust, to activate their equal share of an emergent community of great benefit and worth that could help them elevate and transform their life and their world? 

This is an entirely mathematically feasible and historically proven potential. The only prerequisite is uniting ourselves, All, in service of One Thing, and then executing our unique and local individuals parts to help one another realize the Meta Goal. 

# Thank You

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we learn how to do this together. 

May we be good stewardships and cultivate, in a Spirit of Love, the new life that is longing to emerge. 

I believe that this approach, as continuously elevated, transformed, and improved by a growing community, represents the last best chance we have for succeeding, and avoiding failure, as a species at this unique moment in history aboard Earth. 

It means the world to me, literally, to have the opportunity to be in community with you, and labor together in service of the highest intention and greatest good. 

If we can come together in some kind of higher order functional unity that is actually capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in this moment in  history, everything else is possible. 

I am here entirely in service of the One Thing, and I trust you are too. 

Let’s move together. 

The next step is to forward this to the people who need to see it, and email me @ [J@Lionsberg.org](mailto:J@Lionsberg.org). 

# A Personal Story For Those Who Asked

I have been asked by some for information on who I am and how I got here. 

First of all, this has nothing to do with me. 

My entire being is oriented to aligning myself as fully as I can with the Source and Sustainer of life and consciousness, and operating as a conduit of that Spirit. 

I was born in 1984 in Orange County California, one of wealthiest and most beautiful pinnacles of the free world. I was raised in the Judeo-Christian tradition and steeped in American and Biblical values, and the teachings of Jesus. 

From the earliest moments that I could grasp that eternal heart of unconditional love, I could see that something was dramatically wrong with our society. I could see that while we proclaimed to uphold certain values, our society was manifesting itself in a way that was far divorced from them. 

Although I had no idea what to do with that awakening realization, it was obvious to me that during my lifetime, a generational movement would be required to arise and unite to defeat the corrupt illegitimate authoritarian impulses, and restore the proper order and balance of the world for the coming generations. 

I had a vibrant spiritual experience from the time I was young, and a vibrant sense of the battle of Good and Evil in my own soul and in my world. When I was 11 or 12, the words of Solomon in Proverbs grabbed me and never let go. The vivid language describing the pursuit of wisdom as a quest towards a holy grail more valuable than gold or silver thrust me on a deep life-long search for wisdom and understanding. The more wisdom was revealed to me, and the more I came to understand the present reality of the world, the more clear the tremendous chasm between the best and highest that was intended, and the existing forces and conditions, became clear.

Over time God was kind enough to validate what I was experiencing internally with many external messages and confirmations that helped guide my course. 

When I was 14, and she was 13, my wife and I connected and we were inseparable by our freshman year of high school, united from the start by our shared deep sense of mission and calling. We found ourselves intuitively calling each other up towards a higher purpose. 

Although my immediate family had sacrificed a life of privilege to serve our community in ministry, the wealth of my extended family privileged me to receive some of the best training and education available in the world, from private secondary school, to a bachelor's degree from Pepperdine’s Graziadio School of Business, to an MBA from UCLA’s Anderson School of Business, to multiple black belt degrees in martial arts. I obtained these primarily on nights and weekends while working full time. 

Early on I resolved to prepare for whatever I might be called upon to do by lifting the heaviest burdens I could bear and taking on as much responsibility as anyone would entrust me with. 

Torn between the path towards spiritually significant work and serving the community, and success in the economic and political systems, I realized the limitations of both and the false dichotomies that were plaguing our society. 

As I continued to be entrusted with ever greater responsibility I progressed from early service jobs, to early entrepreneurial activity coaching in academics and music, to helping manage infrastructure projects, to managing infrastructure projects, to managing portfolios of infrastructure projects, to managing joint venture infrastructure projects too big for any one company to complete in isolation, to building companies that built infrastructure projects, to beginning to assemble a portfolio of companies, to innovating legal and governance structures in anticipation of giving those companies away into multi-generational stewardship vehicles, to beginning to look at Worksite: Earth as a whole… 

…to having my youthful naivete shattered by the corruption and abuse of power plaguing our government and religious institutions, to speaking truth to power, to inevitably losing our home, company, reputation, over $10M of wealth, and 150 of our co-workers losing their jobs at the hands of corrupt authorities who turned their backs and washed their hands of the corruption they were callously and willfully blind to… 

Along the way I got to see the way politics, wealth, and religion mixed into unholy alliance, the special deals that got made behind closed doors, the way governments and developers interacted with public and environmental concerns, the terrible incentives that rippled out from corrupt and unwise legislation, the way politics dominated corporate life, the way blue collar workers were exploited and oppressed, the fear and week to week scarcity that held good people in terrible positions, the sacrifices that people made to climb ladders of hierarchy that were entirely antithetical to their core values, yet which they depended upon for their position and prosperity. 

Over the years as wealth and influence increased I was faced with and complicit in every trial and temptation common to men. As I battled to stay on course and fight my way through the tests, my marriage nearly failed, I inflicted and suffered painful wounds, and continued to strive towards the light as best I could in my various states of immaturity and naivete. 

Looking back I can see that I have been guilty in some shade of every vice, and have been entirely complicit in all the worst sins of our society as a result of my naive participation in it. 

What is clear to me now, having battled through the underworld and emerged scarred and stripped of an old life, yet stronger, clearer, and hopefully wiser than ever, is that I would be betraying my soul if I continued to lend my time and energy to struggling inside of the systems that promise safety and luxury as a millionaire to a few, while billions suffer outside the gates. I came to the very uneasy realization that the entire patterning of modern society was wrong, on a trajectory towards massive failure that was entirely incompatible with the vision and values shared by all people of goodwill. 

I realized that the entire human system had to be fundamentally elevated, revivified, transformed into something new, that was entirely reintegrated with the living system of earth and the timeless wisdom, principles, and values that cause people, societies, and living systems to flourish. 

And I realized that the same was true of me as an individual human.

Several years ago, in partnership with God and the wisest advisors I could find, I began to look seriously at Worksite: Earth as a whole. As if it was a single domain, and as if we were responsible for its stewardship and transformation into a flourishing and abundant place in which generations to come could thrive. 

I was introduced to coaches and advisors who helped me navigate through the chaos to discern whether we could find any existing structure that we could put the weight of ourselves and our resources behind… and that if we drove it towards its logical end… could solve the growing grand challenges we were perceiving around the world, and secure the kind of future we all desired. 

We could not identify any existing institution, organization, political party, or nation state that would work…

So we began working towards designing and building one that would. 

The closer we got, the fiercer the opposition was, and after surviving that, we are here. 

That is approximately how I got here, and why we are in dialogue. After bringing together lifetimes of work, we are sitting on the edge of beginning to activate the only total, comprehensive logic, system, and program of action that I am aware of that *might work*, and I cannot see any other way. 

While nearly everything has been stripped away through the refining fires, I hope and pray that what remains is useful. 

If I and anything we have built to date is useful to the network, we are yours. We are here to serve. 

My battles with corruption made it clear to me that anyone standing up to the existing system is likely to have their life destroyed. My education in the existing systems led me to understand that if we don’t transform them, we will never succeed, and if they collapse before we have co-created a successor, society will descend into chaos. 

It is therefore with great humility that we are offering ourselves up entirely in service to the network, to the global community of goodwill, to all generations of life, and to the Source of life. 

After wrestling with the question of what our relationship is to the structures of corruption that plague us and society, we have come to understand that the only moral option available to us is to do what must be done to transform them so that future generations will not suffer as we have, and as so many around the world have suffered far worse.

The only action that we can see might work is to awaken and unite a global community / federation / army of goodwill to meet this moment in history. In that process we are willing to lift the heaviest burdens we can bear and take the greatest risks upon ourselves, to stand up to the strongest powers on earth, and bring them under the authority of God and the free people of this beautiful world. 

If anyone thinks this is fun, or we consider ourselves qualified for whatever is asked of us… quite the contrary. The road to date has been hard and marked by fire, embarrassment, and loss, yet we cannot in good conscience ask any other family to take on these risks, knowing the dangers that lie ahead. 

Yet we can see a glimmer that eternally reminds us that in partnership with God we can bear up under any stress and load, and that all things are possible. So we are advancing, not for our own benefit, but to attempt to inspire people in every time, place, and domain on earth to stand up together and do the same, right where they are. 

If billions of us stand together in partnership with life and its Source, what could possibly stand against us? The miracles that are needed will occur. 

We are all entirely unqualified to lead the fullness of what is trying to emerge. However I have faith and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that together, in partnership with God and one another, we are all collectively qualified and indeed chosen specifically for this unique moment in history. 

If we can succeed in this quest, we can realize a future that is better for all. And indeed we can succeed, if we can learn together how to allow what is trying to emerge to joyfully flow through us. All creation is longing for it. 

The Spirit that impels us to love is calling us to arise and embark, to love our neighbors as ourselves, to regenerate this precious planet and living system that sustains us all, and to begin to individually and collectively embody the eternal values that we all cling to. It is something like that. 

With Love, In Community,
