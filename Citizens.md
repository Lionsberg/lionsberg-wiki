# Citizens

[Citizens]] refers to the members of a political community, such as a city, nation or state, who enjoy certain [[Rights and Responsibilities]] within that community. Citizenship typically implies a status conferred by a structure of governance, granting individuals the right to participate in the civic process, access social services, and enjoy other benefits. It also implies a responsibility to abide by the laws and norms of the community, contribute to its well-being, and engage in civic activities that help the community flourish. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is based on a [[Citizen Led]] response to the [[Meta Crisis]], enabled and empowered by a Citizen Led Lionsberg. Citizens play a crucial role in driving transformative change at all levels of the plan, from individual and local to collective and  global.

In the context of the Lionsberg System, "Citizens" represent a higher level of commitment and responsibility than [[Members]] and [[Participants]]. Citizens have entered into a covenant relationship with the community, signifying their dedication to the shared Vision, Goals, and Values, and their willingness to work together for the common good.

Citizenship in the Lionsberg System involves taking on a more significant role in the community's decision-making, stewardship, and governance. Citizens are expected to actively contribute their skills, knowledge, and expertise to help advance the collective progress towards the shared Vision. They also commit to adhering to the agreed-upon Values, Principles, and Processes that guide the community's actions and decisions.

As Citizens, individuals gain access to additional rights, resources, and support within the system. They are also entrusted with greater levels of responsibility and influence in decision-making processes, as well as increased opportunities for learning and growth.

Citizens are expected to uphold their covenant relationship with the community, demonstrating their commitment to the shared Vision and their ability to effectively contribute to the community's progress. They are also encouraged to continuously improve their own practices and processes in alignment with the shared Vision and Goals, as well as supporting others in their journey towards more meaningful participation, responsibility, and stewardship.

Ultimately, Citizens in the Lionsberg System form a core group of committed individuals who play a crucial role in driving the collective progress towards the New World envisioned in the [[New Vision and Plan]]. They serve as role models for others in the community and work together to create a thriving, resilient, and just society that embodies the principles of stewardship, cooperation, and shared prosperity.

Individuals typically become eligible for Citizenship in Lionsberg after 2 to 3 years as committed and contributing [[Members]].
