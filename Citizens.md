# Citizens

[Citizens]] refers to the members of a political community, such as a city, nation or state, who enjoy certain [[Rights and Responsibilities]] within that community. Citizenship typically implies a legal status conferred by a structure of governance, granting individuals the right to participate in the civic process, access social services, and enjoy other benefits. It also implies a responsibility to abide by the laws and norms of the community, contribute to its well-being, and engage in civic activities that help the community flourish. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is based on a [[Citizen Led]] response to the [[Meta Crisis]], enabled and empowered by a Citizen Led Lionsberg. Citizens play a crucial role in driving transformative change at all levels of the plan, from individual and local to collective and  global. Some of the ways in which citizens can contribute to addressing the Meta Crisis and promoting a more loving, just, and regenerative world include:

1.  **Awareness and Education**: Becoming informed about the complex challenges that humanity and the [[Living System]] are facing, and acquiring the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to engage in effective [[Citizen Led]] action.
    
2.  **Personal Responsibility**: Taking responsibility for one's own actions, choices, and behaviors, and striving to harmonize ones own [[Way of Being]] to the well-being of the community and the [[Living System]].
    
3.  **Civic Participation**: Engaging in the civic process by voting, running for office, attending public meetings, or joining advocacy campaigns to influence policies and decision-making related to the [[Meta Crisis]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]].
    
4.  **Community Action**: Collaborating with others in one's local community to address shared challenges, foster resilience, and support regenerative and just development.
    
5.  **Consumption Decisions**: Supporting businesses and products that prioritize social and environmental responsibility, and advocating for more regenerative and ethical consumption patterns.
    
6.  **Global Solidarity**: Recognizing the interconnected nature of the world's challenges and embracing a sense of shared responsibility and solidarity with people and the planet, transcending local, national, cultural, and other divides.
    

By actively engaging in these and other activities, citizens can make a significant impact in addressing the [[Meta Crisis]], realizing the [[New Vision and Plan]], and shaping a better future for all.
