# Advantage Based Decision Making

Advantage based decision making is a process used to isolate advantages and select superior alternatives.  The process is recorded for future reference so that a record is developed supporting important decisions.  

The documentation of not only what the decision was made, but **WHY**… including what the [[Next Best Alternatives]] were and why they were rejected... is critical to the knowledge, learning, and continuity between generations in the IPD Teams and Global Community.

The best known advantage based decision making system is _Choosing by Advantages_ (“CBA”), a system that assumes that choices are made based only on the importance of advantages, rather than a calculation of the differences between advantages and disadvantages.  CBA recognizes that no decisions are truly objective.  Its goal is to establish and record the considerations that lead to important decisions.  Graphic records of CBA sessions are maintained as part of the Project Record.
