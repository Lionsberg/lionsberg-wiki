# A Story, System, Structure, Community, Platform, Project, Game, Way

The Lionsberg idea was not merely a structure, a project, a community, a system, a myth, or a game. 

It was a total solution purpose-built to accomplish the total idea, and bring an entirely [[New World]] and [[New]] [[Way of Being]] into [[Reality]] for the [[Good]] of [[All]].  

This demanded the creation of a single conceptual entity that included a story, a system, a structure, a community, a project, and a way of being, that if acted out comprehensively, might work.
