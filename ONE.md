# ONE

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[ONE]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point to the same [[Ultimate Reality]] that we point to with English Word Tools such as [[God]], [[Source]], [[Absolute]], [[Creator]], etc. 

It non-religiously, non-dogmatically, and non-idolatrously refers to the One [[Ultimate Reality]] from, through, and to which [[All]] other things arise and return. 

Rather than adopt any existing religion or concretization of the [[Absolute]], the [[LIONSBERG System]] intentionally leaves this in the [[Abstract]] so that it stays transcendent of all human ideology and idolatry, and so that people from many different perspectives and systems of belief can relate to it and wrestle with it for eternity. 

By putting our Selves in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]], we are compelled to align our [[Aim]] with the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] of which we can presently conceive. 

WARNING: Do not attempt to [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]] or the System will fail! In religious terms, reducing [[Ultimate Reality]] to a human-made set of "orthodox" religious or ideological forms or propositions is akin to [[Idolatry]]. 

In the [[Old World]] humanity devolved and was deceived into division and warfare over whose idea of "god" was **The One**. Further, advanced non-human intelligences (Elohim, Annunaki, Nommo, etc.) masqueraded as "gods" and sought dominion over various tribes and domains. 

In the [[New World]], We are aware that we [[All]] flow from [[ONE]] eternal and universal [[Source and Sustainer]], and reject all Authority but [[ONE]]. 

By placing our Selves in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]], we place our Selves in service of the [[One Thing]] that unites us All, and we [[Help One Another]] progress towards Unity and Coherence through Love.
