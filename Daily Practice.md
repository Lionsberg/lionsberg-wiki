# Daily Practice
Any System, Philosophy, or Program of Action is [[Operationalize|Operationalized]] [[Today]]. 

Anything that we ever do, we do [[Today]]. 

If you have not taken the time to really think through a [[Daily Practice]] that operationalizes the Wisdom, Principles, and Values that you hold, while [[Aligning Energy|Aligning Your Energy]] with the Teams, Organizations, Communities, and Federations you engage in, we would highly recommend that you adopt something like the Daily Practice outlined in [[The Power of Today]] as a starting point. 

The Power of Today is a Guide to a day well-lived written by Jordan Nicholas Sukut. It was purpose-built to integrate with the rest of the [[Lionsberg System]].
