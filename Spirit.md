# Spirit

"Spirit" can be understood as the essence or fundamental nature that drives and guides a system or entity's behavior, interactions, and purpose.

Everything has a "Spirit" to it. 

Ultimately, at the [[Highest Level of Abstraction]], Spirit refers to the [[Spirit of God]], the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of the Universe / All Creation.
