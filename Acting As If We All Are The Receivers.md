# Acting As If We All Are The Receivers

All the conditions existed that would demand the appointment of a [[Receiver]] to sort out the issues of the [[Old World]] for the benefit of [[All]], and yet no institution existed that could determine or appoint such a role. 

All the Institutions of the [[Old World]] were broken, impotent, and inept. Corrupt power structures possessed veto rights. 

However, we, the 8 billion people on earth, could effectively organize ourselves and [[Act As If]] we were the receivers of the [[Old World]], and were appointed and responsible for elevating and transforming it, for the good of [[All]], into the [[New]]. 

This would require us to forge a new [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among us, to establish the means by which we would collectively govern / navigate our Selves towards [[The Goal]].   

We determined that unless and until we discovered someone "out there" with the authority, qualifications, and mandate to act in this manner, we would [[Act As If]] it were our responsibility, 8 billion of us collectively, to assume this role on a temporary basis until such a time as a [[New Order]] could be established. 

Therefore, everything we collectively tasked to the [[Receiver]], we were tasking to our [[Selves]], and we would need to organize our [[Selves]] in order to accomplish it. 

This framework obligated us legally and morally to [[Act As If]] we were the Receivers of everything that came before to this moment of history, and the Stewards of everything that would be handed to subsequent generations.
