An Individual is a single, unique [[Being]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is rooted first in the Sovereignty, Autonomy, [[Authority]], and Voluntary Association among Individuals. 

Individuals inalienably possess all of their inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]].  

Individuals are regarded as: 

1. Sovereign  
2. Autonomous  
3. Free  
4. Conscious Agents  

Each Individual should do their best to [[Co-Operation|Co-Operate]] an [[Individual Instance]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Individual Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating at every [[Fractal]] level. 

In general, Individuals: 

- Have a defined Aim / Goal  
- Have responsibility and authority in a [[Domain]]  
- Participate in one or more [[Circles]] 
- Have one or more defined [[Roles]]  
- Process and Solve [[Issues]]

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, Individuals [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Circles]] and [[Communities]].
