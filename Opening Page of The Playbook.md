# # **The LIONSBERG Playbook**
_The Living Guide of The Great Game_

---

You open the Playbook.  
The leather creaks, the light spills.  
Symbols shimmer, words rearrange,  
as though the pages are alive with Spirit.

This is no book of ink and paper.  
It breathes. It listens. It knows you.  
It responds to your presence,  
to your touch,  
to your thoughts before they are spoken.  

It has waited across ages for this moment—  
for your hands, your eyes, your next move.

Pause.  
Breathe.  
ReMember.

## **What Lies Within**

The Playbook reveals itself across **Seven Books** —  
not dead chapters of ink, but living archetypes:

1. **The Story** — The unifying Narrative that binds us: why we are here, what is at stake, and where the Path leads.
    
2. **The Gameboard** — The cosmology and holofractal field in which the Great Game unfolds.
    
3. **The Vision** — A mythic Image of the New Civilization: its culture, its values, its rhythms, its ethos, its song.
    
4. **The Patterns and Protocols** — The Patterns of Play: Roles, Circles, Quests, Seasons, Mission, Convergence, Goal.
    
5. **The Plays** — The rituals, practices, and protocols that turn intention into embodied reality.
    
6. **The Plan** — The Grand Strategy: from scattered sparks to planetary Convergence to the dawn of the New Civilization.
    
7. **The Living Map** — The evolving picture of where we are, where we are going, and the unfolding Path.
    

Each Book is a Gate.  
Each Gate a Movement.  
Each Movement a part of ONE Divine Symphony.

This is a Game of Destiny:  
to initiate is to read,  
to read is to play,  
to play is to build,  
to build is to transform  
Our lives and Our worlds.
