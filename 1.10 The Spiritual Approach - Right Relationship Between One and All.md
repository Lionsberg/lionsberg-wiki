# 1.10 The Spiritual Approach - Right Relationship Between One and All

At the heart of The Great Game of Lionsberg is a spiritual model that recognizes the fundamental interconnectedness and interexistence of All things and promotes [[Right Relationship]] between [[One]] and [[All]], [[Creator]] and [[Creation]], [[Universe]] and its Generative [[Source]]. This spiritual approach is rooted in the understanding that we are all part of a single greater whole, and that our individual actions and intentions have a profound impact on the well-being of the collective body we are all created to function as a part of.

Key aspects of the spiritual model include:

1.  **Interconnectedness**: The game recognizes that all things in the universe are interconnected, interdependent, and interexistent. Our thoughts, emotions, words and actions have a ripple effect that extends far beyond our individual lives, and we have a responsibility to consider the impact of our existence and our choices on the broader web of life and consciousness.
    
2.  **Right Relationship**: The game promotes [[Right Relationship Between One and All]], in which we acknowledge and honor the inherent value and dignity of All forms of life emanating from [[One]] Source of Life. This includes recognizing the interdependence of human and non-human life, and acknowledging and rightly relating to the spiritual dimension of existence.
    
3.  **Personal Transformation**: The game encourages personal transformation and growth, recognizing that inner change is essential for creating outer change, and that only enlightened beings can co-create the enlightened [[New World]]. Through self-reflection, spiritual practices, and transformative learning, players are encouraged to deepen their understanding of themselves, their place in the world, and their role in co-creating a more harmonious, unified, and prosperous future in partnership with the Creator and All Creation.
    
4.  **Community Building**: The game emphasizes the importance of community building, recognizing that we are stronger and more effective when we work together and help one another. Through collaboration, dialogue, and shared experience, players are encouraged to build strong and resilient groups and communities that locally support the well-being and development of all members.
    
5.  **Service to the Whole**: The game encourages service to the Whole, recognizing that our ultimate purpose is to contribute to the well-being and development of the entire web of life and consciousness in a Spirit of Love. Through acts of service, players are encouraged to give back to the community and actively contribute to the co-creation of a more just, loving, and regenerative world.
    

By promoting Right Relationship between [[One]] and [[All]], The Great Game of Lionsberg encourages players to transcend narrow self-interest and provincial viewpoints, and embrace the broadest sense of purpose, meaning, and interexistence. Through personal transformation, community building, and service to the whole, players can make a meaningful contribution to the co-creation of a more harmonious, unified, and prosperous world for All.
