# New World

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[New World]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the [[Best Possible Future]] we are moving towards. 

The New World is used in contrast to the [[Old World]], which points towards the corrupt, broken, dysfunctional, and unjust elements of the past we are leaving behind. 

This sets up a collective Quest: 
FROM the [[Old]], TO the [[New]]. 

See also [[New Vision and Plan]].
