# Value Stream Mapping

Value Stream Mapping is an important tool that analyzes processes step by step.  The “current” state of the process is mapped graphically.  Then the participants in that process eliminate those steps that do not add [[Value]] to the process (e.g. redundant reviews, additional paper copies, waiting for multiple approvals).  [[Value Stream Mapping]] not only streamlines processes but also offers tangible benefits in reducing the space and resources required to house and operate a [[Process]]. 

Value steam mapping is critical since the entire System is designed to measure and incentivize the creation of [[Value]], and eliminate [[Waste]].
