# Trust

Trust, both organizational and individual, is required for Integrated Delivery.  Trust must be a common thread running through the entire program and will provide the foundation for [[Collaboration]].  Trust is essentially a decision each person on the project makes every day to trust the other participants. 

Trust requires that we count on the inner sense of responsibility, integrity, and capability, having faith that others will choose to act in a trustworthy manner, while simultaneously recognizing the possibility that they may choose to betray the faith trust we have placed in them. 

Since each participant is asked to focus on project goals and continuous [[Flow of Work]] through the entire Program, each must be empowered by their organization to interweave the short term goals of the organization with the long term goals of both the project and the overarching Program. 

Trust is realized through fulfilling commitments.  Commitments form the basis of communication between team members.  Team members must request clear and realistic commitments, strive to keep their own commitments, and timely notify team members if a commitment cannot be met.  **_An Integrated Delivery System becomes_** **_a network of commitments that depends upon all participants keeping their commitments (i.e., being trustworthy and reliable)_**. Because policing of individual activities wastes time and effort, team members must rely upon others to honor commitments or to immediately notify the team when confidence is lost in the ability to deliver as promised.
