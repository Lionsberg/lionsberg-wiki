# FAQ - How Dare You?!

"How dare we? The Lionsberg System is not about one person or group claiming authority or permission, it is about recognizing the inherent power and potential in all people and communities to come together and collectively address the grand challenges we face. The problems and issues we face as a society are too big for any one person or group to solve alone. It's time for all of us to take responsibility and take action. We believe in the power of collective intelligence and collective action, and we believe that by coming together and working towards a common goal, we can create a better future for all. 

The Lionsberg System is one of service to all who wish to voluntarily engage and be empowered by it. It exists purely in service to One and All.
