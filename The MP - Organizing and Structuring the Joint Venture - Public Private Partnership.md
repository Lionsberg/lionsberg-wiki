# The MP - Organizing and Structuring the Joint Venture - Public Private Partnership

It was determined that the [[Meta Project]] to solve the [[Grand Challenges]], accomplish the [[Global Goals]], and land humanity on a safe trajectory towards its [[Best Possible Future]] should be structured as a [[Citizen Led]] Joint Venture. 

The Joint Venture would take the form of a [[Citizen Led Public Private Partnership]], which would be capable of drawing on public, philanthropic, and investment resources to accomplish its goals and objectives. 

After evaluating various options, it was discovered that the [[The Myth Of Lionsberg]] had anticipated such a need, and gone to great lengths to forge a [[Provisional Structure]] as a [[Starting Point]]. Being immediately available the purpose-built for the [[Meta Project]], it was adopted. 

This allowed the Citizens to move immediately towards resourcing the [[Critical Path]].
