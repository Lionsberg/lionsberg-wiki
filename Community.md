# Community
Community relates to the sense of fellowship and [[Being]] together, often as a result of shared place, practice, interests, or goals. 

The value of community represents the importance of connections and relationships with others. It involves being a part of a larger whole, and working together towards shared goals and values.

One basic #epiphany is that in order to design and build a better word, we must inspire a global community of goodwill to design and build itself so that we can find one another, help one another, and pragmatically work together to gather and apply energy and resources.
