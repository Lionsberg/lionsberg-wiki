# Creator

"Creator" refers to the [[Source]] or [[Uncaused Cause]] of the universe; the Highest Power and Supreme Being. In various philosophical and religious traditions, the Creator is seen as the Ultimate Source of [[All]] that exists, responsible for bringing the universe into being and sustaining it. Creator is often associated with concepts like [[God]], the Divine, the [[Absolute]], and [[Ultimate Reality]], and is often considered to be the Source of all [[Wisdom]], [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Goodness]], and [[Beauty]].

In the context of the Lionsberg System, the Creator is understood as the Ultimate Reality or Supreme Being that transcends and gives rise to the manifest universe, and serves as the source of all wisdom, truth, love, goodness, and beauty. The Creator is considered to be the highest Ideal, the Ultimate Goal, and the Ultimate Source of inspiration and guidance. The Lionsberg System recognizes that the Creator is the ultimate source of all that is good, wise, true, and beautiful, and encourages its members to seek, know, serve, and rightly relate to the Creator and All Creation in all aspects of their lives.  

For agnostics, the concept of the Creator can be considered as the highest brute fact, the fundamental generative principle that must exist outside of any system of thought. Regardless of one's personal beliefs about the existence or nature of That Which is Creating and Sustaining the Universe, the Lionsberg System recognizes that the pursuit of wisdom, truth, love, goodness, and beauty requires an alignment with a transcendent higher Standard and Source of inspiration, and invites humanity to explore and engage with the concept of the Creator and Creation in a way that is most meaningful and fulfilling to them.
