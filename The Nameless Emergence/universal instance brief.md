# universal instance brief
*planetary-scale coordination without geographic constraint*

---

## purpose

The Universal Instance ensures that **no one is involuntarily left behind** regardless of geographic location.

This is the coordination layer for distributed relationships - people who resonate with the nameless emergence but cannot or will not participate in a local prototype.

## the strategic importance

**Not everyone can relocate to North Idaho.**

Many people in J's trust network live across the globe. Others may be in locations where local prototype formation isn't yet viable. Still others may prefer virtual coordination while maintaining their current life situation.

**The Universal Instance enables participation for all.**

It also serves as the **testing ground for planetary-scale virtual coordination** - proving that circles can form, quests can be undertaken, and transformation can happen without geographic proximity.

## how it works

### Virtual Circles
**Structure:** 3-8 people meeting weekly via video

**Formation paths:**
- **Geographic affinity:** People in same region but too dispersed for face-to-face
- **Functional affinity:** People working on same guild function (healing, governance, etc.)
- **Relational affinity:** Existing relationships from J's network
- **Random assignment:** New arrivals matched with circles needing members

**What they do:**
- Weekly video gatherings (90 minutes)
- Seasonal quests undertaken individually or collaboratively
- Mutual support and accountability
- Documentation of virtual circle protocols
- Invitation of others in their networks

### Virtual Guilds
**Examples:**
- **Technology Guild:** Building coordination tools, platforms, AI assistance
- **Documentation Guild:** Capturing and organizing all learnings
- **Media Guild:** Podcasts, videos, stories, outreach
- **Training Guild:** Onboarding, facilitation, replication support
- **Strategy Guild:** Coordination across instances, milestone tracking

**What they do:**
- Coordinate specific functions across all circles
- Support local prototypes with expertise
- Create templates and tools for replication
- Feed learnings to LIONSBERG prototype

### Coordinating Council
**Who:** Rotating representatives from virtual circles and guilds

**Frequency:** Monthly video meetings

**What it coordinates:**
- Progress toward Cycle 40 (268M participants)
- Support for sister instances
- Resource flows and commons governance
- Integration with local prototypes
- Planetary campaigns and initiatives

## connection to the nameless emergence

The Universal Instance is **one of three levels** of the nameless emergence:

**Circle Level:** Martial arts and other practice circles (some virtual, some face-to-face)

**Local Level:** North Idaho prototype + emerging sister local prototypes globally

**Universal Level:** This instance coordinating planetary network

**How they integrate:**
- **Local prototypes feed learnings** to Universal Instance
- **Universal Instance provides resources** to local prototypes
- **All feed to LIONSBERG prototype** for benefit of future instances
- **Coordination when needed** for planetary campaigns or crisis response

## what we're learning

**Critical questions we're answering:**
- Can virtual circles build genuine transformation and trust?
- What protocols make video gatherings effective?
- How do you integrate new participants at exponential scale?
- Can commons be governed virtually?
- What role does AI play in coordination at this scale?
- How do virtual and local instances coordinate?
- What's the balance between synchronous and asynchronous work?

**What we're documenting:**
- Virtual circle protocols that work
- Async coordination approaches
- Onboarding and integration pathways at scale
- Digital commons governance
- AI assistance integration (if applicable)
- Inter-instance coordination protocols

## challenges we expect

**And how we'll address them:**

1. **Zoom fatigue** → Async components, varied formats, optional gatherings
2. **Time zone complexity** → Regional clusters, recorded content, flexible scheduling
3. **Lack of face-to-face** → Periodic in-person gatherings where feasible, strong circle bonds
4. **Trust building virtually** → Longer integration period, video required, accountability structures
5. **Information overload** → Clear channels, good documentation, AI assistance
6. **Infiltration at scale** → Application vetting, invitor responsibility, graceful exits
7. **Coordination complexity** → Better tools, distributed leadership, guild specialization

## the bigger vision

**The Universal Instance is not separate from local work - it's the connective tissue.**

People start virtually, then:
- Some stay virtual permanently (and that's valid)
- Some form local prototypes in their regions
- Some relocate to existing local prototypes
- All stay connected through Universal Instance

**The result:**
- Planetary network of millions in virtual circles
- Thousands of local prototypes (each their own 300)
- All coordinating through Universal Instance
- All learning from each other via LIONSBERG prototype

**This enables:**
- **Rapid spread** through existing networks (no geographic constraint)
- **Local rootedness** through prototypes proving pattern works
- **Planetary coordination** when needed for major initiatives
- **Resilience** through distributed structure (no single point of failure)

**This is not about replacing face-to-face community.**

**This is about ensuring that distance doesn't prevent participation, that existing networks can coordinate, and that planetary-scale transformation can happen through both virtual and local channels working together.**

**If you resonate but can't relocate, the Universal Instance is your entry point.**

**If you want to start local work in your region, the Universal Instance is your training ground and ongoing support.**

**Either way, we're building this together.**

**That's the work.**
