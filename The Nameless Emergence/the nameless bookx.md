## A Context of Crisis

While the precise details remain intentionally obscured, it is becoming evident to **Us All** that **something is wrong**.   

The **old systems** are failing at an accelerating rate.  
The **old institutions** have lost our faith and trust.  
The **old power structures** rage and war.  
**Tens of millions of excess deaths** have touched our communities.  
New pathologies spread, and **chaos and tyranny** spiral by design.   

As the Old Systems collapse under the weight of their own corruption and the puppeters behind the madness are unveiled, it is becoming increasingly clear that ***the existing order cannot and should not be saved***. 

This realization ushers in **a time of crisis and opportunity** unlike any in the last ten thousand years.    

Now faced with **the greatest fraud, deception, and existential threat** in millennia, how will humanity respond?  

Will it fragment into dystopia? Will it be herded down the chutes of kontrolle?  
Or will it arise and unite to build a **New Civilization** and co-create **Heaven On Earth**?  

Billions of lives and all we hold dear now immediately depend upon whether we can work together to successfully design, build, and embody a **New Civilization** *before the **Old** collapses by design*. 

But how? 

## Designing and Building a New Civilization

There is no one way to awaken a species, liberate a world, or design and build a new civilization.   

It is as much art as architecture; as much play as project, as much story as system.  

In the end it is unique to every time, every place, and every one. It is about participation in Spirit and Truth with the Divine life that is trying to emerge in and through **Us All**. It is about a Way for ordinary people to consciously practice and play a **New Civilization** into existence — before the old systems collapse. 

There is a unstoppable, nameless, and universal movement towards flourishing and abundant life, now awakening the souls of Earth and beckoning **All** to remember **Who We Are** as members of **ONE Body**. The Spirit of the **[[ONE]]** moves through every cell and particle of Creation. After millennia of exploitation, Earth herself has already decided to shift, and is inviting all her inhabitants to align or exit. No one owns this universal movement. Like the **ONE** it All originates from, it is ultimately ineffable, inevitable, transcendent, and inclusive of all names and movements. 

Yet there are times when Spirit is not enough; 
when shared intention must actually take form;  
when vision must actually be brought into reality;  
when worlds must actually be regenerated and restored;  
when the cosmic clock demands courageous and concerted action. 

These times require not only Spirit, but also skill;  
not only courage, but also competence;  
not only community, but also coordination; 
not only willingness, but also work;  
not only archetypes, but also incarnation.  

The **New Civilization** we are **playing into being** must *actually work*.  
It must actually be designed, built, and embodied _before the Old collapses_.  
From there it must be cooperated, maintained, and passed on to the rising generations.  

It is not enough to "do good" and hope it all magically works out in the end. Millions of uncoordinated and misaligned good instruments do not a Divine Symphony make. 

The imagination, design, and building of a New Civilization must be undertaken with no less skillful precision than is common to any major human endeavor. 

***And this is the most significant project in millennia.*** 

LIONSBERG is a free open source system, process, and protocol **purpose built to enable this**. There is no central organization to join. There is no one to pay. There is no one to complain to, criticize, or tell you what to do. 

It is simply a **Golden Seed** containing a set of patterns and a Way of being, designing, and building that makes any world that embodies it more like Heaven. It is **a Pattern Language of Heaven**.  

If it resonates and is useful, it is yours to nurture, improve, and pass on. 
If not, simply continue on your path.  
It will be here waiting when you are ready.

While its true history stretches out into the stars and back into time immemorial, the **[[LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto]]** shares a broad overview of LIONSBERG's incarnation and adaptation to English and Earth through the life and work of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a planetary+ network of allies. 

**[[Jordan's Short Story]]** is a relational bridge for those who knew him or are curious about his life, work, and death.   

This **Nameless Book** is our ongoing attempt to simplify and reduce the ~3 million words **[[J's Death]]** left behind into an immediately understandable and actionable form for those of us who would like to continue to build upon this invaluable and irreplicable **starting point**. From here everything is built to emerge, evolve, and transform. 

## How To Begin 

Like an ancient bridge spanning a seemingly impossible chasm, **LIONSBERG** offers a Way to transcend the inevitable collapse of the Old and immediately embark on the **shared journey** towards **Heaven On Earth and Beyond**.    

However the journey cannot be compelled. Each individual and locality must make **the choice**, play **the game**, and walk **the sacred path** towards **The Goal**.    

So how can one best begin?  

There is a well known saying among masters of the Way: 

> **_To know the Way, One must live it_**

If you attempt to grasp LIONSBERG intellectually before beginning, it is nearly certain that you will fail or turn away. Words tossed into a mind kontrolled matrix such as Earth are notoriously problematic. The only Way to know and understand its power and potential is to step into **the story**, play **the game**, and allow **the Spirit**, **the patterns**, and **the plays** to unfold through you. If it does not transform you, you can stop playing at any time.  

The entire system is built around the concept of **Circles** — small self-governing, self-sustaining, self-replicating "cells" of 3 to 12 individuals working together to transform their lives and their worlds as parts of a broader **emergent superorganism**. Sovereign individuals in self-governing small groups are the core units of the **New Civilization**. 

Eventually **Circles** must align into **Communities** and **Guilds**, and **Bioregions** into properly ordered **Worlds** — requiring shared **rhythms**, **patterns**, **protocols**, and **plays** — but that is a few steps down the **Path**. 

For now, the crucial first step is to begin.  

> **_Every Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step_**

To begin, simply **invite** a few people you resonate with to a gathering and **read aloud** the following five pages. A 90 minute gathering will allow for about 30 minutes of reading, and 60 minutes of dialogue and sensemaking to discern next steps.  

1. **[[the nameless bookx]]** (opening page - you are here) ~ 7 Min 
2. **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]** ~ 3 Min   
3. **[[Prologue to The Story and The Great Game]]** ~ 3 Min   
4. **[[The Story of LIONSBERG]]** ~ 10 Min  
5. **[[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]** ~ 7 Min   

From there, **[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]** provides guidance on how to co-operate as a highly effective Circle, while eventually aligning into Circles of Circles. 

**[[Frequently Asked Questions]]** addresses many of the most common questions and concerns. 

**[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]]** is a thirty minute read that provides important and shocking information on what Jordan's extraordinary journey revealed, where he left off, and irreplaceable puzzle pieces those playing The Game can build upon. **PLEASE READ IT. IT CONTAINS LIFESAVING INFORMATION**. 

**[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]** is a series that tracks what is emerging following **[[J's Death]]**. 

For those desiring greater community, connection, and guidance, beginning January 2026 I will be personally hosting an invitation-only instance of The Game. You are welcome to join it on the basis of mutual consent, or start your own sovereign instance. Having access to Jordan's neural network and additional asymmetric information, I can likely cut a few hundred hours off the learning curve for anyone who so desires. The minimum **commitment** to join is **the first tenth** of your time. 

We all may feel "too busy" to save the world. But with billions of lives and centuries to come hanging in the balance, **WE ALL HAVE THE FIRST TENTH OF OUR TIME AVAILABLE TO PLAY**. 

That is all for now. As the first **Circles** choose **Quests** and get into **Play**, additional information will be added as it is needed and requested, and The Nameless Book will continue to write itself. 

Please **Pass The Flame** by sharing this link with your loved ones and allies as they awaken to the difficult realities at hand, and are ready to get into action. 

_Perhaps at long last, **The Great Game** will finally be played again_.
