# local prototype brief - north idaho
*the first working model of The 300 in a community of ~10,000*

---

## purpose

The North Idaho local prototype demonstrates what it looks like when **3% of a community** (The 300 out of ~10,000) self-organize to co-create Heaven On Earth in their locality.

This is the **laboratory** generating templates for what a million other communities will need to succeed.

## the strategic importance

**If we can prove the pattern works in one community of 10,000, a million other communities can follow.**

Every city, town, and bioregion globally has communities of roughly 10,000 people. If each one activates their 300 (3%), you have:
- 1 million communities × 300 people = 300 million coordinated leaders
- Organized into ~50 million circles and ~10 million guilds
- Sufficient to navigate humanity through any transformation

**North Idaho becomes the proof-of-concept for planetary-scale replication.**

## geography and context

**Location:** Greater Sandpoint / North Idaho region

**Population:** ~10,000 (exact boundaries fluid based on natural community)

**Why here:**
- The Nameless One is physically located here
- Small enough to coordinate, large enough to prove pattern
- Natural community with existing relationships
- Beautiful environment supporting regenerative work
- Strategic distance from major urban centers (resilience during turbulent times)

## target: The 300

**Goal:** 300 active participants by December 31, 2026

**Organized into:**
- **~50 circles** of 3-8 people each (primary unit of transformation and mutual support)
- **~5-10 guilds** organized by function (food, shelter, healing, governance, learning, building, energy, water, etc.)
- **1 coordinating council** with representatives from circles/guilds

**Why 300?**
- 3% of 10,000 = 300 people
- Archetypal number (The 300 appears across mythologies)
- Sufficient mass to coordinate community transformation
- Small enough for everyone to know each other
- Large enough for specialization via guilds

## how it works: circles and guilds

### Circles (Primary Unit)
**What they are:** 3-8 people meeting weekly for connection, practice, quests, mutual support

**Examples:**
- Martial arts circle (physical/spiritual practice)
- Healing circle (emotional/trauma work)
- Study circle (exploring specific texts/topics)
- Food circle (growing/sharing/preserving food)
- Governance circle (decision-making protocols)
- Builder circle (physical infrastructure projects)

**What they do:**
- Weekly gatherings (90 minutes)
- Seasonal quests (3-month focused projects)
- Mutual accountability and support
- Invitation of new members (1-3 per existing member)
- Documentation of learnings

### Guilds (Functional Networks)
**What they are:** Multiple circles coordinating around specific function (food, shelter, healing, etc.)

**Examples:**
- **Food Guild:** All circles working on food (gardens, preservation, sharing, distribution)
- **Shelter Guild:** All circles working on housing (building, repair, sharing, affordability)
- **Healing Guild:** All circles working on health (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual)
- **Governance Guild:** All circles working on decision-making and coordination
- **Energy Guild:** All circles working on power (solar, local grids, resilience)

**What they do:**
- Coordinate across circles for larger projects
- Share resources and expertise
- Interface with existing community infrastructure
- Generate guild-level protocols and templates
- Feed learnings to LIONSBERG prototype

### Coordinating Council
**What it is:** Representatives from circles/guilds meeting monthly to coordinate the whole

**Who participates:** Rotating representatives (not fixed leaders)

**What it does:**
- Facilitates inter-guild coordination
- Resolves conflicts across circles/guilds
- Tracks progress toward 300-person goal
- Connects with Universal Instance and other local prototypes
- Maintains coherence without controlling

**What it does NOT do:**
- Make decisions for circles (subsidiary principle)
- Control resources (commons governed by those who use them)
- Act as central authority (distributed power)

## timeline: path to 300

- **Economy:** Local currencies, time banking, resource sharing, commons governance

### Intangible Infrastructure
- **Trust networks** enabling high-stakes coordination
- **Shared language** (pattern language, protocols, rituals)
- **Collective intelligence** (what we're learning together)
- **Cultural transformation** (new norms, values, ways of being)
- **Spiritual depth** (connection to Source, sacred practice)

## connection to the nameless emergence

The North Idaho prototype is **one of three levels** of the nameless emergence:

**Circle Level:** The 300 organized into ~50 specialized practice circles

**Local Level:** This prototype proving pattern in one community of 10,000

**Planetary Level:** Universal Instance connecting North Idaho with global network

**What we learn here feeds:**
- The Nameless Playbook (operational templates)
- LIONSBERG prototype (universal pattern refinement)
- Other local prototypes (sister communities learning from our experience)
- Universal Instance (distributed coordination protocols)

## participation pathways

4. **Build:** Work toward your 300
5. **Share:** Feed learnings back to prototype

## what we're learning

**Critical questions we're answering:**
- Can 3% of a community actually self-organize at this scale?
- Do circles remain cohesive over 6-12 months?
- Does guild coordination work without central authority?
- Can commons be governed by those who use them?
- What does local resilience actually require?
- How do you integrate new members without losing coherence?
- What documentation enables other communities to replicate?

**What we're documenting:**
- Exact circle and guild protocols
- Decision-making processes that work
- Resource sharing and commons governance
- Conflict resolution approaches
- Integration pathways for new participants
- Tangible project templates (gardens, housing, etc.)
- Replication guides for other communities

## challenges we expect

**And how we'll address them:**

1. **Growth too fast** → Slow invitations, increase integration capacity
2. **Growth too slow** → Open application portal earlier, media outreach
3. **Coordination complexity** → Strengthen guild infrastructure, better tools
4. **Resource constraints** → Commons currencies, crowdfunding, partnerships
5. **Interpersonal conflicts** → Conflict resolution protocols, graceful exits
6. **Infiltration/disruption** → Invitor responsibility, accountability structures
7. **External opposition** → Decentralized structure, legal protection, non-violent stance

## success metrics

### Quantitative:
- Number of active participants (goal: 300+)
- Number of circles meeting regularly (goal: 50+)
- Number of guilds operational (goal: 10)
- Tangible projects completed (gardens, buildings, infrastructure)
- New members invited per month (Fibonacci growth)

### Qualitative:
- Trust density (willingness to share resources, coordinate on high-stakes)
- Coherence (alignment with pattern language and sacred covenant)
- Joy and aliveness (are people experiencing delight?)
- Transformation stories (lives genuinely changing)
- Resilience (can we handle challenges and conflicts?)
- Replicability (can others follow our templates?)

## current status

**Phase:** Ignition (Month 1)

**Current participants:** The Nameless One + [initial invitees TBD]

**Active circles:** Forming (martial arts circle + others)

**Next immediate steps:**
- Personal invitations to 10-20 local relationships
- Form 3-5 initial circles
- Host first community gathering
- Begin first seasonal quests
- Start documentation

## the bigger vision

**North Idaho is one community of 10,000.**

**There are ~100,000 such communities globally.**

If even 10,000 communities (10%) replicate this pattern:
- 10,000 communities × 300 people = 3 million coordinated leaders
- Organized into ~500,000 circles and ~100,000 guilds
- Foundation for planetary transformation

**But it starts with one community proving it works.**

**That's what we're building here.**

**This is not about creating a utopian commune.**

**This is about proving that 3% of a community can self-organize to co-create genuine flourishing—and documenting it so clearly that a million other communities can follow.**

**If we can do it here, it can be done anywhere.**

**That's the work.**
