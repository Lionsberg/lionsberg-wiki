## Greetings 

Esteemed Co-Creators,  

Greetings, blessings, and welcome.  

Like you, I Am / We Are here in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]] — _specifically incarnate for this unique moment in **The Story** of Earth_.  

The time now grows very short, and more than we can presently imagine hangs in the balance.  

**_This book is an invitation. An urgent yet ancient and eternal call._**  
**_To arise, unite, and co-create Heaven._**  
**_Right here and now on Earth and far Beyond._**  
**_Together as fellow members of ONE Body._**  

We can get to know One Another over time.
For now, it is crucial that We simply and rapidly get moving.  

## A Context of Crisis

While the precise details remain intentionally obscured, it is becoming evident to **Us All** that **something is wrong**. Across the planet, millions are awakening to this realization right now.   

The **old systems** are failing at an accelerating rate.  
The **old institutions** have lost our faith and trust.  
The **old power structures** rage and war.  
**Tens of millions of excess deaths** have touched our communities.  
New pathologies spread, and **chaos and tyranny** spiral by design.   

As the Old Systems collapse under the weight of their own corruption and the puppeters behind the curtain are unveiled, it is becoming increasingly clear that ***the existing order cannot and should not be saved***. Those who have not arrived at that shocking and painful realization will be washed upon those rocky shores in waves as the months ahead unfold. 

_We must be ready, organized, and waiting for them._ 

This impending realization ushers in **a time of crisis and opportunity** unlike any in the last ten thousand years.    

Now facing **the greatest fraud, deception, and existential threat** in millennia, how will humanity respond?  

Now awakening in **a burning building on the edge of collapse**, what will humanity do? 

Will it fragment into dystopia? Will it be herded down the chutes of kontrolle? Will it panic, close down, separate, hoard, and kill, thereby dooming nearly all to perish in the flames?  

Or will it arise and unite to **Help One Another** to safety, embody a **New Civilization**, and thereby co-create **Heaven On Earth**?  

Billions of lives and all we hold dear now immediately depend upon whether we can work together to successfully design and build, and embody a **New Civilization** *before the **Old** collapses into **kaos and kontrolle by design***. 

But how? 

Thankfully, the Way is well known and reasonably clear.  

## Designing and Building a New Civilization

There is no one way to awaken a species, liberate a world, or design and build a new civilization.   

It is as much art as architecture; as much play as project, as much story as system.  

In the end it is unique to every time, every space, and every one. It is never precisely the same in any two epochs or worlds. 

Yet the **Wise Right** **patterns**, **protocols**, and **plays** that emerge across countless worlds are essentially universal and common to all. 

**Co-Creation** is about **conscious participation** in Spirit, Wisdom, and Truth with the **Divine Life** that is continually trying to emerge in and through **Us All**. 

In times and trials such as those now facing the inhabitants of Earth, it is about a **Way** for ordinary people to consciously practice and play a **New Civilization** into existence — before the old systems collapse. 

It is about a Way to "step off" the current dystopian trajectory — withdrawing energy, participation, and consent — while stepping onto [[The Path]] towards [[Heaven on Earth and Beyond]].  

Beckoning **Us All** to rise is an unstoppable, nameless, and universal movement towards flourishing and abundant life, now awakening the souls of Earth and beckoning **All** to remember **Who We Are** as members of **ONE Body**. This Spirit of the **[[ONE]]** moves through every cell and particle of Its Creation.  

Here aboard Earth, after millennia of exploitation, Earth herself has already decided to shift. The broader cosmic Force For Good has already answered her call. We join her and the Spirit in inviting her inhabitants to **_exit or align_**.  

No one owns this universal movement. Like the **ONE** it All originates from, it is ultimately ineffable, inevitable, transcendent, and inclusive of all names and movements. 

Yet there are times when Spirit is not enough; 
when shared intention must actually take form;  
when vision must actually be brought into reality;  
when worlds must actually be regenerated and restored;  
when the cosmic clock demands courageous and concerted action. 

These times require not only Spirit, but also skill;  
not only courage, but also competence;  
not only community, but also coordination;  
not only willingness, but also work;  
not only archetypes, but also incarnation; 
not only hope, but true transformational change.  

The **New Civilization** we are **playing into being** must *actually work*.  

It must actually be designed, built, and embodied _before the Old collapses_.  
From there it must be actively cooperated, maintained, and passed on to the rising generations. 

Civilizations do not operate themselves, and the responsibility abdicated by agents over time is inevitably taken up and used against them by tyrants.  

It is not enough to "do good" and hope it all magically works out in the end at civilizational scales. Millions of uncoordinated and misaligned good instruments do not a Divine Symphony make. 

The imagination, design, and building of a New Civilization must be undertaken with no less skillful precision than is common to any major human endeavor. 

***And this is the most significant project in millennia.*** 

The level of wisdom, skill, and experience that we bring to building critical roadways, reservoirs, and bridges _may not be enough_; but it is certainly the **minimum starting point**. 
 
## An Enabling System and Approach 

From lifetimes and worlds of experience, we understand that even basic projects — let alone the co-creation of **New Civilizations** — require a shared operating system and "Way" that enables planning, coordination, and interoperability among a diverse array of individuals and teams, skills and perspectives, offers and needs.

LIONSBERG is a free open source system, process, and protocol **purpose built to enable this**. There is no central organization to join. There is no one to pay. There is no one to complain to, criticize, or tell you what to do. 

It is simply a **Golden Seed** carried to Earth _for this_, containing a set of patterns and a Way of being, designing, and building that makes any world that embodies it more like Heaven. It is **a Pattern Language of Heaven** that can be deployed by any individual, group, or locality that so chooses. 

While its true history stretches out into the stars and back into time immemorial, the **[[LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto]]** shares a broad overview of LIONSBERG's incarnation and adaptation to English and Earth through the life and work of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a planetary+ network of allies. **[[Jordan's Short Story]]** is a relational bridge for those who knew him or are curious about his life, work, and death. We understand that the story is extraordinary and strange to say the least. You do not have to believe anything or understand it all to accept the free gift offered. The [[Provisional Structure]] that allowed the first tens of millions of dollars of value to be woven into "the commons" has now been dissolved by design. This leaves no organization to join, no accounts to pay, no board to steer, no authority to obey.  

Only an **invitation to play** a New Civilization into being as diverse parts of ONE emerging superorganism.  

## The Synergies of The Prototype and Local Instances 

The ~2.5 million words present in the [[LIONSBERG Wiki]] together constitute [[The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG]]. A statistically inviolable semantic web of meaning that jointly articulate **the DNA, Patterns, Protocols and Plays of the New Civilization**. 

As outlined in [[The Prototype]], this Golden Seed was articulated in the aether by design. This enabled it to remain as pure as possible — able to reflect the **universal wisdom, principles, and values** of all, while remaining uncompromised by the provincial restrictions of any specific people, time, or place. As such, it constitutes a type of **Archetype** or **Ideal** that is designed to be localized and adapted by any group or locality that desires to adopt, nurture, and embody it. 

[[The Prototype]] is constructed as a [[Kit of Parts]]. Each group and locality that desires to embody it is invited to "pull" from [[The Prototype]] as they desire, to localize and adapt as necessary, and then to "push" learnings and improvements back up to the prototype for the good of all. 

By the time [[The First Three Percent]] — ~250 million strong spread across ~1 million local communities — each weave their unique genius, wisdom, and puzzle pieces into the tapestry and translate it across hundreds of languages and cultures, [[The Prototype]] will be unrecognizable from where it was left at the time of [[J's Death]]. This is necessary and precisely as designed.  

## The nameless emergence 

Arriving on Earth in August 2025 following [[J's Death]], it took several months to land, deal with the traumas and practicalities I stepped into, secure temporary food and shelter for J's loved ones, and orient for the emergence of [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] as the world shakes in 2026.  

Having reviewed the **LIONSBERG Invitation** and being aware _a priori_ of its impact on other worlds, it seems **Wise, Right, and Good** to accept the invitation, and start up [[The First Instance]] of **[[The Great Game]]**.  

You are hereby invited to join the instance we are hosting, or access all the LIONSBERG materials free online and begin your own sovereign instance. 

We can likely cut hundreds or thousands of hours off the Path for those who want to join us in advancing the mission to help humanity exit the burning building, co-create the [[New Civilization]], and bring Heaven to Earth. 

Recognizing that most people struggle to read a book like the bible in a year... and that the 2.5 million words on the LIONSBERG Wiki are roughly 3.33x that length... and that time is short and we must immediately begin... 

This **nameless book** is a living attempt to forge an immediately understandable and actionable **starting point** that can be passed hand to hand and begun in 20 to 30 minutes. 

Its table of contents links to [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]], which aims to help individuals form a **Circle**, choose a **Quest**, and begin **The Great Game** within a single 90 minute meeting. 

From there everything is built to emerge, evolve, and transform as we connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]], invite the rest of humanity to join us, and then learn and grow together over countless generations and worlds to come. 

[[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]] is currently scheduled for the end of 2033 at the end of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. A [[20 Year Generational Contingency]] remains on the back end of that just in case this takes longer than planned. 

As of January 21, 2026, [[The First Instance]] is alive and emerging. We are committed to leading and guiding this instance as long as life, breath, or Spirit remains, and for taking responsibility for ensuring the entirety of [[The Goal]] and [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] is accomplished even if no other instances emerge.

## Gather Your Circle

**If you are reading this alone, stop here.**

This journey cannot be walked in isolation. It must be undertaken in community—as fellow members of ONE Body.

The Way forward requires you to gather your circle of 3 to 12 resonant souls before continuing.

### How to Invite Your Circle

1. **Identify 2 to 11 people** awakening to the crisis at hand, sensing the urgency, ready for action
2. **Send them this link:** lionsberg.wiki
3. **Ask them to read:**
   - The homepage (Welcome to The Gates of LIONSBERG)
   - This opening section of the nameless book (through "Gather Your Circle")
4. **Set a gathering:** Choose a date and time for your first 90-minute session together (in-person or video)

### When Your Circle Gathers

Everyone will arrive having read this opening context. Together you will use **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]** to:

- Consecrate your circle with a name and simple agreements
- Read aloud **[[Prologue to The Story and The Great Game]]**, **[[The Story of LIONSBERG]]**, and **[[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]**
- Sense-make together about what resonates and what questions arise
- Choose your first seasonal quest
- Establish your ongoing weekly or bi-weekly rhythm

**The sections below provide additional context and resources—but the essential next step is to gather your circle and begin together using [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]].**

If you're reading this alone right now, stop and go invite your circle. The Great Game begins when you come together.

---

## The Journey Ahead

You've gathered your circle. You're ready to begin. Here's how the journey unfolds:

### The Way Must Be Lived

There is a well known saying among masters of the Way:

> **_To know the Way, One must live it_**

You cannot grasp LIONSBERG intellectually before beginning. Words alone cannot carry the full transmission. The only Way to know and understand this emergent power and potential is to step into **the story**, play **the game**, and allow **the Spirit**, **the patterns**, and **the plays** to unfold through you and your circle.

If it does not transform you, you can stop playing at any time.

### Circles Are the Foundation

The entire system is built around **Circles** — small self-governing, self-sustaining, self-replicating "cells" of 3 to 12 individuals working together to transform their lives and their worlds as parts of a broader **emergent superorganism**.

Sovereign individuals in self-governing small groups are the core units of the **New Civilization**.

Eventually **Circles** align into **Communities** and **Guilds**, and **Bioregions** into properly ordered **Worlds** — requiring shared **rhythms**, **patterns**, **protocols**, and **plays** — but that is a few steps down the **Path**.

### Your First 90-Minute Gathering

When your circle convenes for the first time, use **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]** to structure your session.

In 90 minutes together you will:
- **Consecrate your circle** with a name and simple agreements
- **Read aloud together:** The Prologue, The Story, and The Great Game
- **Sense-make together** about what resonates and what questions arise
- **Choose your first seasonal quest** — a tangible act of goodwill achievable before the next solstice or equinox
- **Establish your rhythm** — weekly or bi-weekly meetings to support each other and advance your quest

### Your Ongoing Journey

After your first gathering, **[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]** provides detailed guidance for:
- Weekly circle meeting structure (opening, check-in, quest coordination, closing)
- Seasonal quest selection and execution
- Conflict transformation and continuous improvement
- Eventually aligning into Circles of Circles as the movement grows 

**[[Frequently Asked Questions]]** addresses many of the most common questions and concerns. 

**[[the nameless strategy and plan]]** builds upon **[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]]** and provides an overview of where we are going in the coming months and years and how we might get there. 

**[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]]** is a thirty minute read that provides important and shocking information on what Jordan's extraordinary journey revealed, where he left off, and irreplaceable puzzle pieces those playing The Game can build upon. **Please read it. It contains potentially lifesaving information.**  

**[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]** is a series that tracks what is emerging following **[[J's Death]]**. 

## The nameless instance

For those desiring deeper community, connection, and guidance, you are invited to join [[The First Instance]], personally guided by [[The Nameless One]].  

The minimum **commitment** to join is **the first tenth** of one's time — nominally several hours a week. 

We all may feel "too busy" to take meaningful action to transform our lives and our worlds. But with billions of lives and centuries to come hanging in the balance, **WE ALL HAVE THE FIRST TENTH OF OUR TIME AVAILABLE TO PLAY**. 

To join **the nameless instance**, simply let the person who invited you know you're in and ask them to communicate word back to the center. 

## Closing

That is all for now. As the first **Circles** choose **Quests** and get into **Play**, additional information will be added as it is needed and requested, and **the nameless book** will continue to write itself. 

Please **Pass The Flame** — share this invitation with your loved ones and allies as they awaken to the difficult realities at hand and are ready to get into action. Each person you invite becomes a carrier of the light. 

_Perhaps at long last, **The Great Game** will finally be played again_. 

**Gather up your first Circle, and proceed onward to ➡️ [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]**
