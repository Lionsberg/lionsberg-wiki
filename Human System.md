# Human System

The total set of all Human Beings and Human activity, conceptualized as a [[System]]. 

The Human System is nested within the higher order [[Living System]], or Natural System. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed to reintegrate the total [[Human System]] within the [[Living System]] that contains it, in the conceptual context of the single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta System]].
