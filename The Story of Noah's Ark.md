# The Story of Noah's Ark

## Introduction:

The story of Noah's Ark is one of the most well-known and enduring stories in the Old Testament. It tells the story of Noah, a righteous man, who is chosen by God to build an ark and save his family and the animals from a great flood.

## Story Narrative:

God saw that the earth was corrupt and filled with violence, and he was sorry that he had made it. So God decided to cleanse the earth of its wickedness with a great flood.

God chose Noah, a righteous man, to build an ark and save his family and each type of animal from the flood. God commanded Noah to gather two of every kind of animal, male and female, and to bring them into the ark.

And Noah did as God commanded, and he gathered the animals and his family into the ark. And when the rains came, the ark floated on the waters, carrying Noah and all the animals safely through the storm.

After the rains stopped and the waters receded, the ark landed on the top of a mountain. And when Noah and his family emerged, they saw that the earth was clean and new, and they gave thanks to God.
