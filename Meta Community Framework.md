# Meta Community Framework

Beyond _doing_, it was recognized that such a program of action would require an entirely [[New]] [[Way of Being]] together. 

If we were to succeed in the [[Meta Project]], a [[Meta Community]] or [[Meta Federation]] would be required as a prerequisite.

If we got the [[Community]] and relationships right, everything else would be possible. 

If we failed to get the [[Community]] right, there was no chance of success. 

The new [[Community]] / [[Federation]] would need to be [[Sovereign]], in the same way and according to the same principles as each of its participants was [[Sovereign]]. 

And so a conceptual [[Ideal]] was established: A sovereign community of sovereign beings, working together in functional unity and right relationship to [[One]], [[One Another]] and [[All]], to [[Progress]] towards our shared [[Universal Goals and Values]]. 

Through great debate and consultation with leading thinkers on how to articulate and mobilize collective action among such a [[Federation]] of [[Sovereigns]], it was determined that a [[Framework]], a [[System]] and a [[Structure]] would be required. 

We would need to inspire a global community to design and build itself, so that together we could design and build the [[New World]].
