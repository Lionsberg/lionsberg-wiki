# Commitment Based UBI

Commitment Based UBI, short for Commitment Based Universal Basic Income, is the basis of the [[Lionsberg Currency]].  

It measures relative commitment levels on a 1 to 7 to the [[Lionsberg Goals]]. 

It also linguistically and technically relates to the [[Network of Commitments]] that produces [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]].  

The key to UBI is ensuring that as a Community we are Progressing towards our Goals and Objectives. 

Is someone is "contributing a lot", but not actually advancing the objectives, it is [[Waste]] and they should at a minimum stop creating Waste, and at best start helping the Community progress towards its Goals and Objectives. 

[[Level Of Commitment]] is a qualitative and human negotiation between each individual and the Community.
