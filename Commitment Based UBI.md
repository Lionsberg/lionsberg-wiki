# Commitment Based UBI

Commitment Based UBI, short for Commitment Based Universal Basic Income, is the basis of the [[Lionsberg Currency]].  

It measures relative commitment on a scale of 1 to 7. 

It also linguistically and technically relates to the [[Network of Commitments]] that produces [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]].  

The key to UBI is ensuring that as a Community we are Progressing towards our Goals and Objectives. 

If someone is "contributing a lot", but not actually advancing the objectives, it is actually [[Waste]] that hinders the ability of the [[Lionsberg System]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

[[Level Of Commitment]] is a qualitative and human negotiation between each individual and the Groups they participate in.
