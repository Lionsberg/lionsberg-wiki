# The Charge Of The Receiver

We charged ourselves, as acting [[Receiver]], with the following mandate: 

_The Receiver will do the [[Wise Right Thing]], at the right time, for the right reasons, to accomplish the [[Meta Goal]] for the [[Good]] of [[All]]._   

Critically, it was made clear that the Receiver was not to be any one individual, but the entire [[Meta Community]] / [[Meta Federation]], who would need to organize itself to act in this manner. 

This meant that _[[All]] were bound to do the wise right thing, at the right, for the right reasons, to accomplish [[The Goal]]._

The [[Receiver]] was eventually given and [[Authority]] to organize and hold accountable the existing institutions and authorities on earth. 

This was accomplished simply by uniting the [[Free Will]] of billions of people, who chose for it to be so, and who exercised their [[Attention]], [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]] as if that were the case. 

The Charge of the Receiver contained within itself the mandate to: 

_1. Solve the total set of [[Grand Challenges]]_  
_2. Accomplish the total set of [[Global Goals]]_  
_3. Forge the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]_  

This demanded the elevation and transformation of [[All]] [[Systems]] and [[All]] [[Domain|Domains]] of [[Worksite Earth]], without exception.
