# Forging or Joining a Group

Forging or joining a group can be a powerful way to engage in the [[Citizen Led Response]] to the [[Meta Crisis]] and contribute to co-creating a more just, regenerative, and thriving future for all. Here are some steps to consider:

1.  **Define your purpose and vision**: Identify the reasons why you want to forge or join a group, and clarify your personal vision and values. What issues or challenges are you most passionate about, and what kind of change do you want to create? This will help you find or start a group that aligns with your purpose and provides meaningful opportunities for engagement and growth. 
    
2.  **Research existing groups**: Look for groups or organizations that are working on the issues you care about. This can include local, national, or international organizations, as well as grassroots movements and online communities. Research their mission, values, and activities, and identify groups that resonate with your personal vision and goals. If you can't find what you are looking for, start it. Others are likely looking for the same thing. 
    
3.  **Attend events and meetings**: Once you have identified potential groups, attend their events and meetings to learn more about their work and connect with other members. This can include public events, community meetings, or online gatherings. Engage in conversation, ask questions, and share your own experiences and perspectives. If you are considering starting a group, invite potential members to attend meetings or events that allow them to explore their alignment and potential. 
    
4.  **Contribute your skills and resources**: Once you have forged or joined a group, look for opportunities to contribute your skills, talents, and resources. This can include volunteering for specific tasks, sharing your expertise, or donating funds or materials. Be open to learning from others and collaborating on projects.
    
5.  **Build relationships and connections**: Forge meaningful relationships with other members of the group, and seek to connect with individuals who share your values and vision. This can help build a sense of community and support, and can also provide opportunities for networking and collaboration beyond the group.
    
6.  **Stay engaged and committed**: Remain committed to your personal vision and the group's purpose, and stay engaged in its activities and initiatives. Be open to feedback and constructive criticism, and be willing to adjust your approach or perspective as needed. Stay connected with other members, attend meetings and events, and continue to contribute your time, skills, and resources to the group's mission.
    
7. **Understand the [[New Vision and Plan]]**: Read and discuss the materials as a group, and explore how you can meaningfully engage within your own group, as well as connecting and federating with other groups to tackle every larger challenges. 

By forging or joining a group, you can contribute to the larger effort of the [[Citizen Led Response]] and work towards co-creating a Just and Regenerative future for All.
