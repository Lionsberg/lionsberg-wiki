# 2.15 Leveraging The Commons to Begin

As you begin your individual, circle, and local journeys, reach out, connect with any other Players of The Game that you can find, and see what tools and resources may already be present in The Commons as you begin your Quests. 

If you can't find anyone to connect with, build your own Commons for your first Circle, grow that Circle, then split and replicate as you approach 12 to 16 individuals. Soon, you will have a shared Commons serving those two groups that can be continuously improved over time as your local instance of The Great Game expands.
