# Why

The [[LIONSBERG System]] operates on a [[Narrative Framework]] married up to Systems of Integrated Delivery and Self Governance. 

[[Who We Are Going With]] corresponds to Step 1 in the System - Vision / Intention / Goal.  

It precedes vision / intention / goal by ensuring those are aligned at the deepest level with [[Purpose]]. 

It invokes the [[Lionsberg System Of Spirituality, Purpose And Meaning]].
