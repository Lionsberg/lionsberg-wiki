# Emergence

Emergence describes the phenomenon where the collective behaviors of a system's components lead to outcomes that are greater than the sum of individual actions. It's a foundational concept for understanding complex systems within the Lionsberg framework.

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[Emergence]] is a [[Word Tool]] we use to point at creative process through which [[New]] things come into [[Being]] / [[Reality]]. 

We sometimes use phrases like [[That Which Is Trying to Emerge]] to acknowledge the spirit and [[Conscious Agency]] involved in Emergence. 

Emergence occurs in us and through us through a process of [[Progressive Realization]] and [[Progressive Articulation]].  

As [[Conscious Agents]] [[Co-Creating]] our [[Reality]], we are active participants in Which One, out of the total set of all [[Potential Futures]], actually [[Manifest|Manifests]] itself.  

Our [[Aim]] is to [[Co-Create]] the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] that enables the [[Best Possible Future]] to [[Emerge]] through us [[All]] as a result of our [[Way of Being]].
