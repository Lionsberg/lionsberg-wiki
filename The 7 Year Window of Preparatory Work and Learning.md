# The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning

The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning refers to the period from 2017 to 2023, when many people around the world were called to shift the focus of their activities towards preparation. 

This is also when [[Jordan]] began gathering allies from tribes and nations around the world, discerning together the [[Critical Path]] and [[Pattern Language]] of the [[New Vision and Plan]], and co-creating the [[Provisional Structure]] and backbone of infrastructure and technology required for [[The Body]] to begin assembling itself in Spring 2024 as [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] opened. 

During this period, core elements of the infrastructure, technology, and pattern language were tested and reviewed among hundreds of individuals and groups across dozens of tribes and nations.
