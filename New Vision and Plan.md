# New Vision and Plan - A Pathway to a Thriving, Regenerative Future

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is a holistic framework that presents a bold and captivating vision for a just, regenerative, and flourishing future for [[All]]. This roadmap addresses the r[[Root Causes]] of our global challenges and offers practical guidance on catalyzing transformative change at the individual, organizational, community, national, and systemic levels. 

To explore aspects of the New Vision and Plan in more detail, see: 
- [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]  
- [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]]  

## Context 

As we navigate the complexity of the interrelated spiritual, cultural, values, political, economic, ecological, and geopolitical crises confronting humanity, we recognize that we face an unprecedented threat. This collective understanding is deeper than the specific words articulated in [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], bringing us together to address these challenges.

## Vision

Beyond the precise language in [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], people of goodwill share a united vision of a world that embodies abundance, balance, and right relationships among all. In this [[New World]], every individual, community, and ecosystem can realize their full potential and thrive in harmony. We call this highest aspiration the [[Designer's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]], or simply [[The Goal]]. 

## Analysis

We acknowledge that the existing systems and structures of the [[Old World]] are inadequate, corrupt, and both unwilling and unable to effectively address the [[Meta Crisis]]. As such, we require a [[Citizen Led]] [[Meta Solution]] to transform our world and co-create a brighter future for [[All]].

## Engagement

Understanding that every citizen and living being on Earth has a stake in the transformation FROM the [[Old World]] TO the [[New World]], we recognize that the [[Success]] or [[Failure]] of the [[Meta Project]] will impact every individual, community, and ecosystem on this planet, including future generations.

## Values 

United by a shared set of [[Universal Values]] aligned with [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], and [[Wisdom]], we commit to a voluntary, bottom-up, evolutionary solution that prioritizes individual and local dignity, responsibility, sovereignty, and autonomy, over top-down authoritarian or revolutionary approaches that will only lead to further failure and suffering. 

## Strategy 

Our strategy is to forthrightly launch a historic, [[Citizen Led]] effort to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] in all its dimensions, while simultaneously co-creating the [[New World]].

This requires breaking down the [[Meta Crisis]] into a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] that can be identified, analyzed, and overcome, as well as deconstructing the [[New Vision and Plan]] into a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] that can be progressively realized.

The strategy then calls for a transformative global movement to awaken and unite humanity, elevate consciousness, and empower citizens towards coordinated individual and local action that advances humanity towards its shared goals and values. Our hypothesis is that Story serves as the most potent vehicle to achieve this progressive awakening and reunification. 

The strategy calls for establishing an agile [[Core Enterprise]] [[Co-Operating]] an instance of the [[Lionsberg System]] to connect, serve, and empower the decentralized [[Federation]] of rising [[Citizen Impact Groups]]. This will serve as a prototype of a transparent, accountable, and effective [[New Operating System]] for the [[New World]].

With this Vision and Strategy in mind, we outline the following 15 primary strategy points:

1.  **Continuously improve a comprehensive and inspiring Meta Story**: Craft and continuously improve a compelling, inclusive, and inspiring story that communicates our shared vision and goals, resonating with diverse audiences worldwide and enabling them to align their [[Individual and Local Stories]] with the [[Meta Story]]..
    
2.  **Inspire and mobilize stakeholders**: Ignite a sense of shared purpose, collective responsibility, and unstoppable momentum among individuals, organizations, and communities by uniting them through a compelling vision, values, and goals.
    
3.  **Cultivate dynamic partnerships**: Forge alliances and collaborations across sectors, disciplines, and borders to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices, accelerating our collective impact.  
    
4.  **Identify, connect and empower local action**: Identify, connect, and empower grassroots initiatives and projects that address specific aspects of the Meta Crisis, fostering resilience and driving systemic change from the ground up. Rapidly cross-pollinate wisdom, knowledge, and solutions of what is working and lessons learned across different localities around the world.  
    
5.  **Cultivate a culture of lifelong learning and development**: Establish a global mentorship and learning network to facilitate skill development, knowledge sharing, and capacity building among citizens and teams. Craft and disseminate transformative educational resources that enlighten people about the root causes of global challenges and reveal the life-affirming potential of the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 
    
6.  **Develop and amplify transformative narratives**: Leverage multimedia content and storytelling to raise awareness, inspire action, and showcase success stories that reflect our shared vision and values.
    
7.  **Innovate and scale solutions**: Identify, pilot, and champion groundbreaking, adaptable, and scalable solutions that can be applied across diverse contexts, effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges of the [[Meta Crisis]] and accelerating  progress towards the New World.
    
8.  **Harness technology and creativity**: Tap into the power of technology, innovation, and imagination to develop and implement tools, platforms, and approaches that drive profound systemic change..
    
9. **Champion diversity and justice**: Ensure diverse representation and participation in decision-making, prioritizing marginalized voices, nature, and others who are often unheard.
    
10.  **Implement distributed and adaptive governance**: Employ agile and responsive governance structures of self-governance that promote collaboration, learning, and adaptation to navigate the complex challenges of the Meta Crisis. 
    
11.  **Transform incentivizes towards regenerative practices**: Co-create policy changes, market mechanisms, and cultural shifts that reward regenerative practices, encouraging and empowering individuals, organizations, and societies to prioritize the well-being of people and the planet across multiple generations. 
    
12.  **Catalyze systemic change**: Influence policy and decision-making at all levels of analysis, transforming laws, regulations, and institutions to support the transition to the New World.
    
13.  **Celebrate milestones and progress**: Recognize and share achievements, breakthroughs, and success stories that demonstrate the impact and progress of our collective efforts.
    
14. **Monitor progress and adapt**: Continuously assess the effectiveness of our initiatives, learn from our successes and failures, and adapt our strategies and tactics as needed to fulfill our vision..
    
15. **Persevere and never give up**: Recognizing that challenges, obstacles, and setbacks are inevitable, act with courage and persistence and never give up, no matter how hopeless or dark things may temporarily appear. 
    

By pursuing these strategic objectives, we can mobilize a global movement that overcomes the Meta Crisis, fosters unity, and propels humanity towards a just, regenerative, and flourishing future for all. Through the collective efforts of engaged and concerned [[Citizens]] worldwide, we will actualize our shared [[Vision]] and transform our world for the better.

## Plan 

Based on this [[Context]], [[Vision]], [[Analysis]], [[Engagement]], and [[Strategy]], we are continuously improving a detailed and comprehensive [[Plan of Action]] as part of the [[New Vision and Plan]].
