# New Vision and Plan - A Pathway to a Thriving, Regenerative Future

_(2023.04.26 Draft For Review and Improvement)_

Like all aspects of [[Lionsberg]], the New Vision and Plan is a [[Work In Progress]].

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is a holistic framework that presents a bold and captivating vision for a just, regenerative, and flourishing future for [[All]]. This roadmap addresses the [[Root Causes]] of our global challenges and offers practical guidance on catalyzing transformative change at the individual, organizational, community, national, and systemic levels. 

To explore aspects of the New Vision and Plan in more detail, see: 

- [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]] and the other [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]].

## Summary 

## Context 

As we navigate the complexity of the interrelated spiritual, cultural, values, political, economic, ecological, and geopolitical crises confronting humanity, we recognize that we face an unprecedented threat. This collective understanding is deeper than the specific words articulated in [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], bringing us together to address these challenges.

## Vision

Beyond the precise language in [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], people of goodwill share a united vision of a world that embodies flourishing, balance, and right relationships among all. In this [[New World]], every individual, community, and ecosystem has the opportunity to realize their full potential and thrive in harmony. We often refer to this highest aspiration the [[Designer's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]], [[Heaven On Earth]], or simply [[The Goal]]. 

## Analysis

We acknowledge that the existing systems and structures of the [[Old World]] are inadequate, corrupt, and both unwilling and unable to effectively address the [[Meta Crisis]]. As such, we require a [[Citizen Led]] solution to transform our world and co-create a brighter future for [[All]].

## Engagement

Understanding that every citizen and living being on Earth has a stake in the transformation FROM the [[Old World]] TO the [[New World]], we recognize that the [[Success]] or [[Failure]] of the [[Meta Project]] will impact every individual, community, and ecosystem on this planet, including future generations.

## Values 

United by a shared set of [[Universal Values]] aligned with [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], and [[Wisdom]], we commit to a voluntary, bottom-up, evolutionary solution that prioritizes individual and local dignity, responsibility, sovereignty, and autonomy, over top-down authoritarian or revolutionary approaches that will only lead to further failure and suffering. 

## Strategy 

Our strategy is to forthrightly launch a historic, [[Citizen Led]] effort to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] in all its dimensions, while simultaneously co-creating the [[New World]].

Conceptualizing the scope of this approach requires breaking down the [[Meta Crisis]] into a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] that can be identified, analyzed, and overcome, as well as deconstructing the [[New Vision and Plan]] into a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] that can be progressively realized.

The strategy then calls for a **transformative global movement** to awaken and unite humanity, elevate consciousness, and empower citizens towards coordinated individual and local action that advances humanity towards its shared goals and values. 

Our hypothesis is that Inspiration and Story serve as the most potent tip of the spear to achieve this progressive awakening and reunification. 

Citizens who awaken and respond to the Story will be invited to 1) share their own unique story, and 2) **connect to the Lionsberg System, Platform, and Community.**  

The role of the Lionsberg System, Platform, and Community is to continuously transform and improve itself in service of All Citizens. This means continuously improving the resources, benefits, infrastructure, tools, services, and technologies available to Citizens. 

Recognizing our fundamental need for belonging and our ability to be and do more together than we can insolation, Citizens will be invited to forge or join [[Groups]], which constitute the core of community life and progress. 

The Lionsberg Platform has been purpose-built to empower Individuals to organize into groups, for groups and individuals to engage in time bound, measurable, and resouceable [[Projects]]. 

To serve and empower this emergent decentralized [[Federation]] of [[Citizen Impact Groups]], the strategy calls for establishing an agile [[Core Enterprise]] whose role is to connect, serve, and empower All citizens, groups, and institutions. 

This will serve as a prototype of a transparent, accountable, and effective [[New Operating System]] of the [[New World]]. If properly adopted and continuously improved, it has the potential to *become* the operating system of the New World, empowering all to help one another progress wisely towards The Goal. 

## 15 Key Strategy Points

With this Vision and Strategy in mind, we outline the following 15 key strategy points:

1.  **Continuously improve a comprehensive and inspiring Meta Story**: Craft and continuously improve a compelling, inclusive, and inspiring story that communicates our shared vision and goals, resonating with diverse audiences worldwide and enabling them to align their [[Individual and Local Stories]] with the [[Meta Story]]..

## Plan 

Based on this [[Context]], [[Vision]], [[Analysis]], [[Engagement]], and [[Strategy]], we are continuously improving a detailed and comprehensive [[Plan of Action]] as part of the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

## System Wide Master Plan 

At the highest level, the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] operates in service of [[The Goal]] based on a [[System Wide Master Plan]]. 

The System Wide Master Plan encompasses the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], and is unified by the [[Meta Goal]]. The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is further broken down into a [[Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]]. 

The [[Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]] is organized around three high-level phases of the [[New Vision and Plan]]:

1.  Program Initiation and Implementation
2.  Overcoming the [[Meta Crisis]] and co-creating the [[New World]]
3.  Passing the Baton to Future Generations

Each of these phases is broken down into key [[Features of Work]], each of which is being developed into their own further breakdowns.

### Phase I: Initiation, Implementation, and Administration

1.  **Establishment of the Core Enterprise**: Set up the legal, financial, administrative, and process foundations for the [[Core Enterprise]] that will serve as the communications and mission control hub for the global movement.
    
2.  **Recruitment and Onboarding**: Identify and engage key stakeholders, thought leaders, experts, and passionate individuals from diverse sectors to form the initial Core Team, Wisdom Council, and Impact Partnerships.
    
3.  **Communication and Collaboration Infrastructure**: Design, develop, and implement effective communication and collaboration tools to facilitate efficient coordination, knowledge sharing, and decision-making among participants.

By continuing to implement and improve this plan, we can mobilize a global movement that overcomes the Meta Crisis, fosters diverse unity, and propels humanity towards a just, regenerative, and flourishing future for all.

## High Level CPM Planning 

At the highest level, planning is accomplished by transforming the [[Strategy]] into a high level [[Critical Path]] schedule.  

This guides the overall understanding of the relative importance, timing, and sequencing of each component of the [[Program of Action]]. 

## Quarterly 12 Week Plans 

The high level CPM is used to inform the development of more detailed 12 week plans of action, which are distributed across the array of groups to inform and align the Federation of key goals, milestones, and objectives. 

## 6 Week Look-Aheads 

The quarterly plans inform rolling 6 week look-ahead schedules, which document what happened last week, what is planned for the current week, and provide a rough glimpse of the coming 4 weeks. 

## 2 Week Plans 

Teams then execute and pulse on the basis of rapidly adapting 2 week plans, that lead towards the accomplishment of the quarterly objectives, which advance the [[Critical Path]] of the [[System Wide Master Plan]], which leads towards [[The Goal]]. 

For current status and plans in more detail, see [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan of Action]].
