# Synergy

_The interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. This concept is often used in business, science, and other fields to describe how collaborative efforts can lead to enhanced outcomes that wouldnâ€™t be possible individually._ (Open Civics)
