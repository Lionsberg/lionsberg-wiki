# Rights

"Rights" are a set of principles, norms, or benefits that either inalienably belong to, or are granted to individuals or groups, either by human law, spiritual law, or moral consensus, as essential to their dignity, equality, and freedom. Rights serve as a foundation for the establishment of just and fair societies, ensuring that individuals and groups have the opportunity to live and thrive without undue interference or oppression.

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], rights play a crucial role in fostering a diverse, just, and [[Citizen Led]] society. The protection and promotion of rights serve as a basis for the community's commitment to upholding the values of [[Right Relationship]], [[Diversity]], and [[Dignity]].
