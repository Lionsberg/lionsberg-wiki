# Goals

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], "Goals" are the broader, long-term outcomes that we aim to achieve as we work together towards the [[New World]]. While [[Objectives]] are specific, measurable, and time-bound targets, Goals represent the higher-level aspirations and desired states that guide our collective efforts and inspire our actions. Goals are integrated by the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], and unified by the [[Meta Goal]]. 

Goals in the Lionsberg System help Co-Creators to:

1.  Maintain a clear and inspiring vision of the desired future we are working towards.
2.  Set priorities and guide decision-making at both the individual and collective levels.
3.  Stay motivated and committed to the long-term mission, even in the face of setbacks and challenges.
4.  Foster a sense of shared purpose and unity among diverse individuals and groups.
5.  Continuously refine and adjust our strategies and approaches in response to changing circumstances and emerging opportunities.

By establishing and pursuing ambitious and challenging Goals, Co-Creators are able to maintain a strong sense of direction, purpose, and growth on our journey to [[Cross The Chasm]] and co-create the [[Land Of Promise]]. These Goals serve as a constant reminder of our shared aspirations and the transformative potential of our collective efforts, helping us to stay focused, inspired, and united in our pursuit of a better world for [[All]] living beings.
