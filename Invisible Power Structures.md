# Invisible Power Structures

[[Invisible Power Structures]] refer to the hidden networks, entities, and forces that operate behind the scenes to shape global systems, events, and outcomes. Unlike [[Visible Power Structures]], which present a public-facing authority, these structures function in secrecy, often obscured from public awareness. They hold the true levers of power and influence, directing the actions of governments, corporations, and other institutions to align with their agendas.
