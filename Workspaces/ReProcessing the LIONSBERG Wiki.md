## Weaving a New Story 

And so it came about... 

That The People of Earth and Beyond decided it was Time for a change.  

## The Receiver

The Courts of Heaven and [[We The People of Earth]] appointed [[LIONSBERG]] as [[Receiver]], tasked with the [[Mandate]] of forging the [[New Civilization]] out of [[The Ashes]] of the [[Old]].  

## A New Vision, Philosophy, Strategy and Plan 

[[The Receiver]] recognized that it would need to rise [[Above The Chaos]] and articulate a [[New]] [[Vision]], [[Intention]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Program of Action]] in order to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

They would need to move quickly to get out ahead of the accelerating [[Science]] and [[Technology]], in order to harness it and [[Aim]] it on behalf of [[ONE]] and [[All]] towards the [[Meta Goal]]. 

The Receiver would then create a [[Integrated Delivery System]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] into [[Reality]].  

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] was forged. 

## A Story, System, Structure, Community, Platform, Project, Game, Way

The [[LIONSBERG]] idea was not merely a structure, a project, a community, a system, a myth, or a game. 

It was a total solution purpose-built to accomplish the Supreme Idea, and bring an entirely [[New World]] and and [[New Way of Being]] into [[Reality]] for the [[Good]] of [[All]].  

This demanded the creation of a single conceptual entity that included a story, a system, a structure, a community, a project, and a way of being, that if acted out comprehensively, would result in the co-creation of an entirely [[New World]].
