# Program and Process Management Guild

Given the scope and complexity of the total [[Program of Action]] that the [[Receiver]] needed to undertake, it was apparent early on that one of the core functions that would need to emerge early was [[Program and Process Management]]. 

The [[Core Team]] of the [[Program and Process Management Guild]] would be responsible for acting as an agent and liason of the [[Receiver]] to integrate and coordinate the diverse [[Functions]], [[Process|Processes]], and activities of the [[Whole]] as it worked together to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]]. 

## Program Management Responsibilities Include

- **Program Management** - Overall management of the Receiver's [[Meta Improvement Program]]. 
- **Management Policies and Procedures** - Facilitate development of appropriate standards, policies, and procedures to guide the safe, cost-effective, values-driven, and coordinated design and implementation of the total [[Program of Action]]. 
- **Project Delivery Methodologies** - Assist the Receiver in determining what project delivery models deliver the most value to the [[Program]] and to each [[Project]] at each fractal level of engagement. 
- **Issue Resolution** - Working with the Receiver and all statekholders to track and facilitate timely resolution of issues. 
- **Coordination** - Providing broad coordination of the full range of technical resources, infrastructure, and management processes necessary to 1) identity, 2) design, and 3) implement the planned improvements to [[Worksite: Earth]].    
- **Project Technical Liason** - Assist in identifying and resolving issues related to relational, operational, financial, contractual, technical, governmental, or other [[Federation]] concerns. 
- **Information Management** - Implement comprehensive information management systems and capabilities for design, implementation, operations, and maintenance. 
- **Program Controls** - Track critical program and project issues to manage process and progress, and thereby control time and cost. Including but not limited to costs, progress, issues, and opportunities. 
- **Program Reporting** - Prepare periodic reports to the [[Receiver]] for distribution to various stakeholder groups. 
- **Claims Prevention and Management** - Develop systematic approaches that ensure that the [[Integrated Delivery System]] integrates cost, quality, schedule, implementability, and value analysis as design criteria, in order to prevent time and cost overruns and claims. 
- **Conferences, Research, and Learning** - attend to technical learning opportunities to develop and maintain expertise, share knowledge, and further the global network of program participants. 
- **Integrating Design, Implementation, and Operations** - Establish policies and procedures for seamlessly llinking together design, implementation, and operations phases, including the use of technology such as BIM to assist in [[Integrated Project Delivery]] and technical coordination between phases. 

## Program Development Responsibilities
The Program Manager will also work with the [[Receiver]] to fulfill various remaining and ongoing [[Program Development]] responsibilities. 

These include: 
- Continuously improving the [[Meta Project Program Statement]]. 
- Identify, onboard, and empower Integrated Project Delivery Teams [[(IPD Teams)]]. 
- Oversee the development and implementation of plans and specifications for a continuously improving prototypical system ([[The Prototype]]). 
- Fully integrate BIM technology, blockchain, and all other required technology to manage design, implementation, prototype development, activation and operation of the [[New World]]. 

Program Development focused on developing a program that could design and operationalize a continuously improving soceity and world that provided every inhabitant the opportunity to discover and realize its [[Potential]], while progressively eliminating all non-voluntary dimensions of poverty.
