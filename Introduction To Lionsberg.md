# Introduction To Lionsberg

[[Lionsberg]] is a Myth. It is an Idea. It is Story. 

It is Myth about a time in [[The Story]] when things were in a state of great chaos, confusion, and decay. 

Out of the darkness, a Spirit rose up and hovered over the waters of [[Chaos]]. 

As it spoke the [[Truthful]] Logic that brings forth that which is Good, [[All]] things arose and united into a [[New]] and [[Higher Order]] Unity. 

The [[New World]] was at hand. It was already perfect, and it continued to become [[A Little Better Every Day]] because we were all working together in harmony to make it so. 

It 8 billion people decide to [[Enact]] the Vision and [[Story of Lionsberg]], it will become [[True]]. 

To help all humanity [[Enact]] the [[Vision]] and [[Story]], we have created a Game so simple and powerful, that as we learn how to play it together, our world will actually transform around us. 

Welcome to [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]].
