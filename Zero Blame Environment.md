# Zero Blame Environment

Consciously co-creating a [[Zero Blame Environment]] is critical to developing the [[Culture]] in which Integrated Delivery can flourish.

In an environment of Continuous Learning and Improvement, the standard of success is not [[Perfection]], but [[Continuous Improvement]].

If the [[Way]] the System works is to continuously surface efforts and improve itself, then [[Every Defect Is A Gift]] because it creates the opportunity to learn and improve.
