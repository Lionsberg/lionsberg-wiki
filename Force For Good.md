# Force For Good

The "Force For Good" refers to individuals, groups, organizations, movements and civilizations of Goodwill that actively contribute to the betterment of society, the environment, and the overall well-being of all living beings. Rooted in the Universal Principles, Values and Source underlying the [[LIONSBERG Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]], the Force For Good seeks to create a more harmonious, just, and regenerative existence by engaging in actions that align with the shared [[Values]] and [[Vision]] of a brighter future for [[All]].

In the context of [[LIONSBERG]], being a Force For Good means actively participating in the [[Citizen Led Response]] to the [[Meta Crisis]] and working towards the realization of the [[New Vision and Plan]]. It means taking responsibility for the well-being of our communities, the planet, and beyond, and being willing to work collaboratively towards positive change in whatever ways we can. By harnessing the collective power of individuals and communities around the world and throughout the cosmic order, we become a formidable Force For Good and co-create [[Heaven]] in every realm and dimensions we engage.
