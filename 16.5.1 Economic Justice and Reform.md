# 16.5.1 Economic Justice and Reform

The New Vision and Plan recognizes that unjust, unenlightened, and unwise economic systems and structures have primarily contributed to the Meta Crisis and perpetuated inequality, injustice, oppression, and exploitation of people and the environment. Therefore, it prioritizes the transformation and co-creation of economic systems and structures that are of a higher order than the failed capitalist and socialist models, and which promote truth, love, justice, compassion, stewardship, wisdom and fairness for all inhabitants of earth. This includes addressing issues such as poverty, supply chains, regional independence and resilience, income inequality, unequal access to tools and resources, as well as the fundamental reform of financial systems and the creation of new economic models that prioritize the well-being of people and the planet over profit. It also includes a universal jubilee to reset centuries of corrupt deals and accumulated excesses, coupled with a commitment based universal basic income for those who dedicate their capacities and resources towards improving themselves and their local communities in a way that helps and does not harm all other individuals and communities developing towards our mutual highest potential.
