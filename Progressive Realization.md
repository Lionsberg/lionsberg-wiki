# Progressive Realization

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Realize]] contains two distinct meanings, which are meant to [[Interact]] with and [[Inform]] one another. 

The first is Realization in the spiritual / intellectual / [[Metaphysical]] sense of the world, as in to become aware of or understand something. 

The second is Realization in the [[Physical]] sense of the world, as in to [[Incarnate]] into [[Embodied]] form in a time and place. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that these two poles forge a kind of reciprocating "diad" that facilitates [[Reciprocal Opening]] around the Central [[Phi Line]]. 

There are some things that we first get a spiritual or intellectual inkling of, that gradually leads to image, that gradually leads to concept, that gradually leads to thought, that gradually leads to spoken words, that gradually leads to written words, that gradually leads to embodied action. Or something like that. 

This directionality is like an emergence from the primordial depths of [[Spirit]] or [[Consciousness]] that gradually makes its way "out" into [[Embodied]] form. 

On the other pole are things that we [[Enact]] and [[Embody]], with no articulated understanding of [[Why]], that gradually find their way "up" into articulated / [[Conscious]] / explicit [[Understanding]].  

This directionality is like an emergence from the primordial depths of Embodied Action that gradually makes its way "in" to Articulated Understanding. 

There are times when we can grasp something with the edges of our consciousness long before we could ever speak it or act it out... 

And there are other times we find ourselves acting something out long before we could consciously conceive of Why we are doing it. 

These two elements can also be conceptually related to the interaction and [[Reciprocal Opening]] that occurs as a result of properly balancing [[Being]] and [[Doing]], and the [[Metaphysical]] and the [[Physical]]. 

[[Progressive Realization]] is the [[Process]] through which we "pull" a [[Potential]] into Articulated and Embodied Form through the proper balance and [[Reciprocal Opening]] of [[Being]] and [[Doing]]. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that these two [[Poles]] have to be balanced and unfurl themselves together in order to progressively reveal [[That Which Is Trying to Emerge]]. 

We need to Articulate as much as we presently can, and Act as Faithfully as we presently can, in reciprocating cycles, so that we can Progressively Articulate the Way we must Be, and Progressively Be the Way we must Articulate, so that we Progressively Realize the [[Best Possible Future]].
