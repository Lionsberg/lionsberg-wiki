# 4.2 Structural and systemic causes of the Meta Crisis

The structural and systemic causes of the Meta Crisis are complex and multifaceted, and they involve the interplay of social, economic, spiritual and political systems and forces. At the heart of these root causes are the values and beliefs that underpin these systems, which often prioritize short-term gain and self-interest over long-term sustainability and the well-being of all people and the planet. This has led to the overconsumption of resources, the exploitation of people and the environment, and the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few. In order to effectively address the Meta Crisis, it is necessary to fundamentally shift these values and beliefs, and to reform and transform the systems that are based on them. This will require a concerted effort at the local, national, and global levels, and it will necessarily involve the participation of individuals, communities, businesses, governments, and other organizations.

Some of the key structural and systemic causes include:

1.  The global economic system: The current economic system is based on a model of self-serving growth that is not sustainable and that is too-often driven by the pursuit of profit at the expense of life, the environment and society. This has contributed to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequality.
    
2.  The political system: Political systems around the world are often influenced by the interests of powerful elites and are not always responsive to the needs of the broader population. This has contributed to a lack of accountability, transparency, and trust in government, as well as to a growing sense of disillusionment, apathy, and loss of hope and agency among the general public.
    
3.  The media: The media plays a critical role in shaping public opinion and influencing political discourse. However, the media is often controlled by a few powerful corporations and individuals, and it is not  objective or unbiased. This has contributed to a lack of diverse and critical voices, as well as to a lack of informed and constructive debate, leading a scarcity of wise and discerning solutions and ideas.
    
4.  Education: Education is a key factor in shaping the values, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals and communities. However, education systems around the world are often underfunded, understaffed, and undervalued, and they are not always able to provide the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking that are needed to address the complex challenges of the Meta Crisis. At worst, education systems are being used to indoctrinate our children with false and deceitful narratives that contradict our shared wisdom and values, and uphold the destruction, injustices, and oppression of existing systems. 
    
5.  Infrastructure: Infrastructure refers to the systems, structures, and facilities that are needed to support the functioning of society. However, infrastructure is often inadequate, outdated, or misaligned with the needs of the population, and it is currently not able to support the transition to a more just and regenerative future.
