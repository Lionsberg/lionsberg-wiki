# We

Who is We? 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], We is used broadly as an inclusive word for the universal [[Force For Good]]. It can be thought of as the Spiritual Body of Goodwill, We Who Value Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom, and desire for Life and Consciousness to develop towards the fullness of its Potential, and Flourish in Harmony, Coherence, and Right Relationship with [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]].  

While acknowledging Our [[Ultimate Unity]], because of [[Free Will]] the term "We" is generally exclusive of the [[Forces of Darkness]], who would self-select out of such a description, and actively seek to undermine, oppress, harm, deceive, and destroy Our efforts to fulfill the [[Creator's Intent]]. 

**We** are Progressing [[Towards Oneness Through Love]], which is a reflection of the basic Spiritual element / essence permeating the [[Universe]]. 

Together, anything is possible. 

Together, everything is possible.
