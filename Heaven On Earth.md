# Heaven On Earth

The most famous prayer ever uttered contains the sacred words: 

_May Thy Kingdom, and Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven._

There is only [[One]] possible Vision and Aim, which is Absolute Perfection or the Ideal, right here on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

The amazing thing about the Ideal is that it is already perfect, and yet *it continues to get better every day* because it is composed of all creation striving together to make it so. 

This means that there is no end to partnering with God and One Another towards the betterment of our lives and our world. 

The proper orientation therefore is to continuously improve our understanding of the Ideal, while working together to make our lives and our world [[A Little Better Every Day]], and measuring ourselves against progress and not perfection.
