# Heaven On Earth

There is only [[ONE]] possible Vision, Intention, and Goal, which is [[Heaven On Earth]].  

The amazing thing about this Ideal is that it is already perfect, and yet *it continues to get better every day* as All Creation works together to make it so. 

The proper orientation centers around the [[Progressive Realization]] of **The Ideal**: Working together to make Our lives and Our world [[A Little Better Every Day]], while measuring Our Selves against progress and not perfection.
