# Justice

[[Justice]] is a foundational principle that guides the moral, social, and political dimensions of relationships and interactions, ensuring that [[All]] are treated with dignity, respect, and impartiality. It is associated with the principles of fairness, equality, balance, harmony, [[Righteousness]], and [[Right Relationship]]. 

This value impels us to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] in All circumstances for All concerned. 

At its core, justice is about creating and maintaining harmony and [[Right Relationship]] within the intricate web of existence, recognizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of all beings, and ensuring that each part of the whole is treated with [[Dignity]], [[Respect]], and [[Love]].

Justice involves the establishment and enforcement of laws and cultural norms, the distribution of resources, responsibilities, and opportunities, and the protection of rights and freedoms. The concept of Justice aims to create a society where all beings are treated with dignity, respect, and fairness, irrespective of their background, identity, capacities, or beliefs.
