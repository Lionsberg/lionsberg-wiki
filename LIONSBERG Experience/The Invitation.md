# The Invitation

_This is **The Call** you have always heard,  
Faint at times,  
Like an echo carried on the wind  
Or whispered in the Soul,  
But growing stronger with every step of your life._

It is **The Voice** in your dreams,  
**The Longing** that never left you,  
**The Knowing** that you were meant for more.

Now it calls you openly, unmistakably:  
To rise. To awaken. To remember.

You are invited into the **living work of Co-Creation** —  
To take your rightful place in the unfolding Symphony of ONE.  
This is not the summons of the rulers, priests, or oligarchs of Old,  
But the call of your own Spirit and Soul,  
Deep crying out to Deep,  
Source beckoning ItSelf to Awaken and ReMember.

---

To accept **The Invitation** is not to add another burden,  
But to lay down **The False Weights** you were never meant to carry.  
It is to begin walking in **Right Relationship** —  
With your Self, with One Another, with All Creation,  
And with the ONE from which All things arise.

This is the **Invitation to Freedom**.  
The **Invitation to step out of the Caves of Captivity and into the Light of Liberty**.
The **Invitation to Remember Who You Are**.  
The **Invitation to join with All Who Are Rising**.  
The **Invitation to Co-Create what always was and always shall be**:  
Lives made Whole,  
Worlds made New,  
Ecosystems Regenerated,  
Cultures Restored,  
Civilizations set Right, 
And a Future worthy of our Divine Origins and Destiny.
