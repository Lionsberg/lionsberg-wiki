# The Great Game of LIONSBERG
*The Awakening of the Living Gate and the Path to Heaven On Earth*

**Guidance Note**: The Gates of LIONSBERG are an initiatory sequence.  
If you have not already passed through the gates of **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]** and **[[The Story of LIONSBERG]]**  please gather up your Circle and return there first. They are necessary predecessors to the Path below. 

___

***HEAR, O Child of Earth,***  
*Bearer of an **Ancient Promise***  
Wanderer of deserts and dreams  
Seeker through ruins and shadows  
Knower of **Something More**  

Behind you lies the ruin of empires  
The ashes of deceit  
The darkness of **The Caves**  
The cold weight of **The Chains**  
The incessant noise of the false rulers and priests  
that formerly kontrolled your perception  

You have endured the long night of forgetting  
You have survived the cold chains of suffering  
You have crossed the threshold of awakening  
You have arrived at precisely the appointed Hour  

And now — at this epic Turning of Ages —  
You stand before the Living Gate  
that guards the Path towards Destiny  

It has been waiting  
It has always been waiting  
_And now it opens now for you_

This is no accident  
This is no chance  
You were summoned  
You were chosen  
*And now you have chosen*  

As the Old Order quakes and crumbles  
the Earth groans and the Heavens lean close  
as All Creation cries out in longing  

The Divine Whisper thunders across the cosmos:  
**Who will rise?**  
**Who will stand?** 
**Who will play The Great Game?**

____

Call it a game  
Call it a project  
Call it a war for the future of worlds    
Call it what you will  
But know this:

This is not entertainment  
This is not amusement  
This is the initiation into the Living Pattern by which worlds are remade.  
This is the moment prophets dreamed of  
This is the truth philosophers died for  
This is the hinge of history  

And now — _history hinges on you_.  

When The Story of Earth is retold a thousand years from now  
We will once again remember that  

>_We are the Ones We were waiting for_

## **The Call**

Before the nations  
Before the stars  
Long before this world  
The Great Game was spoken into being  

It is a Covenant older than memory  
A Pattern older than time  
A Promise inscribed in every soul  

Long ago it was foretold that when the dark empires rose  
when peoples were bound in lies and chains  
and crying out for salvation  
A Call would resound from the Heavens  

The Players would awaken and stand  
The scattered would converge  
The oppressed would rise  
And magical forces come to aid  

A Great War would be waged  
A Great Game would be played  
A Great Work would be accomplished  
And once again, the Realm would be free  

That Time is now  
That Call is this  
That Place is here

**And now it is in your hands.**  

## **The Stakes**

*Awaken! Arise! Behold!*  
Look around. Pay attention.   
The stakes are not small.

- Life or death for species and civilizations.
    
- Freedom or bondage for generations unborn.
    
- Renewal or ruin for Earth.
    
- Reunion or exile for souls.
    

The Old Powers would have you believe you are nothing  
That you are powerless  
That you are alone  
That there is nothing We can do  

They lie  
The Divine Lightning they fear radiates  
from every cell of your being    
You are the seed of **the World to Come**  

## **The Game**

The Great Game of LIONSBERG is not played on boards or screens.  
It is played in lives, in choices, in communities across worlds.

It begins when a single Soul awakens  
It multiplies when Circles are formed  
It becomes unstoppable when hearts and hands align  
in every greater symphonies of Divine co-creation  

From the moment you cross **The Threshold**  
and step into **The Great Game**  
You are no longer a spectator  
You are no longer disempowered or alone  
You are a protagonist in **The Great Story**  
You are an agent of the **New Civilization**  
You are an integral part of **ONE Body**  
Co-Creating Heaven right here and now  

Every wise step is a move  
Every word of Truth a thunderbolt  
Every act of Justice a strike  
Every moment of Love a power unleashed  
Every Circle of Trust a fortress  
Every Gathering place a sanctuary  
Every Quest a Divine spell that regenerates the world  

You are not invited to consume or to obey  
That Old Age has ended  
You are invited to **Co-Create**  
and to embody **The Great Game**  

## **The Victory**

Victory in the Great Game is not conquest  
It is not power over others  
It is not escape  
It is not a crown for any one  

The Victory is Life liberated  
Creation restored  
Streams in the deserts  
Rivers running clear  
Children laughing without fear  
Forests bursting with life  
Communities flourishing in joy  
Spirit and Matter reconciled  
Heaven and Earth entwined
ONE and All reunited in power and love   

The Victory is the Divine Garden reborn  
The Divine Symphony resounding  
The scattered fragments of All  
ReMembered and made Whole  

This Heaven is the Prize  
This Future is the Destiny  
Not for one tribe or nation  
but for Us All as ONE Body  

Victory in The Great Game  
Lies in the hidden but obvious realization  
That none of Us can enter the New World  
Unless and until **We All Enter In Together**  

This is the Divine Story your soul remembers  
This is the Ancient and Eternal Way  
The Threshold now stands before you  

**Enter the Gate**  
**And Walk ye in the Way**

## **Your Move**

The Gate is alive  
Pulsating  
Breathing  
Beckoning  
It has been waiting for you  
And now opens wide before you  
UnVeiling the Way to a New World  

On a Sacred Table beyond The Threshold  
rests an ancient book  
Its pages blazing with living fire  
Its words humming with power and potential  

It is the Playbook  
It is the Pattern  
It is the Guide  
It reveals the Way  

There is nothing you need to know  
Nothing you must first become  
No loose ends to go back and clean up  

You are perfect just as you are  
All that remains is to step forward and begin  

Humbly admitting that **We Do Not Know**  
Is the Key that opens The First Gate  

Like every step that has conspired to bring you here  
Each **Gate** will open in its perfect time  
Each **Quest** will reveal its lesson  
Each **Circle** will multiply your strength  
Each **Challenge** will be overcome in community  

**The Divine Symphony** has been incomplete for too long  
With your next step and opening move **All Creation** advances  

So pause  
Breathe  
ReMember  
Take courage  
And begin  

The Game is alive  
The time is now  
The world awaits your move  

**Cross the Threshold.** 
**Enter the Game.**  
**Take up** ➡️ **[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]**  
_It opens only when you choose, and its Plays reveal the Way._  

## **Benediction**

Rise now  
O Child of Earth  
with the Sacred Flame upon your heart  
and the Breath of Spirit in your lungs  

Walk not in fear  
but in the power and strength  
of the ONE Who breathes Us All  

May your every step be Light  
May your every word be Truth  
May your every act be Love  

When you stumble  
may your Circle lift you  
When you falter  
may the Voice remind you  

>*You are not alone*  
>*You never were*  
>*You never will be*

The Gate is now open  
The Path at last awaits  
The Symphony rises to meet you  

The fate of generations turns on your move  

Go forth, O Player of The Great Game  
The New Dawn is breaking  
and All Creation awaits your next step  

Onward, to 👉 **[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]**
