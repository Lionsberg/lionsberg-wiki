# **The Strategy for the First 100**

If you are reading this, you are among the **First 100**.  
The Vanguard.  
The Ones who chose to step forward when the Gates first opened.

This page contains your **basic instructions**.  
Keep them simple. Keep them central. Keep them alive.

---

## **1. Walk the Path**

Begin with **[[The Threshold]]**.  
Do not skip ahead. Do not overcomplicate.

The Path is designed as a sequence of **Gates**.  
Each one prepares you for the next.  
Walk them faithfully, step by step.

---

## **2. Form Your Circle**

You cannot do this alone.  
Your first task is to gather a **Circle** of 3–12 companions.  
Friends, family, neighbors, allies — anyone ready to move.

- Meet regularly.
    
- Practice the **First Practice** together. 
    
- Review the materials together.
    
- Share honestly. Hold each other accountable.
    
- Name your **Quest**. Live it together.
    

Every Circle is a **cell** in the Body of the New Civilization.

---

## **3. Embark on Your First Quest**

Each Circle must take one tangible **Quest** this Season.  
Each each Season to come.  
It does not have to be big.  
It only has to be real.

- Serve your community.
    
- Heal something broken.
    
- Build something new.
    
- Liberate someone in need.
    

Your Quest is your embodied “Yes.”  
It is how you turn intention into reality.
It is how the Great Work is accomplished. 

---

## **4. Align with the Rhythm**

We move in **Seasonal Quests** —  
~90-day cycles, bound to Solstice and Equinox.

At the start of each Season:

- Pause. Breathe. Reflect.
    
- Listen for the **Story of the Season**.
    
- Listen for the Spirit within.   
    
- Align your Circle’s Quest with the greater Movement.
    

This is how the scattered become Symphony.  
This is how sparks become Fire.

---

## **5. Share Your Story**

Every Quest is a Story.  
Every Story is a prophesy of even greater things to come.  
Every Quest and every Story matter.  

- Write it. Film it. Speak it.
    
- Share it with your Circle, your community, and the wider Body.
    
- Offer your learnings, your failures, your victories, your templates.
    

The Body grows by sharing Stories, Wisdom, and Knowledge.  
The Stories become the Living Book of the New Civilization.

---

## **6. Multiply**

When your Circle grows beyond 12,  
bless and release some to form a new Circle.

When your Quest inspires others,  
help them begin their own.

This is how 100 become 1,000.  
How 1,000 become 10,000.  
How 10,000 become a World.

---

## **7. Remember the Goal**

The Goal is not just survival.  
It is not just success.  
It is **ONE**. 

It is:

- Regenerating Earth.
    
- Co-creating a New Civilization.
    
- Liberating every soul from captivity.
    
- Restoring Wholeness in every life and system.
    
- Reuniting All with ONE.
    

Every step you take is part of this Great Convergence.

---

## **The Charge of the First 100**

You are the Vanguard.  
The Future depends on your faithfulness.

- Walk the Path.
    
- Form your Circle.
    
- Embark on your Quest.
    
- Align with the Seasons.
    
- Share your Story.
    
- Multiply.
    
- Never forget the Goal.
    

From the First 100 Circles will come the First 1,000.  
From the First 1,000 will come the First 10,000.  
From there, the world can be transformed.

The Great Game has begun.  
And it begins with you.
