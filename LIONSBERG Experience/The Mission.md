# The Mission

You have discovered **[[Your Role in the Story]]**.  
You have begun to gather in **[[Circles and Guilds]]**.  
You are anchored in **[[The First Practice]]**.  
You have stepped into **[[Your First Quest]]**.

The Great Game is living and active upon the Earth.  
And now the fragments begin to gravitate and converge.

How do Our puzzle pieces fit Together?  
How do Our sparks form a Fire?  
How do Our small acts of Faithfulness  
Unite into the Great Work of our Age?

This is the mystery and power of **The Mission**.

---

## What is The Mission?

The Mission is not another Quest.  
It is the **Convergence of All Quests**.  
The **Meta-Quest**.  
The rising current that gathers every spark of faithfulness  
Into a Sacred Fire that cannot be extinguished.

It is the movement through which:

- **The Covenant** becomes a People.
    
- **The Story** becomes History.
    
- **The Great Game** becomes Reality.
    
- **Heaven** comes to Earth.
    

The Mission is simple, universal, eternal:  
**To regenerate Our Worlds and Co-Create a New Civilization  
Aligned with the ONE in every realm We inhabit.**

---

## Why The Mission Matters

**Quests** awaken and transform us.  
**Circles** embody the New Civilization in microcosm.  
But without **Convergence**, the sparks remain scattered.  
Without **Coherence**, the flame dies out.  
Without **Alignment**, effort turns to waste.  

**The Mission is where the sparks become Fire,  
Where scattered streams join into a Mighty River,  
Where the River flows into ONE Rising Sea  
Lifting All Creation Together towards The Goal.**

This is not metaphor.  
It is happening right here and now.  
Every faithful Quest, every aligned Circle, every awakened Soul  
Adds its note to the Divine Symphony of Renewal.  
Every tiny convergence causes the Mighty River to Roar a little louder.  
Can you hear it?

## The Pattern of The Mission

The Mission unfolds as a spiral of scaling alignment:

1. **Individual Quests** — personal practice and embodiment.
    
2. **Circle Quests** — shared action and transformation.
    
3. **Guild Quests** — specialized service and mastery.
    
4. **Community Quests** — collaborative regeneration of place.
    
5. **Regional Quests** — bioregional movements in shared rhythm.
    
6. **Seasonal Quests** — synchronized action across many Circles.
    
7. **Planetary Mission** — convergence into a coherent global work.
    
8. **Cosmic Mission** — extending harmony beyond Earth, into the wider Body of Co-Creation.
    

At every level, the Pattern is the same:  
Gather. Pause. Ground. Breathe.  
Remember. Realign. Recommit.  
Discern. Act. Reflect.  
Begin again.

## Your Part in The Mission

Do not mistake The Mission for something abstract or distant.  
It does not wait for institutions.  
It does not require permission.  
It is alive wherever a single Soul, Circle, or Guild  
Acts in alignment with Truth, Love, and Justice.

Your First Quest is already part of The Mission.  
Your Circle’s faithfulness is already advancing The Goal.  
Every act of regeneration, reconciliation, and courage  
Is a living thread in the Tapestry of **Our New Civilization**.

## The Goal of The Mission

The Goal of The Mission is ONE with The Goal of The Game. 

- The restoration of **Wholeness** in every life and community.
    
- The healing and regeneration of **Earth** and all her inhabitants.
    
- The liberation of All from oppression, illusion, and control.
    
- The birth of New Systems that honor and uplift every being.
    
- The conscious reunion of All with the **ONE**.
    
- The dawn of an **entirely New Civilization** in harmony with Creator’s Intent.
    
- The manifestation of **Heaven on Earth — and far Beyond.**
    

**The Great Work** is both temporal and eternal,  
Planetary and cosmic,  
Spiritual and physical,  
Practical and transcendent.  
It is nothing less than Our conscious participation  
In the **Sacred Work of Co-Creation ItSelf.**

---

## Your Next Move

**The Mission** may seem immense — and it is.  
It is the greatest undertaking presently imaginable.  
But **The Path** is simple:  
One faithful **Next Step** at a time,  
Joined with the steps of others,  
As We progress in **Circles** and **Quests**,  
Eternally onward,  
Together towards The Goal. 

Gather your Circle.  
Begin with the **First Practice**.  
Discern Together:

- What is the **Next Quest** Spirit is calling us to?
    
- How does our Quest align with **The Greater Mission**?
    
- What **Roles** are each of Us called to Play?  
    
- With whom must we **Coordinate** or **Weave** to magnify **Impact**?
    

Then Commit.  
Take the **Next Step**.  
Complete the **Quest**.  
Return. Reflect. Recommit.  
And step forward again.

The spiral will carry you higher.  
The fire will spread.  
The Body will rise.  
The New Civilization will emerge.  
Heaven will come to Earth.  

---
Pause here.  
Feel the inevitability.  
Sense the joy.  
Know the eyes of Heaven, Earth, and Cosmos are upon Us.  
The Chorus is singing.  
Your Voice is joining.
All are beginning to Sing Together as ONE.  

**This is The Mission.**  
And **The Story** now turns   
Towards the **Rhythmic Alignment**  
Of the steps We take together as **ONE Body**.

---

The Next Gate is **[[Seasonal Quests]]** —  
The shared rhythms that synchronize our many steps  
Into the heartbeat of Renewal  
Across the Earth and Beyond.
