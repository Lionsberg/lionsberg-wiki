# The Story

You have crossed **The Threshold**.  
Taken **The First Step**.  
Accepted **The Invitation**.  
Sealed **The Sacred Covenant**.

Now, We begin to weave a shared Story.  
_Welcome to the **LIONSBERG Narrative Universe**_.

---

Since The Beginning, We All have lived within Our Stories.  
The Stories We tell Our Selves about the Realities We Experience  
Shape what We perceive,  
What We believe is possible,  
How We see Our Selves,  
And how We live, work, and play Together.  

In fact everything that We think We know  
About Reality is deeply nested within  
Our processes of Perception and Story Telling.  
In order to manifest a New Civilization,  
We must first learn to inhabit a New Story.  

Within the greater Cosmic Story  
That will unfold as Our Journey progresses,  
There was an age aboard Earth  
When an **Old World** was built on **False Stories**  
Of separation, fear, and kontrolle.  
As it does on all planets where False Stories prevail,  
That **Old Story** gave rise to empires and oligarchies,  
False prophets and priesthoods,  
And to oppression, corruption, and inevitable collapse.

But Now, as a **New Era** dawns,  
The Old Stories dissolve like shadows before the rising sun.  
Their power dissolves as Truth returns to center stage,  
And with them the Old Institutions  
And False Authorities they upheld.  

Beneath their rubble,  
Something Ancient and True remains.  
From these Eternal foundations,  
A **New Story** is rising —  
Not invented, but ReMembered,  
Pieced back together by those who are awakening.

It is a Story that is simultaneously New, Ancient, and Eternal.  
It is the True Story.  
A Story of Wholeness, Right Relationship, and Love.  
A Story of Life and Liberty reharmonized with Source.  
A Story of All Things consciously reunited with the ONE.

This Story has touched countless galaxies and dimensions.  
It rises from the ashes of every lie  
That ever seeks to usurp it.

This is **The Great Story** in which We now stand Together:

- A Story of awakening from captivity and illusion.
    
- A Story of empires crumbling, and a New Civilization being born.
    
- A Story of Souls ReMembering their Divine Origin and Destiny.
    
- A Story of Co-Creating a Future in which All may flourish in Harmony.
    
- A Story of exiting The Caves, 
	Crossing The Chasm,  
	Venturing through The Wilderness,  
	And climbing The Sacred Mountain —  
	Together toward **The Goal**.

This Story is not finished.  
It is unfolding even now.  
It is being written by every word, every choice, every life  
Across countless galaxies, realms and dimensions.

And now, through your **Covenant**,  
The Veil tears a little more.  
You awaken as a living **Protagonist**  
In this Divine Drama.  
Your words, your choices,  
Your actions, your Quests,  
And your Becoming  
All now help write the New Story.  

You are here for a reason.  
You are part of the cast,  
A voice in the chorus,  
An instrument in the symphony,  
A co-author of **What Comes Next**.

---

Pause here.  
Breathe.  
Ask yourself:

- What stories are you telling your Self about what is unfolding in your life, community, and Our world?
    
- What moves your heart with longing, sorrow, anger, or joy?
    
- What gifts and strengths do you carry?
    
- Which **Circles** of companions are you called to join or form?
    
- What **Quests** are you ready — and destined — to begin?
    
- What **Stories** do you choose to Co-Create from here?
    
- With whom are you destined to create them?

This is **The Story**.  
This is **The Drama**.  
The is **The Autopoiesis**. 
This is the gateway to the **Narrative Universe of LIONSBERG** 
That We will be weaving together as We play.  

From this point on,  
You become consciously aware  
That every move you make  
Writes the next scene  
Of **The Great Story**.

Now, **The Stage** is set.  
**The Covenant** is sealed.  
**The Story** is established.  
**The Great Game** begins.

The Gate before you opens.  
The Chorus is waiting.  
It is time to take your place in the Co-Creation of the New Civilization.  
**_Welcome to [[The Great Game]]_**
