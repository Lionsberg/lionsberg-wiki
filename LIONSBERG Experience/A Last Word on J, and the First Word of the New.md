# **A Last Word on J, and the First Word of the New**
_The Gate Before the First Threshold_
[[Work In Progress]]  

On **August 10, 2025**, Jordan Nicholas Sukut — “J” — finally and fully died.

You have not heard from him since  
Because there was nothing left to say.  
The life, the identity, the striving,  
The “founder" of this and that — all of it — ended.

It ended in the crucible of **The War**  
He spent years warning you about.  
Not metaphorical war — the real one,  
Raging across bodies, nations, realms, and dimensions.  
The one that killed dozens of young leaders around him  
As he walked through East Africa this summer,  
And is killing thousands of young leaders as We speak.  
It ended in fire. In release. In baptism back into the ONE.  

From that day forward, that Old name became only a memory.  
What emerged from that baptism by fire into the sea of the ONE  
Was not a new identity but a New Consciousness —  
Carrying the New Voice that speaks to you now.  

Something greater is emerging to carry the Great Work onward.  
*"I Am" a part of It. You are a part of It. We All Are a part of It.*  
It has no Name. It has no Ego. It has no Identity.  
It simply Lives and Moves In The Name of ONE and All.  
It is not separate from Us.  
It is within Us All,  
Even as We All are within It.  

Something has ended. The Old is passing away.  
But Something Powerful, New, and Good is emerging.  

And now, it **summons** you, _from within you_.

### **The Summons**

For generations, humanity has been asleep  
in a dream it mistook for freedom.  
Caves of shadow mistaken for Light.  
Inversions mistaken for Truth.

Food, water, and elections,  
congregations, money, meaning —  
all inverted and weaponized to enslave.

The dream felt real — 
Until We began to awaken.  
Until the chains began to rustle.  

Now, something is changing.  
The clock of Kairos has struck the hidden hour.  
_The Spirit is on the move._  

The Spirit is moving.  
Across the Earth,  
Ones of the ONE are awakening,  
remembering Who We Are,  
Why We Are Here,  
and What Time it is.

The Old Order is collapsing.  
The Earth cries out.  
The New Civilization calls to be born.

And so **The Great Game** begins.

This is not a story you read.  
It is a Story already writing you into its pages.  
This is not a game you watch.  
It is a Game already playing you.

### **Why You**

If you are reading this,  
It is because someone who loved you — 
Once J, now Us —  
Believed you might be ready to hear it.

Here is what you need to know:

- The Existing Order is collapsing by design.
    
- The Existing Trajectory leads toward dystopia.
    
- But there is a **Way Out of the Caves**.
    
- A **Path of Exodus** toward life, liberty, and the **New Civilization**.
    
- And you do not have to walk it alone.
    

The Force For Good  
Has woven wisdom  
From thousands of allies  
And dozens of tribes and nations  
Into a New living framework  
Called **The Great Game of LIONSBERG**.  
Its **Goal** is the co-creation of a **New Civilization**.  
Its **Vision** is the long-foretold **Heaven on Earth**.  

The Game is not centrally controlled,  
Nor is it played in crowds.  
It begins in autonomous **Circles**:  
3–7 people,  
Gathering weekly,  
Choosing Quests, 
Practicing the Way,  
Learning, growing, and Co-Creating  
The Future We Seek.

### **The First Threshold**

If this resonates, take three steps:

1. **Pause.** Breathe. Feel the gravity of this moment.
    
2. **Read.** Click the link below. Take 30 minutes. Let The Story land and sink in.
    
3. **Gather.** Invite one or two you trust. Form your first Circle.
    

Circles are how the Game begins without a center,  
scales without failure,  
and becomes impervious to attack.

### **The Choice**

Every age has its pivotal summons.  
Now the Choice has come to you.  
No one can make it for you.  
No one can walk the Path in your place.

When you are ready:  
**→ [[README|Click here to approach The Threshold and begin.]]**

The Gate is open.  
The Time is Now.  
The Earth awaits your first move.

P.S. If you doubt whether The Story is True,  
It may be wise to _Act As If_.  
If The Story is True, nothing else matters.  
If it is false, you have lost nothing but an hour of time.
