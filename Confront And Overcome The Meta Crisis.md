# Confront And Overcome The Meta Crisis

Confronting and overcoming the Meta Crisis is at the heart of the [[Citizen Led Response]] and [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]. It requires a concerted effort by individuals, groups, and communities around the world to address the [[Root Causes]] of the crises and challenges facing humanity and the planet, and co-create the conditions through which the [[New World]] can emerge. 

To confront and overcome the Meta Crisis, we must:

1.  Recognize the interconnected nature of the challenges we face and the need for integrated and holistic solutions.
2.  Challenge and transform the existing systems and structures that perpetuate the crises, injustice, and oppression, and establish new systems that prioritize wisdom, regenerativity, and justice. 
3.  Embrace a [[New Vision]] for the future that is grounded in our shared values and principles, and that reflects the diverse perspectives and needs of all people and the planet.
4.  Empower individuals and communities to take individual, local and collective action towards this vision through purposeful engagement, collaboration, and co-creation.
5.  Innovate and leverage technology and other tools to drive rapid and scalable change towards a flourishing future for all. 
6. Forge a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] through the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]] (or better). 

Confronting and overcoming the Meta Crisis is not an easy task, but it is a necessary one. It requires us to step outside of our comfort zones and work together towards a common goal, with a shared sense of purpose, determination, and hope. It requires us to be bold, courageous, and persistent in the face of challenges and setbacks.

Through the Citizen Led Response and The Great Game of Lionsberg, we can co-create a movement of individuals and communities that are committed to confronting and overcoming the Meta Crisis and forging a new future for humanity and the planet.
