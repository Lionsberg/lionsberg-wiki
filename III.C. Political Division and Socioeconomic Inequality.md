# III.C. Political Division and Socioeconomic Inequality

Despite its founding ideals of unity, justice, and equality for all, America has struggled with political division and socioeconomic inequality since its inception. From the beginning, the ideals of the American Dream were not fully realized, or intentionally subverted, for many groups, including women, people of color, and indigenous peoples. The fight for equality and justice has been ongoing, and while progress has been made, the harsh reality is that there are still significant disparities in political power, economic opportunity, and social mobility that exist in America today.

Political division has been a persistent problem in America, with different groups and interests vying for power and influence. This division has been exacerbated by an increasingly polarized political landscape, where compromise and cooperation are in short supply. Political division has also been driven by economic inequality, with the wealthy and powerful using their resources to maintain their influence and to further their own interests, while resisting efforts to liberate and elevate those upholding their privilege, positions and power. This has led to a situation where the voices of the marginalized, the poor, and the "regular folks" are often not heard, and where the political system is not representative of the diverse interests and needs of the American people.

Economic inequality is another major challenge facing America today. Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, there are still millions of Americans living in poverty and struggling to make ends meet. The gap between the rich and the poor remains persistently wide, leading to a situation where the American Dream feels hopelessly out of reach for many. The systemic barriers to economic opportunity, including lack of access to quality education, job training, financial resources, and affordable healthcare and childcare, are major contributors to this inequality.

The political division and socioeconomic inequality that exist in America today are a betrayal of the basic ideals of the American Dream and a failure of the American Spirit. The American Spirit, rooted in the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God," is a spirit of compassion, justice, and equality. It is this spirit that must be restored if America is to overcome the challenges of political division and socioeconomic inequality and to achieve its full potential. 

In order to move forward, Americans must work together across political and economic divides, to build bridges of understanding and cooperation. This requires a commitment to the ideals of the unifying American Dream, and a willingness to put aside personal and short term interests in order to create a better future for all. By working together in partnership with God and one another, we can overcome the challenges of political division and socioeconomic inequality, and co-create a nation and a world that works for all people, and all generations of life.
