# Subscription Agreement

A subscription agreement refers to a legal contract between an individual or an organization and the System, Organization, or Initiative they are subscribing to. 

A subscription agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which the individual or organization agrees to subscribe to the services, products, or opportunities offered. The agreement lays out the rights and responsibilities of each party, and defines the terms of their relationship. 

A subscription agreement often also outlines the milestones through which the initiative will progress, and the various "gates" of commitment associated with each milestone. 

For example, in a complex real-estate venture, the subscription might start with a statement of interest, progress to a statement of intent, and then progress through various levels of contribution and commitment as the project moves from concept, to design, to approval, to construction, to occupancy and operations. 

Having a clear and well-defined subscription agreement helps ensure that all parties understand their obligations and can avoid disputes in the future, while protecting all parties as the initiative moves through various "stage gates" of maturity. It also helps establish a clear and structured relationship, which can facilitate efficient and effective delivery of services, products, or milestones.
