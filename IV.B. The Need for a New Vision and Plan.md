# IV.B. The Need for a New Vision and Plan

The [[New American Revolution]] must be guided by a clear and compelling [[New Vision and Plan]]. This Vision must be rooted in the universal and eternal ideals of the American Dream, and must be a vision of unity, justice, and equality for all. It must be a vision of a future where political division, poverty, and injustice are a thing of the past, where corruption and exploitation have no place, and where the American Spirit shines brightly in the world through the spirit, hearts, minds, and actions of her transformed citizens.

This New Vision must be accompanied by a comprehensive and achievable New Plan that outlines the specific strategies, milestones and steps needed to realize the vision. This plan must be grounded in timeless wisdom, principles, and values, and must be developed in partnership with God and all citizens. It must be a plan that addresses the root causes of the challenges facing America and the world, and that lays out a clear roadmap for creating a more just, secure, and abundant future for All.

The [[New Vision and Plan]] must address all the major issues facing America, including political division, socioeconomic inequality, technological transformation, corruption and exploitation, declining global influence, and the crisis of culture and values. It must be a plan that brings people together across political and socioeconomic divides, that inspires and empowers the American people, and that leads to a more just, secure, and abundant future not just for Americans, but for the world. 

The New Vision and Plan must be more than just words on paper. It must be a living, breathing, and dynamic plan that is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and realities of the world. It must be a plan that is embraced by all Americans, and that is implemented with courage, determination, and unwavering commitment to our highest uniting values and ideals. This means that by definition it cannot and will not arise from the corrupt parties and structures presently striving to keep us fearful and divided. 

In short, the New American Revolution must be guided by a clear and compelling New Vision and Plan, rooted in timeless wisdom, principles, and values, and developed in partnership with God and all people, if it is to succeed in restoring the American Spirit and keeping the American Dream from devolving into a nightmare.
