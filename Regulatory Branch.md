# Regulatory Branch

Beyond the three general branches of governance listen above lie an array of functional Groups that hold the entire System within the [[Range of Tolerance]] for each [[Function]]. 

These [[Functional Groups]] are responsible for regulating, empowering, and balancing the various functions of the Whole within their specified [[Range of Tolerance]]. 

These Functional Groups Include: 

- Governance Model Group  
- Economic Model Group  
- Culture and Society Group 
- Power and Ethics Group  
- Individual Development Group  
- Group Development Group  
- Community Development Group  
- System Wide Development Group  
- System Wide Master Planning Group
- Resourcing and Capitals Group  
- Relationships and Networking Group    
- Communication and Coordination Group     
- Brand and Marketing Group    
- Efficiency and Effectivity Group    
- Legal and Compliance Group     
- Policy and Politics Group    
- Governments and Justice Group    
- Independent Monitoring Body Group    
- Mergers and Acquisitions Group    
- Dynamic Knowledge Group    
- Wisdom Group    
- Continuous Improvement Group   
- Crisis Prevention and Management Group    
- Evaluation and Certification Group    
- Land and Resource Stewardship Group    
- Etc. 

The intent is for the System to organically emerge and complexify from seed state towards its full [[Potential]]. 

Thus, at any given time during growth many of these functional Groups may be handled informally, developing into formal Groups as the need arises.
