# 2.6 Fractal Fields of Agreement

Fractal Fields of Agreement are a core concept within The Great Game of Lionsberg, representing the process by which players establish shared understanding, principles, and goals within their selves, families, groups, communities and networks. These agreements serve as the foundation for collective action and co-creation, and are designed to be scalable and adaptable, allowing players to collaborate effectively at any level of complexity, from the local to the global to the universal. 

The term "fractal" is borrowed from mathematics and refers to patterns that are self-similar across different scales. In the context of The Great Game of Lionsberg, Fractal Fields of Agreement represent shared understanding and consensus that can be replicated and expanded across multiple levels of organization, creating a cohesive and unified vision for co-creating the [[New World]].

Key components of Fractal Fields of Agreement include:

1.  **Shared Principles**: Establishing a set of core values and principles that guide the behavior and decision-making of all players in The Great Game of Lionsberg. These principles create a common foundation for collaboration and serve as a compass for navigating complex challenges and opportunities.
    
2.  **Shared Goals**: Defining clear, measurable goals that reflect the shared vision and aspirations of the players, and that provide a roadmap for co-creation and progress toward the [[New World]].

6.  **Shared Resources**: Establishing mechanisms for pooling and sharing resources, knowledge, and expertise, in order to support the collective efforts of players in The Great Game of Lionsberg.
    

By developing Fractal Fields of Agreement, players in The Great Game of Lionsberg can build strong, resilient networks of collaboration and support, enabling them to overcome the complex challenges they face and to co-create the [[New World]] together. These agreements also ensure that the game remains inclusive, just, adaptable, and scalable, allowing it to grow and evolve in response to the needs and aspirations of players around the world.
