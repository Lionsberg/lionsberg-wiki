# Target Value Design (TVD)

One of the most important processes in the Program’s design is the use of [[Cost]] and [[Quality]] as design criterion.  That process is implemented through [[Target Value Design (TVD)]], a collaborative design process involving designers, builders, suppliers, estimators, and owners to collaboratively produce a design that provides the best value for the owner, in this case the [[Meta Community]].  

Through this process, the team designs to the budget instead of the conventional process of designing, then estimating the cost of the design, and then re-designing to eliminate overruns. 

Critically, this prevents the loss of precious time during the design phase that far too often results from designers designing something that is too expensive to build, and then going back to do [[Rework]]. It also saves the cost associated with this [[Rework]]. 

**_Remember – with the future of life on earth hanging in the balance, a day lost in planning or design is the same as a day lost in implementing._** #principle 

Once the expected cost is validated, a [[Target Cost]]is set to create a sense of necessity in driving further costs out of the project through a Target Value Design process.  

The TVD process evolves through four phases with four different goals:

**Phase 1: Planning / Programming** - Goal: Right solution, right fit.

**Phase 2: Design** - Goal: Optimizing Systems and the Whole

**Phase 3: Detailing** - Goal: Optimizing Parts

**Phase 4: Production Planning** - Goal: Optimizing [[Flow of Work]], productivity, and pre-fabrication. 

This stands in stark contrast to the [[Old World]] methods where designers designed in isolation, and then put their designs “out to bid”. Involving the design, estimating, build, and operations teams throughout the entire process ensures that all aspects of design, buildability, and operational efficiency are optimized in harmony with one another from the start.
