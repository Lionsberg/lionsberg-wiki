# The MP - The Lionsberg System

Among the various solutions around the world, one was discovered that had been purpose-built to connect and empower humanity to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], forge the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]], and leave in its wake the infrastructure and solutions of the [[New Era]]. 

The System was called [[Lionsberg]]. It was constructed in the form of a myth, an invitation, and a pragmatic purpose-built infrastructure. The [[Lionsberg System]] contained the DNA for a interoperable System of Systems that could be localized, adapted, and evolved over time.
