# 2.6 Deciding What to Do

In order for the **The Great Game** to unfold properly in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]], every individual and Circle must become [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], continually choosing and engaging in their own [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]] to advance. No one can tell you what to do. 

Unlike the companies of the [[Old World]], where "employees" were typically hired to fulfill specific roles, life as a Sovereign [[Conscious Agent]] — whether as an Individual, Circle, Community, Guild, Bioregion, or World — requires that continually observing the world around you, making sense of things, reorienting, dialoging, negotiating, and engaging in the most [[Valuable]] and [[Meaningful Work]] that you and those around you are capable of doing in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

[[The Right Questions]] contain some helpful guiding questions as you determine the [[Wise Right Next Steps]], such as: 

- Who am I? Who are we?  
- What is my / our purpose? 
- What projects are on or near our shared [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]]?  
- What upcoming [[Milestones]] could I and my Teams help make progress towards? 
- What other Teams would we need to collaborate with to ensure that the next [[Milestones]] are reached within the [[Critically Effective Time Limit]]? 
- What should we be doing, that is not currently being done, that I am able to do and passionate about doing? 
- What project / quest could be accomplished in the next ~90 days that would produce the highest quality and quantity of service to One, All, and the Communities and Domains I / we influence? 
- What valuable quest is most likely to keep me and my team(s) in our [[Zone Of Optimum Development]]? 
- What valuable quest would leverage our unique strengths the most? 
- What valuable quest would be the most meaningful and rewarding to engage in? 

From your deepest [[Central Animating Spirit]], purpose, and passion, the most meaningful and fulfilling action will flow.
