# A Little Better Every Day
The basic idea of Life, validated from a thousand directions and traditions, is to get [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

Small incremental transformations, compounded over time, are the [[Way]] towards the Goal. 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] uses various words to point towards this aspect of the [[Way]], such as [[Continuous Learning]], [[Continuous Improvement]], [[Continuous Elevation]], and [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

Getting A Little Better Every Day requires choosing a worthy [[Aim]] or [[Goal]], engaging in a [[Practice]] that advances you towards the Goal in a measurable and observable Way, and then continuously elevating and transforming your Self, your Teams / Groups, your [[Practice]], and your [[Goal]] as you progress.
