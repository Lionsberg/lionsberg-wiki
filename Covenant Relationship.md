# Covenant Relationship

A covenant is a formal agreement or contract between two or more parties, often involving promises or obligations. 

In a religious context, a covenant is an agreement between God and humanity, in which God establishes certain conditions and promises blessings for those who follow them. The concept of covenant relationship is central to many religions, and it is often seen as a special kind of relationship between God and humans, where God establishes certain conditions for the relationship and promises blessings for those who follow them. The conditions for the relationship are a way to keep the human systems aligned with the laws of nature and nature's God.

In the context of the Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the term covenant is often used to describe the relationship between Yahweh and humanity, where Yahweh promises to protect and bless those who follow Him, while imposing certain obligations on them in return. This relationship is based on mutual trust and commitment, and it is often seen as an eternally binding agreement between Yahweh and Israel.

While eternal and consistent in nature, the prophesies distinguish the Old Covenant, associated with Moses and strict elementary adherence to the written law, from the New Covenant, associated with higher order knowledge of God and partnership with God through the direct working of the Spirit of God within us. 

In summary, the concept of covenant relationship is an understanding of a sacred agreement between God and humanity, in which God establishes certain universal conditions, promises, and blessings blessings for those who live in accordance with the [[Conditions]] for humanity and life to flourish in right relationship with its Source.
