# Reciprocity

The value of reciprocity represents a commitment to mutual exchange and mutual benefit. It involves treating others with fairness and respect, and recognizing that our actions have an impact on others. It also involves giving back to the community and contributing to the common good. Reciprocity is the basis of [[Symbiosis]].
