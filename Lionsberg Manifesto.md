# Lionsberg Manifesto

_(2023.03.26 Draft For Review and Improvement)_

## Standing at the Crossroads of History   

We, the [[Citizens]] of the world, stand at the crossroads of history. As one era comes to an end a New Era emerges, it is clear that we are on the verge of profound transformation. It is self-evident that what brought us here will not carry us forward to where we want to go, and our future will be unlike our past. 

From North, to South, to East, to West, tribes and peoples around the world face a myriad of complex challenges that threaten our society, our economy, our institutions, our environment, and the very fabric of our shared existence. 

At the moment we need them the most, the leaders and institutions we once trusted have faltered - stagnant, blind, corrupted, and devoid of the courage and wisdom needed to confront the urgent and interconnected crises we face. 

From our present vantage point, we glimpse the perilous path towards failure and decline, and discern the looming specters of chaos and oppression that lie in wait should we stumble and fall. 

Yet even at this late hour, amidst these tribulations, there is cause for hope. The Meta Threat we must confront and overcome together guards a treasure of extraordinary worth - an unparalleled opportunity to awaken a global movement that reignites the fire of faith and hope, spurring collective action towards the Brighter Future we all long for. 

## A United, Citizen Led Response 

The [[Meta Crisis]] and the Crisis of Faith in our leaders and institutions underscore the urgent necessity for a united, [[Citizen Led]] response to this pivotal moment in history.

The Lionsberg Manifesto is a rallying cry, an impassioned call to action for each of us to join forces and work together to forge a brighter, more prosperous future for ourselves and generations to come. This requires healing and strengthening the regenerative capacity of our selves, our society and our planet, while forging a future that serves not not just one tribe or nation today, but all tribes and all peoples throughout the ages. 

We acknowledge the gravity of these circumstances and we recognize the enormity of our task. We call upon every Citizen to arise, unite, and take action. The time has come to awaken, arise, assume responsibility, to take control of the helm of our collective destiny as we navigate towards the Future We Seek. It is time to forge a New Path that resurrects our shared Vision and Values, upholds our common humanity, and regenerates our society and our planet for all current and future generations. 

In the spirit of the great leaders and visionaries who have come before us, we offer up this Lionsberg Manifesto as our battle cry and prayer for a brighter future for All. 

## Our Collective Inquiry 

As we begin to gather together outside of the ideologies and structures that have separated us in the past, we offer up the following questions for dialogue and discernment: 

1. **VISION** - What are the key features and acceptance criteria of a Vision vast, positive, and inspiring enough to unite us All? How can we collaborate to refine and continuously improve the [[New Vision and Plan]]? 
2. **ANALYSIS** -  What are the current forces and conditions bearing upon our communities, tribes, and nations? What conditions must we transform or co-create to foster the liberty, agency, and responsibility necessary to advance towards our shared Vision and Values? 
3. **ENGAGEMENT**: Who are the stakeholders whose lives will be shaped by the success or failure of our community, tribes, and nations at this crossroads in history? Who should have a seat and voice at the table as we work together to design and build the New World that future generations will inherit? 
4. **STRATEGY AND PLANNING**: What wise strategies and plans of action can we undertake to progress from our present situation to our envisioned destination? Which strategies and plans of action have been attempted and failed, and what missteps should we avoid repeating? 
5. **ACTION**: How can we encourage, equip and empower every Citizen with the resources, tools, and support needed to take individual and local action in line with our shared Goals and Values? How can we co-create a culture of courage, resilience, and perseverance in the face of challenges that may easily overwhelm us?  
6. **CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND IMPROVEMENT**: How can we forge a culture of wisdom, retrospection, and continuous learning and improvement? How can we learn not only from our own successes and failures, but also from the triumphs and setbacks of others, past and present? 

## A Call to Action 

We hereby call on all [[Citizens]] to: 

1. Awaken, Arise, and Unite Beyond the Structures and Ideologies That Have Divided Us in the Past

10. Forgive, Reconcile, and Atone  
11. Champion Courageous Servant Leadership

14. Prepare for the Great Transformation

## Our Collective Pledge 

As free [[Citizens]] of the world, united in Vision, Purpose, and Values, we commit ourselves to the principles and actions outlined in the Lionsberg Manifesto. We pledge our talents, time, and energy to the pursuit of a brighter, more prosperous future, standing shoulder to shoulder, helping one another, and not harming one another as we forge ahead on this transformative journey.

## Our Shared Destiny 

We, the free and united [[Citizens]] of the world, acknowledge the monumental task that lies ahead. The Lionsberg Manifesto and the [[New Vision and Plan]] serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration, a guiding light to illuminate the path forward as we embark on this Quest together. Armed with the [[Lionsberg System]] and the Word of Truth, and guided by the hand of Providence, we are the architects of our own Destiny and the co-creators of our Future. 

Together, let use arise and unite to forge the Better Future we all desire - a world that thrives on the principles of Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, and Liberty for All. Let us vanquish corruption, injustice, and oppression in all their forms, and lift one another up towards our highest shared Destiny. May the Lionsberg Manifesto and our [[New Vision and Plan]] rekindle the flame of faith and hope within us all, as we take action to progress together towards a Future that can be brighter, more flourishing, and more regenerative in every way than the past we are leaving behind. 

We have assembled an entirely independent [[Citizen Led]] gathering place at www.Lionsberg.org. We'll see you there.
