# Shalom

## Overview

Shalom is a concept deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, with origins in the Hebrew language. It encompasses the ideas of integrated peace, wholeness, and well-being, and is used as both a greeting and a farewell. More than just an expression, Shalom represents an aspirational state of perfect harmony, balance, and tranquility within oneself, with others, and with the environment.  

If the single uniting design principle of the [[New World]] is [[Love]], its outward manifestation results in the state of **Shalom**. 

## Etymology

The word Shalom (שָׁלוֹם) is derived from the Hebrew root "Sh-L-M," which means completeness, soundness, and well-being. It is closely related to the Arabic word "Salaam" (سلام), which also signifies peace.

## Significance in Jewish Tradition

Shalom holds a central place in Jewish thought and practice. It is seen as a core value and a guiding principle, permeating various aspects of Jewish life. In the Jewish tradition, the pursuit of peace is considered a moral imperative, as the Talmudic saying goes, "The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of Shalom."

### Shabbat Shalom

The expression "Shabbat Shalom" (שַׁבָּת שָׁלוֹם) is a common greeting used on the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat) to wish peace and restfulness to others. It reflects the belief that observing the Sabbath brings inner peace and spiritual renewal.

### Tikkun Olam

Tikkun Olam (תיקון עולם) is a Jewish concept that refers to the responsibility of repairing and healing the world. It is deeply connected to the idea of Shalom, as it encourages individuals to strive for social justice, environmental stewardship, and the betterment of society.

## Broader Interpretations

While Shalom is rooted in Jewish tradition, its core values of peace, harmony, and well-being have resonated with people of various faiths and cultural backgrounds. In a broader sense, Shalom can be seen as a universal aspiration for a just, equitable, and sustainable world, where all individuals can thrive and coexist peacefully.
