# The Story of the Tower of Babel

## Introduction:

The story of the Tower of Babel is found in the book of Genesis and tells the story of humanity's attempt to build a tower to reach heaven and the confusion of languages that resulted.

## Story Narrative:

After the great flood, the people of the earth were scattered across the land and spoke the same language. And they said to one another, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth."

So the people set to work building the tower, and it grew higher and higher. But God saw what the people were doing, and he was not pleased. So God came down to the earth and confused the people's languages, so that they could no longer understand one another.

And the people were unable to finish the tower, and they were scattered across the earth, each group speaking its own language. And that is why there are so many different languages in the world today.
