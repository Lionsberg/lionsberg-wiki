# Constitutional Amendments

Many of the governance systems of the [[Old World]] are corrupted beyond repair. 

Nevertheless, they are our bulwark against a [[Collapse]] into [[Tyranny]]. 

The [[New Covenant]] and the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]] is designed to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. 

As we [[Pass The Flame]] and [[The Body]] self-organizes from the [[Bottom Up]], we can voluntarily take up our New and [[Highest Citizenship]] without sacrificing or laying down any of our existing memberships, affiliations, or citizenships. 

When we hit a 70% to 80% critical mass in any given domain (family, organization, community, city, bioregion, tribe, nation), we can simply amend the existing constitutions and other [[Operating Agreements]] to realign them. 

In many cases, this will require that the overly-centralized and corrupted institutions of the [[Old World]] be shrunk by 80% to 90%, and the [[Resources]], [[Responsibility]], and [[Authority]] redistributed back out to [[Individuals and Localities]] so that [[The Body]] can properly function in the [[New Era]]. 

The [[System Wide Master Plan]] calls for all existing constitutions to be revisited, elevated, and aligned during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

This process will be entirely Voluntary, from the [[Bottom Up]].
