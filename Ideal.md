# Ideal

An Ideal represents an ultimate goal, aspiration, or standard of perfection. 

It serves as a clarifying and guiding light, motivating and inspiring individuals and communities to pursue understanding, excellence, continuous improvement, and the realization of their highest potential. 

Ideals are often deeply rooted in values and beliefs, shaping the vision and direction of collective efforts. 

Conceptually and psychologically, there must be an Ideal at the center of every concept, a clarifying Standard that illuminates the terrain. 

Although Ideals might be unattainable in their purest form, they provide a framework for understanding and evaluating progress, success, and the overall quality of life. They encourage individuals to transcend limitations and foster a sense of purpose, meaning, and fulfillment in their endeavors.

Because the pure Ideal is unattainable in embodied form, we must recognize that around every Ideal is the manifestation of wide diversity, and develop the spiritual, scientific, social and moral understanding of how we wisely and rightly deal with that which deviates from the Ideal, recognizing that all things deviate from the Ideal to some degree. This is crucial to ensuring the conceptual Ideal does not become a rigid and totalitarian judge, but rather remains a highest North Star or Aim to inspire and guide. 

The Ultimate and Absolute Ideal is [[ONE]], or [[God]], the perfect Ideal that orders all other Ideals within Itself.
