# Uncaused Cause

"Uncaused Cause" is a philosophical concept that refers to the idea that everything in the universe has a cause, but there must exist something that is itself uncaused, or the first cause. The concept of the Uncaused Cause is often used in arguments for the existence of a [[Creator]], Supreme Being, or [[Ultimate Reality]] that is responsible for the creation and existence of the universe.

In the context of the Lionsberg System, the Uncaused Cause is considered to be synonymous with [[One]], [[Creator]], [[God]], [[Ultimate Reality]], and Supreme Being, and is understood to be the Source and Sustainer of all that exists and the ultimate explanation for the existence of the universe. The Lionsberg System recognizes that the concept of the Uncaused Cause is central to many philosophical and religious traditions and provides a framework for understanding the nature of the universe and our place within it. 

For those who are unsure of the idea of a Creator or Supreme Being, the concept of the Uncaused Cause may be understood as the [[Ultimate Reality]] or ultimate brute fact, or the fundamental explanation for the existence of the universe that *by definition* cannot be reduced to anything simpler or more fundamental. Regardless of one's personal beliefs about the existence or nature of the Uncaused Cause, the Lionsberg System recognizes the importance of considering the concept in the pursuit of wisdom, truth, love, goodness, and beauty, and invites humanity to explore and engage with the concept in a way that is most meaningful and fulfilling to them.
