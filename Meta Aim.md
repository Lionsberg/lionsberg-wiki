# Meta Aim

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta Aim** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Aim of aims", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible Aims.

The idea of the **Meta Aim** is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual aims, with the aims of the various [[Groups]] we participate in, with the **Meta Aim** that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

Because the word [[Meta]] in the System points towards the [[Absolute]], it is intentionally not concretized. This is to avoid the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that occurs when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]]. 

The [[Meta Aim]] is [[ONE]] with the [[Meta Goal]], _The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness._ Or, the [[Kingdom of God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]].
