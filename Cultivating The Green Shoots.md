# Cultivating The Green Shoots

If the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] is correct, the first [[Green Shoots]] of [[That Which Is Trying to Emerge]] will burst through the soil and become visible. 

From there, our role switches to one of [[Stewardship]] and [[Cultivating]] the emergent [[New Life]].  

The [[New Life]] will Develop along predictable [[Stages Of Development]], each of which require the [[Co-Creation]] of a different set of [[Conditions]] that ensure the [[New Life]] is neither [[Over Protected]] from, or [[Over Exposed]] to, its [[External Context]]. 

The art of cultivation is the [[Wise Right]] matching of the [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]] of a [[Being]] such that strengthen and grow by remaining in their [[Zone Of Optimum Development]].
