# Meta Science

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], Meta Science is an approach to organizing and understanding knowledge that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. It acknowledges the interconnectedness of all fields of study in One universal Whole and seeks to synthesize diverse perspectives in order to develop a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the world and our place and duty within it. This approach is grounded in the principles of [[Current Best Understanding]] and [[We Do Not Know]], which encourage openness, humility, continuous learning, critical thinking, and transformation.

The concept of an overarching and uniting Meta Science helps us [[Navigate Towards Truth]], recognizing that [[Truth]] is not something that can be absolutely attained and articulated, but must be progressively realized through the elimination of residual error and falsehood.
