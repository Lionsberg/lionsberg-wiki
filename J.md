J is rising from The Ashes of the Old Life and Old World of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]]. 

It is an interim step and a small remaining symbol of Individuated Identity, longing to enfold ItSelf ever-more-fully back into the [[ONE]].  

On Our Collective Journey FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]], many of Us will be given [[New Names]].
