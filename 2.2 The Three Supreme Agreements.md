# 2.2 The Three Supreme Agreements

Life, Community, and Collaboration [[Beyond The Boundary]] revolve around voluntary [[Agreements]] and [[Commitments]]. 

**The Three Supreme Agreements** that ensure that The Great Game can be played indefinitely into the future, across all conceivable realms and worlds, in a [[Way]] that continuously improves, enhances, and enriches life for [[All]] as members of [[ONE Bodyx]]. 

1. [[Love One]]  
2. [[Love One Another]]  
3. [[Love All]]   

The Three Supreme Agreements establish the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] of [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]] as the foundational principle and defining essence of all interaction in the Sovereignty of LIONSBERG. 

From these, the entire [[The LIONSBERG System of Values|LIONSBERG System of Values]] is derived. 

What all of these Values [[Share In Common]] is something like a [[Central Animating Spirit]] or [[Essence]], that makes it intuitively clear what [[Patterns Of Action]] and Ways of Being lead to Success and Flourishing, and which lead to Failure and Death. Let's [[Help One Another]] flourish and succeed, and avoid failure and death. 

The Three Supreme Agreements are the backbone of the basic [[Covenant]], or [[Field of Agreements]], that protects all participants in The Great Game of LIONSBERG.
