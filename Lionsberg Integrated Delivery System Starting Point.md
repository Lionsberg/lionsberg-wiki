# Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System Starting Point

As a simple and pragmatic recommendation for beginning to engage in the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]], there five simple principles:

1. The [[Meta Goal]]: We are [[All]] here in service of ONE highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]].
2. [[Federation]]: Every [[Conscious Agent]] should federate with other Agents, and with Lionsberg as a Whole. This includes forging or joining at least one [[Small Groups|Small Group]], which acts as an Integrated Program Delivery Team ([[IPD Teams|IPD Team]]).
3. The [[Network of Commitments]]: Every Agent should make and keep Commitments _to_ other Agents, and secure and validate Commitments _from_ other Agents.
4. [[Aligning Commitments]]: Agents should endeavor to align Commitments with the [[Critical Chain]] to create [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]]. 
5. The [[Planning System]]: Even if it is merely through informal conversation to begin, Agents should endeavor to understand:
	1. The [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]    
	2. How their efforts align with and relate to the [[Critical Path]] / [[Critical Chain]] towards the next Milestone  
	3. What other Agents or Activities they depend upon ([[Predecessor|Predecessors]]), and what other Agents or Activities depend upon them ([[Successors]])  

	Lastly, Agents should transparently [[Tracking Commitments|Track Commitments]] in a way that is visible to the Whole, with an emphasis on the [[Handoff Points]] between teams.

It is the recommendation of the [[Receiver]] that at the outset, and perhaps forever, rather than making Individual Commitments, Individuals should federate into [[IPD Teams]] / [[Small Groups]] of 3 to 20 people, and [[Commitments]] at the [[Program]] level should be made, kept, and tracked between [[Groups]] rather than Individuals.

This will ensure that the weight of the [[Critical Chain]] never weighs upon any one Individual, and will help ensure there are no [[Single Point of Failure|Single Points of Failure]] in the System.
