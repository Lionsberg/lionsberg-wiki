# 2.4 Your First Season of Play

Now that you are settling into [[Life Beyond The Boundary]] as a [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] [[Conscious Agent]] co-operating in a Spirit of [[Love]] with your fellow travelers via [[Circles]] and [[Quests]] on [[Our Shared Journey]] towards [[The Goal]] of Greatest Worth...

 ...it is time to begin Being and Doing in Community. 
 
[[The Rhythms of LIONSBERG]] align the inhabitants of any world with the natural seasons that dictate life on that planet. On Earth, this creates a basic repeating cycle of ~90 day quests that begin and end on the solar solstices and equinoxes. 

In general, your first season will consist of getting your feet on the ground, discovering how to be and become, articulating [[Your Story]], deciding what to do, forging or joining one or more [[Circles]], choosing your [[Roles]], and embarking on your first [[Seasonal Quests]].
