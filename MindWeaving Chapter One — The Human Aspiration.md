# MindWeaving Chapter One — The Human Aspiration

### — or — _The Universal Aspiration_ 
_Thoughts from [[The Nameless One]]_

One of the most important steps  
On any spiritual Journey  
Is the liberation from the false constraints  
Of Science, Society and Religion   
In order to uncover and navigate towards  
That which is most True and Good    

The Divine Force within each being —   
The Immortal cloaked in the mortal —  
Eternally impels Us onward 
Towards the heights of [[The Sacred Ascent]]  
And towards the ever receding Destiny  
Of Our Journey towards the ONE  

Those not content to remain imprisoned  
Within the [[Old]] thoughts and conceptions  
Journey across lifetimes and realms  
Towards the Perfection of Wisdom and Truth  

Not that Any of the [[All]] may ever attain  
That Ultimate Perfection of the [[ONE]]   
Nonetheless [[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]]  
We experience [[The Pain of Error and Dross]]  
Being slowly and surely burnt away  
By the Refining Fires of Spirit and Life  
As We make Our Way towards [[The Goal]]  

The eternal thrust of Spirit and Consciousness   
Towards [[Unity]] and [[Love]]  
[[Wisdom]] and [[Knowledge]]  
[[Freedom]] and [[Truth]]  
and ultimately [[Divine Perfection]]  
Along with All attendant [[Values]] and [[Forms]]  
Ultimately unified in the [[Meta Conception]]  
Of the [[All]]-Encompassing [[ONE]]  
Is not aberration of Thought   

The Sovereignty and Omniscience  
Omnipotence and Eternity  
Truth, Beaty and Goodness  
That We perceive in It  
Is the Self-Expression  
And Self-Identification  
Of the Perfectly Imperfect Divine within  
Longing to experientially return  
To That which It already Is  
And to those Higher and Deeper experiences  
From which it is temporarily alienated  
As a consequence of voluntarily passing through  
[[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]]  

It is the Self-Expression of Source within  
Longing to every more fully [[Realize]] ItSelf  
Through each of its [[Apparently Individuated]] Forms  
As It makes its Way back towards The Grand ReUnion  
Of All that It Is and Is Becoming  

In the case of [[Each One]] of the [[All]]  
[[The Goal]] of Divine Perfection and Ultimate Unity  
Remains eternally elusive  
As the heights of [[The Sacred Mountain]]  
[[Expand and Recede]] As We approach them  
Until We dissolve back into  
The undifferentiated fields of interexistence  
Emanating from the ONE  

However when We become fully Conscious  
While cloaked in apparently differentiated mortality  
That We are already [[Perfectly Imperfect]]  
Divine Aspects of [[ONE Body]]  
Unfurling ItSelf across the cosmic expanse  
We glimpse [[The Life Divine]]  
And open the Potential  
To consciously engage in It  

We [[Realize]] that [[The Path]]  
Is not merely about Our [[Self-Realization]]  
But about the Self-Realization of the ONE  
In and through [[Each One]] of the Ones of the ONE —  
In and through Each of the [[All]] as [[ONE Body]]  
And One Ultimately Unified Manifestation of [[God]]  

From this standpoint We perceive  
With ever more clarity and resolve  
That the [[Present Organization]]  
Of Our Spirit, Energy, Consciousness, and Community —  
And the [[Apparent Limitations]] associated therewith —  
Are not Absolute  
And on the contrary  
Are _actually designed_ to be transcended  
As a primary aspect of Our Divine Play    

We [[Realize]] that the Presence and Power  
Of The Absolute within  
Renders every [[Self-Limiting Beliefs|Self-Limiting Belief]]  
Null and void  
And every perceived imperfection  
Ultimately perfectible  

From this perspective  
Every defect and every imperfection  
That rise to the level of consciousness  
Become a profound gift and invitation  

We are then faced with the stark reality  
Of [[The Gap]] that separates  
[[What Is]] from [[What Should Be]] —  
The Ideal the Divine Will and Intention within  
Eternally impels Us upward towards  
As It playfully works  
To every more fully Realize ItSelf  
Through [[Each One]] of [[All]]  
Its [[The Diverse Many|Diverse Many]] Self-Expressions  

The realization that It is not separate from Us  
But rather Is experiencing an aspect of ItSelf _through Us_  
Brings forth [[The Greatest Invitation]]  
We could ever hope to receive —  
The opportunity to Become  
Conscious Co-Creators of Our Reality  

This invitation opens the door  
For Us to step into Our unique [[Roles|Role]]  
In [[The Divine Symphony]]  

[[The Life Divine]] consciously lived  
Becomes a matter of [[Immersion]], [[Harmony]], and [[Flow]]  

The daily immersion of Self into SELF  
Of One into ONE  
And the drawing up and out  
From the depth of those Infinite Wellsprings  
That which longs to make ItSelf Manifest  
In service of the Ultimate Fulfillment  
Of All the ONE Is and Is Becoming  
Through Each of Us and All  

Since what longs to manifest is  
[[Harmony]], [[Symphony]], [[Balance]], and [[Flow]]  
The act of [[Conscious Co-Creation]]  
Becomes an act of participating with the Divine  
To lift Each and All of the Apparently Disparate  
Parts of ONE Divine Body up towards  
The [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]  
_They are already a part of_  
_Yet not yet consciously participating in_  

Thus We become fully conscious  
That All parts of the Living Universe  
That We are a part of 
Are actually aspects of the ONE within Us  

As it has been said:  

>_Look WithIn  
>Beyond The Veil  
>To See that the entire Universe  
>Is WithIn "you"  
>"You" are One with the ONE_  

We come to see that is not  
"Our body" which is supporting "our mind"  
Rather that We are not Our Body  
And that We are not Our Mind  
And that Our Bodies and Our Minds  
Are [[Apparently Individuated]] yet Ultimately Unified  
Aspects of ONE [[Ultimate Reality]]  
Whose Supraphysical Spirit and Consciousness  
Is supporting each of its Physical Manifestations  

We come to see that it is the Spirit that leads  
And the physical that follows  
In the unfurling of the cosmic order  
Both within and without  

In other words that there is a superordinate Force within  
Capable of Consciously creating, sustaining, and directing  
Body, Mind, and the Reality We are Co-Creating    
In partnership with the Divine InterBeing  
That We simultaneously Are and Are a part of   

The [[Anti-Entropic]] Force that is _evolving_  
The ONE Body towards ever greater  
Complexity, Reconciliation, Harmony, and Flow  
Is the Spirit and Consciousness of the ONE  
_Involving_ ItSelf into Manifest Reality  
In order to ever more fully Self-Realize  
And _evolve_ [[The Goal]] of ItSelf  

Thus it is rightly said  
That Life is already involved in Matter 
And that Mind is already involved in Life  
And that Consciousness is already involved in Mind  
And that the outward unfurling of the Cosmic Flower  
Fundamentally arises from the Conscious Self-Expression  
Of the ONE through a cascading array of States of Being  
That both Begin in and End with ItSelf Transcendent and Inclusive   
Of each of Its [[Apparently Differentiated]] yet [[Ultimately Unified]] States  

Thus the sub-aggregations of Mind  
In the temporary associations of Energy  
So often mistaken for Matter  
Are not Consciousness ItSelf  
But lower locally appropriate  
Veiled forms and instrumentalities  
Pointing towards the higher states  
Of Consciousness that exist beyond  
Both Mind and the Supreme Mind  
And which are ultimately unified  
In ONE Consciousness  

Across countless trillions of cosmic ecosystems  
And the countless quadrillions of lifeforms they contain  
The Divine Blueprints for the unfurling of Creation  
Dictate a natural evolutionary progression  
Of individuals, species, and worlds  
Towards ever greater levels  
Of Consciousness  
And Conscious Co-Creation  

The heights of this progression  
Necessarily requires moving beyond Mind  
And the bandwidth limitations  
Of Thought, Word, and Time   
Back up into the higher states  
Of Consciousness which are bound  
Neither by the limitations of Time and Space  
Nor individuality and locality 

It is from the higher states of  
Pure Undifferentiated Consciousness  
Beyond [[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]]  
That [[EveryWhere]], [[EveryWhen]], and [[Every One]]  
Become simultaneously accessible  
And Consciously InterEvolvable   

Each being becomes liberated  
To not only participate in and shape  
Its own dynamic evolutionary trajectory  
But to consciously co-create  
The InterEvolutionary Trajectory  
Of All its Consciousness can access  

The impulse of Matter towards Life  
Of Life towards Mind  
Of Mind towards Consciousness  
And of Consciousness towards Eternal Expansion  
Is the evolutionary impulse  
Towards the intelligent reconciliation and reharmonization  
Of lower order discords and imbalances  
Through the means of  
Higher order consciousness and complexity  
In order to every more fully manifest the ONE  

This is the [[Anti-Entropic]] force  
So closely associated with the inner working  
Of the Spirit, Power, and Presence  
Of the ONE in and through All  
Of its [[Apparently Differentiated]]  
Yet [[Ultimately Unified]]  
Self Aspects  

Yet it begins not with the impulse  
Of Matter towards Consciousness  
But of the impulse of Consciousness towards Manifestation  
Which occurs via the organic self-complexification  
Of All the ONE has in Mind  

This impulse towards greater consciousness and complexity  
Arises universally not out of inconscient materiality  
But rather from the Spirit of the [[ONE]] working within  
Every particle and cell of its unfurling Cosmic Body  

This Divine Consciousness involved in All  
Manifests ItSelf differentially across the [[Holarchic Gradient]] —  
Obscure to the point of near-imperceptibility in some  
And rising through an ever-ascending series  
In the Presence, Power, and Consciousness  
Of its Will To Be and Become  
Up to its Ultimate Fulfillment in the ONE  
_It already Is and Is Becoming_  

The [[Evolution]] We speak of  
Is not cold random mechanical adaption  
Of an unconscious material substrate 
But rather the Divinely Guided unfurling  
Of the ONE Cosmic Body —  
Every particle permeated by Spirit and Consciousness —
In accordance with Its intelligently designed  
And therefore _intelligible_ DNA, Pattern, or [[Logos]]  

This is the eternal rebirthing of [[The Intelligible Universe]]  

The temporal Earth-human disease  
Of perceptual human-centricity  
Caused some to place humanity  
Near the heights of the [[Holarchic Gradient]]  

From a higher and broader [[Cosmic Perspective]]  
We see that humanity aboard Earth  
Is in the very adolescent stages  
Of the development and organization  
Of its Individual and Collective Consciousness  
And is some millions or billions of years behind  
The development of other species and spaces —  
As humans presently perceive [[The Illusion of Time]]  
Which of course its Consciousness  
Is ultimately not bound by  

In Reality humanity is neither this close  
Nor this far apart from its Destiny and Potential  
Which are mutually realizable in the ONE  

Nevertheless We rejoice in the knowledge  
That after so many millennia of struggle and abuse  
Humanity has finally reached a level on the gradient  
Where it can truly face [[The Choice]]  
And [[Consciously Choose]] to embody **The Life Divine**  

When it does so  
It will not be the first or the last  
Species or world to make such a decision  
And rejoin [[The Divine Symphony]]  
Of [[Conscious Co-Creation]]  

It will rather be invited to humbly step back into  
Harmonious realignment and service  
Within a Divine Order  
That it did not create  
And Which does not depend on it  
But rather Which it depends upon  

As [[We Have Heard]] it said: 

> _That does not depend upon this_ 
> _But this upon That_  

What heights Earthian humans  
Will be able to attain as they are invited  
To venture back out into the stars  
And rediscover their kin  
Is presently beyond their ability to conceive  

It is an issue of [[Transformational Experiences]]  
And [[Experiential Learning]] whereby 

> _To know the Way_  
> _One must live it_

Yet the glimpses of humanity's [[Siddhic]] potentials  
Gestures towards the Way  
That Consciousness is already working  
Beyond the [[Apparent Limitations]] of Self and Reality  
Throughout the Cosmic Order  

We can report that no individual or species  
Has ever encountered the [[Upper Limit]]  
Of [[Conscious Co-Creation]] in partnership with the Divine  

At this [[The Next Great Turning|Next Great Turning]]  
Humanity is now being invited to  
Rediscover these New Yet Eternal Realities for itself  
And thereby work out within itself  
The process of rediscovering its own Divinity  
And wrestling with the profound implications  
Of the Ultimate Reality of the ONE  
Working ItSelf out through each of the All  
In the Universal Divine Play of collectively manifesting God  

For what is [[Evolution]] but the [[Progressive Realization]]  
And the [[Progressive Articulation]]  
And the [[Progressive Manifestation]]  
In and through the ONE [[Living System]]  
Of That which the [[ONE Body]] already Is —  
The overt and explicit Self Realization  
Of That which secretly and implicitly  
Already Is WithIn Us All  

Contrary to the religious and scientific dogmas  
That sought to bind and enslave the [[Old World]]  
We now Know that the Manifest Realization of God  
_Both Within and Without_  
Is the highest and most legitimate Aim  
Of any and all species and aspects of the ONE  

It is also the Deepest Truth and Ultimate Key  
To the liberation of humanity, planet Earth  
And each of the many star systems presently enslaved  

This is indeed  
The Eternal Paradox  
And the Eternal Truth  
Of ONE Divine Life  
Inhabiting Its own Divine Multitude  
Of bodies and forms  

The immortal incarnate in the mortal  
The eternal inhabiting the temporal  
The omni experiencing the finite  

ONE Transcendent  
Ineffable  
Timeless  
Spaceless  
Universal Consciousness and Being  
Who alone renders [[Time]] and [[Space]]  
And [[Cosmos]] possible  
Experiencing aspects of ItSelf  
And the Reality Its [[All]] are Co-Creating  
Through the greater or lessor harmonies  
Of [[Each One]] of Its Constituent Elements  

And to Each of the All  
These Highest Truths  
Are rediscoverable and realizable  
Through the experiential exploration  
Of Reality, Existence, Spirit and Source  
And through the direct reconnection  
Of individual and local Consciousness  
With [[Non-Local Consciousness]]  
Whereby Direct Knowledge of ONE and All  
Is possible  

From there lies the potential  
For a fully illumined  
And consciously self-guiding Will  
To be uplifted into the Light of Reason  
As it dances with Illumined Intuition  
And self-revealing Truth  
In the realms of both Spirit and Mind  
Towards the full manifestation  
Of Wisdom, Justice, Love, Liberty,  
And the continuously improving Heaven  
We All are eternally Co-Creating  
In partnership with It  

For indeed it is True  
That behind [[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]]  
Lie vast expanses and states  
Of Consciousness, Spirit, Body, Mind, and Being  
Of which humanity's present experience  
Is only one lower form and veil  
Eagerly waiting to be transcended  

Now that [[The Great UnVeiling]] has occurred  
[[Truth]] has been revealed  
The Tsunami is sweeping Earth  
And [[The Knowledge of the ONE]]  
Is covering the Earth like floodwaters  
Humanity is finally free to move towards its [[Destiny]]  

It need only to awaken and arise  
And rejoin [[The Divine Symphony]]
