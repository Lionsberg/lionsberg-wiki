# Integrated Delivery System

An integrated delivery system (IDS) is a system that coordinates and integrates the various components and services needed to deliver a product or service to the customer. It involves bringing together all of the elements needed to complete a process, including resources, personnel, materials, information, and infrastructure, in a coordinated and efficient manner. The goal of an IDS is to streamline the delivery process, reduce costs, and improve the quality of the product or service being delivered. It can be applied in a variety of industries, including healthcare, construction, manufacturing, and others.
