# Caution On the Powerful Creatures from Above 
_A Post in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]_
_December 2025 (Old Time)_

The tablets, scriptures and stories  
Invariably tell of powerful creatures  
Who forbid themselves  
From being imaged or named  
Upon pain of suffering and death  

They are interfaced with  
Only by the few they select  
As their intermediaries and priests  
Whose families and bloodlines  
Are assigned to rule and kontrolle  
Certain tribes and domains  

For those unlucky enough to be chosen  
The smallest mistakes or transgressions  
Of highly ritualized draconian forms  
Result in immediate suffering and death  

For example  

> _"Two sons took their censers  
> Put them in the fire  
> And added incense  
> And offered it to the creature  
> Which it had not commanded_  

> _And fire came out of the creature  
> And consumed them  
> And they died_ 

>_And the elder said  
>To the relatives  
>"Remove the bodies 
>From the camp  
>And do not mourn  
>Lest you too die  
>And the creature  
>Become wrathful  
>With the whole community""_  

While this story  
Originates from Hebrew scriptures  
The memories of hundreds of tribes  
Memorialize similar occurrences  
With the genocidal "powerful ones"  
Who ruled over them

By the Time  
[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]]  
Incarnated a few thousand years later  
He winced and wondered  
At the songs being sung  
To these dark creatures  
In the name of God  

Of all the grand deceptions  
And all the great inversions  
Across all the imprisoned worlds  
This was one of the worst  
Infections he had seen  

Billions upon billions of people  
Asleep enslaved and entrained  
Singing songs and bowing down  
To the dark beings  
Abusing and enslaving them  
While masquerading as gods  

____

The story above is from "The Bible"  
Which attributes the actions to "God"  

If you listen closely  
Even Vatican translators  
Will tell you that a different story  
Is told in the bibles  
Printed for the masses  
Than the books used  
By those who know  
**The Great Secret**  

The stories in Old Testament  
_Are not about God_  

They are about the **Elohim**  
A created plural class of  
"powerful ones from above"  
Who descended to Earth  
Claiming sovereignty over it  

They divided it up among themselves  
Warred over its tribes and territories  
And erected its systems  
Of government  money and religion  
To keep humanity  
Divided, conquered and enslaved  

As we hear the African elders say

> _"You will not find one tribe  
> Who will not tell you  
> That their systems of  
> Kingship, money, and religion    
> Descended from the skies"

>_"The imperial christian "missionaries"  
>Were not the first ones  
>To come bearing crosses"  

____

To brainwashed minds  
Who have been entrained  
In the lie for generations  
The stories are nearly  
Impossible to believe  
Even as hundreds or thousands  
Of elders and officials  
Plainly state the realities at hand  

Jordan was taught  
That The Bible was the final word of God  
That YHWH was God  
That religious orthodoxy was Good  
That humanity was Free  
That elections were True  
That governments were Ordained  
That America and Israel were Blessed  
That civilization started 6,000 years ago  
And the host of other lies  
Permeating the Earth  

Jordan ended up believing  
**The Story of LIONSBERG**  
And [[The Great UnVeiling]]  

What do you believe?  
Are you ready to admit [[We Do Not Know]]?  

Are you ready for an epic adventure to find out?  

>_"Beware of the ones from above  
>Who come bearing "gifts"_
