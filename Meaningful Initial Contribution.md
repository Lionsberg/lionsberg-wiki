# Meaningful Initial Contribution

Meaningful Initial Contribution refers to the act of providing valuable input, ideas, or resources when joining a group, project, or organization. It is a way to establish oneself as a committed and engaged member, demonstrating a genuine interest in contributing to the collective effort and success, and establishing a basic reciprocity at the outset.

A Meaningful Initial Contribution can take various forms, such as:

1.  Sharing Relevant Expertise: Offering knowledge or skills that can directly benefit the group or project, helping to advance its objectives.
2.  Proposing Innovative Ideas: Bringing fresh perspectives and creative solutions to the table, addressing challenges, and driving progress.
3.  Providing Resources: Contributing time, financial support, or other resources to help the group or project achieve its goals.
4.  Active Participation: Engaging in discussions, offering constructive feedback, and collaborating effectively with other members.
5.  Demonstrating Commitment: Showing a genuine interest in the group or project's purpose, values, and goals, and being willing to invest time and energy in its success.

By making a Meaningful Initial Contribution, new members can build trust, earn respect, and create a positive impression among their peers. This sets the stage for ongoing collaboration, cooperation, and success as the group or organization works together to achieve its collective aims.

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]] and [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]], each new Participant is invited to review the history, sacrifice, and Value created to date, and make a Meaningful Initial Contribution to [[The Founder's Fund]] that reflects their appreciation of the of the Work and desire for it to continue into the Future. 

The Meaningful Initial Contribution establishes an opening respect and reciprocity, which is then maintained and balanced through an ongoing [[Meaningful Monthly Contribution]]. 

The idea of voluntary Meaningful Contribution is illuminated by a Story called [[The Widow's Mite]].
