# IV.B. Steps for aligning intention and vision

Aligning intention and vision is essential for ensuring that individuals, teams, organizations, and communities within the Lionsberg System are working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives. The following steps can be used as guidelines to help align intention and vision across all levels of the system:

1.  Establish a shared vision: Start by establishing a shared vision for the team, organization, or community. This vision should be clear, concise, and inspiring, and should provide a sense of direction and purpose. It should align with the vision and intention of the teams with which the team is immediately collaborating, as well as the overarching and uniting vision and intention of the Lionsberg System as a whole.
    
2.  Align individual intentions with the team vision: Encourage each team member to align their individual intentions with both the shared vision of the team, and the overarching and uniting vision and intention of the System as a Whole. This helps to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and objectives, and helps to build trust and collaboration among team members.
    
3.  Regularly communicate and reinforce the shared vision: Regularly communicate and reinforce the shared vision within the team, and encourage everyone to keep the vision in mind as they work towards shared goals and objectives.
    
4.  Evaluate progress and alignment: Regularly evaluate the progress of the team in aligning individual intentions with the shared vision, and identify areas for improvement. Celebrate successes and acknowledge areas for improvement, and continuously work to align individual intentions and the shared vision of the team.
    
5.  Align team vision with the vision of collaborating teams: Encourage the team to align its vision with the visions of the teams with which it is immediately collaborating. This helps to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and objectives, and helps to build trust and collaboration across teams.
    
6.  Align team vision with the overarching vision of the Lionsberg System: Encourage the team to align its vision with the overarching and uniting vision and intention of the Lionsberg System as a whole. This helps to ensure that the team's work is contributing to the success of the broader ecosystem, and helps to build trust and collaboration across the community.
    

By following these steps, individuals, teams, organizations, and communities can ensure that their intentions and visions are aligned at all levels, from the individual to the team, to the team of teams, and to the overarching vision of the Lionsberg System as a whole. This helps to ensure that everyone is working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives, and is a key component of success in the Lionsberg System.
