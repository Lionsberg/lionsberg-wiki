# Meditation 54

The Right Relationship between our spirit, its Creator, and All creation is not about religions made by human hands. It is about eternal and universal Right Relationship between One and All. If your religion divides your elite chosen group against the rest of God's family whom you damn to hell, it is in absolute violation of the core premise of Right Relationship between the Creator and all creation. The Spiritual element is that which beckons us back towards Unity through Love. False religious tropes that use fear and division to control people and "scare them into heaven" are antithetical to The Goal.
