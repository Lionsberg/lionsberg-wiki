# Wise Right
After years of effort articulating [[Core Values]] in many organizations, we came to one  simple and universal guiding principle: 

_Do the Wise Right Thing, at the Right Time, for the Right Reasons, to progress towards [[The Goal]]._  

This single universal principle guides Wise Right action within the shared context of our overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]], without allowing any one articulated (and thus inherently limited) set of values distort behavior.
