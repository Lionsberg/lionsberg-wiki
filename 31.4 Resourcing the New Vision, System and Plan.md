# 31.4 Resourcing the New Vision, System and Plan

Implementing the New Vision, System and Plan requires significant resources, including funding, personnel, and infrastructure. To accomplish these objectives, two funds have been created which will be stewarded within the Lionsberg System. The first is the Core Team and Infrastructure Fund, which is focused on securing the runway of the Core Enterprise. This highly focused team and infrastructure serves as the backbone of the movement, connecting, serving, and empowering all other elements of the movement and plan. This program management, mission control, and strategy and communications hub is necessary to make many subsequent steps and potentials possible.

The second fund is the Impact Fund, which is structured as a fund of funds. This fund is designed to resource and empower the distributed network of core functions and initiatives around the world. The Impact Fund is intended to support the implementation of the New Vision, System and Plan at the local, national, and international levels by providing resources for projects and initiatives that align with the goals and objectives of the New Vision, System and Plan.

It's important to note that the Impact Fund will be managed by a team of experienced professionals with a deep understanding of the Meta Crisis, the New Vision, System and Plan, and the needs and opportunities of the rising movement. They will use a rigorous selection process to identify the most promising projects and initiatives, and provide them with the resources and support they need to be successful.

Ultimately, the resources provided by these two funds will be instrumental in helping the rising movement achieve its goals and objectives, and in creating a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all.

To effectively manage and deploy these funds and resources, new technologies and metrics are being developed to help track the progress, impact and effectiveness of initiatives, as well as ensure accountability, transparency and alignment of all actors involved. The idea is to leverage the collective intelligence and wisdom of the distributed global movement to coordinate and optimize the deployment of resources to the most impactful areas, ensuring that the movement's resources are being used in the most efficient and effective way possible to advance the Critical Path towards The Goal. 

In addition to these initial funds, the movement is actively exploring other financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, impact investing, crowdfunding, and philanthropic collaborations, to supplement and diversify its funding sources and help ensure the long-term sustainability of the New Vision, System and Plan. 

To protect against the New System being compromised by the exploitative monetary systems of the Old System, a Lionsberg Central Bank will be established to mediate between the decentralized community currencies of the New World, and the debt-dominated failing currencies of the Old World. 

The rising movement is committed to being transparent and accountable in its use of resources, and will regularly communicate its progress and impact to its members and supporters. 

The following are key considerations for resourcing the New Vision, System, and Plan:

1.  Financial Investment: Obtaining the necessary funding to support the implementation of the New Vision, System, and Plan is a critical component of resourcing the movement. This will require a combination of traditional funding sources, such as grants, donations, and investments, as well as new financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, impact investing, crowdfunding, community currencies, and dashboards and coordination for philanthropic funds.
    
2.  Human Capacity: The New Vision, System, and Plan will require a diverse and highly skilled workforce to implement the necessary projects and initiatives. This will require the development and implementation of training and education programs to build the necessary skills and capacity among the rising movement's members and partners.
    
3.  Technology and Infrastructure: The New Vision, System, and Plan will require advanced technologies and infrastructure to support coordination, communication, and the measurement of impact. This will require significant investments in technology, as well as the development and continuous improvement of new platforms and tools that can be used to connect and align the various actors involved in the implementation of the New Vision, System, and Plan.
    
4.  Community and Stakeholder Engagement: The New Vision, System, and Plan will require the active engagement of communities and stakeholders to ensure that the goals and objectives align with the needs and aspirations of those affected by the changes. This will require the development of effective communication and engagement strategies, as well as the creation of opportunities for communities and stakeholders to participate in the decision-making and story-telling processes that will guide progress.
    
5.  Regenerativity: The New Vision, System, and Plan must be inherently regenerative in order to achieve its long-term goals. This requires a focus on Whole Systems and Time Energy Accounting across all relevant bottom lines, and the integration of regenerative principles into all aspects of the movement's operations, projects, and initiatives.
    
6.  Security and protection: The rising movement needs to ensure the safety and well-being of its members and partners, as well as the protection of their assets and information. This will require the implementation of security protocols, emergency response plans, and insurance policies, as well as the development of a culture of safety and security within the movement.
    
7.  Legal and Compliance: The rising movement needs to ensure that it is operating within the laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates. This will require the development of comprehensive legal and compliance programs and the engagement of  experts to advise on legal and regulatory issues.

In order to fully resource the New Vision, System, and Plan, it will be necessary to bring together a wide range of resources, including financial, human, technological, and community-based resources. The key is to collaborate, align and coordinate these resources in an effective and efficient manner to achieve the goals of the rising movement.

The Rising movement also needs to be aware that every resource has a cost, and that the cost is not only financial, but also in terms of human effort, time, opportunity, and energy. Therefore, the rising movement needs to be mindful of how it uses its resources to create value, eliminate waste, and ensure that they are being used in the most effective and efficient way possible to achieve its goals and objectives.

This is an effort that requires the collective effort of us all, and the rising movement invites everyone to join in supporting this effort and contributing to the success of the New Vision, System and Plan.
