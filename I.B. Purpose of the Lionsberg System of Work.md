# I.B. Purpose of the Lionsberg System of Work

The purpose of the [[Lionsberg System of Work]] is to provide a structure and set of tools for individuals, teams, organizations, and communities to effectively organize themselves and accomplish [[Work]]. The system is designed to align and integrate the efforts of all teams, so that the outputs of each team in the distributed network can be effectively incorporated into the larger [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]]. The Lionsberg System of Work helps to ensure consistency in the delivery of projects and programs, and supports continuous improvement by providing a framework for measurement, communication, and feedback. Through its comprehensive approach, the Lionsberg System of Work empowers individuals, teams, organizations, and communities to work more efficiently and effectively towards their unique local and functional goals and objectives, while integrating the work of their teams with the work of the global [[Team of Teams]] as we advance together towards our shared goals and objectives.
