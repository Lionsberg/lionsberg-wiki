# Update for Plex 17 May 2023

Hello friends and allies,

Welcome to Day 1 of [[The Lionsberg Experience]].

## Where We Are Going

We are aiming at [[The Goal]].

## Where We Are

We have descended from the abstraction of the [[Meta Project]], reached the Starting Point of the **New Season**, and crossed over into [[The Lionsberg Experience]].

On May 17th, we had our third and final orientation meeting, and are moving into membership, group formation, and federation.

Additionally, we have a number of existing partnerships and alliances moving towards MOU phase.

## How We Got Here

The [[Lionsberg Trust Manifesto]] and [[Lionsberg History and Inception]] provide some background on how we get here to Day 1.

## Our Role

Our role is to be a servant of [[All]], connecting, empowering, and enabling [[The Process]] through which [[All]] subsequent generations of life can co-create their future.

## What's Next

We are going to begin [[The Process]] of inviting [[All]] 8 to 10 billion of us to become co-creators of [[The Future]].

Our [[Aim]] is for every human to receive an invitation from someone they know and love during [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] to join [[The Movement]].

As part of joining [[The Movement]], they will receive a 3 year period of training, mentoring, and support to learn and practice how to be and collaborate in this [[New]] Way.

The [[2023 Q2 60 Day Plan]] presents a rough outline of what's next, and will be refined in community over the coming weeks.

We will continue to operate a System Wide Master Plan, tied to Quarterly Plans, against which the decentralized array of Groups can make sprints.
