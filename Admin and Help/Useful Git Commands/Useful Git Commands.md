# Useful Git Commands

Use a Command Line utility like Terminal on Mac or PowerShell? on Windows. 

Change Directory to the root of the wiki. 
- For example `cd (drag folder from Finder window onto Terminal)`

- git status (get information about repo) 
- git add filename (add / stage one file at a time)
- git add . (add / stage everything) 
	- add in Terminal = stage in obsidian
- git commit -m "message" 
- git pull  
	- Subtleties here when wikiing in teams
- git push  

Note: Using Git on Terminal instead of in Obsidian can be useful if the git plugin in Obsidian gets overwhelmed with too many changes and can't process them.
