# Jonathan Sand and Peter Kaminski, 2022-07-18

We're meeting after the [[Wiki Posse, 2022-07-15]] call last week, and talking about branching and stuff.

We'll start playing with branches and stuff, particularly in the [[Testing Git Branching]] folder.

We're also talking about realtime collaborative editing and Massive Wiki, with:

- HackMD
- Obsidian on a VNC-accessible machine (collaborating in realtime)
- services that let you run a Linux-compatible app and multi-use it through web browsers
- (kind of) via Syncthing

Here's a [[General Git Branch Test Page]].
