 #StubPage - please improve

"A hashtag is a metadata tag that is prefaced by the hash (or pound) sign, `#`. Hashtags are used on microblogging and photo-sharing services such as Twitter or Instagram as a form of user-generated tagging that enables cross-referencing of content by topic or theme." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag
