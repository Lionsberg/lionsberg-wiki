## Recommended Community Plugins

_Remember to Enable a plugin after installing it._

- **Collapse All** - simple, useful button for the file navigator
- **Find unlinked files** - a little funky how it works, but super useful as you're building an information space

- **Obsidian Git** - if you're participating in a [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) that uses Git for sync and versioning
