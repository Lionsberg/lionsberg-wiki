# Linking

In wiki, we make links from one page to another.  (Then, there is a "backlink" implicit from the other page to the first page.)

We also make links to the web, and can be linked into _from_ the web.

In this wiki, we use double square brackets around words to make a link.  So, in edit mode, typing this: `[[Linking]]`, turns into this: [[Linking]].
