# Careful Editing of the Core
So that we have one voice, we ought to all be familiar with the core material. Enough to be able to speak with its voice. At least come close and then with group editing we morph the material towards the one voice. So reading the core material is an important first step.

One way to shrink this step is curate parts of it, alone or as collaboration. Then when we think itâ€™s ready, make it the executive summary of the thing it curates.

Ask questions, privately if you prefer, and incorporate the answers.

Comments are encouraged and perhaps we ought to nurture our ability to process and respond to them quickly.
