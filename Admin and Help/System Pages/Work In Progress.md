# Work In Progress

As reflected in [[The Story of the Builder]], everything about [[Lionsberg]] is a **Work In Progress**. 

We are discerning, designing, and building at the same time, as we labor in partnership with God and One Another to co-create the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

Expect changes, and big ones! Expect unfinished links, untied loose ends, gaps in the plans and specifications, and typos. Every aspect is a **Work In Progress**. 

For now, think of this as a joining an unfolding effort to design and build a [[City on a Hill]]. Pardon our dust, and don't forget your boots and hard hat. 

To join us on this transformative Quest, read the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]], fill out the [[Manifesto Response Form]], and [[Join The Platform]].
