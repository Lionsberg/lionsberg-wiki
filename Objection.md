# Objection

Individuals have the moral obligation to Object if they reasonably believe that the Group will be unable to achieve its [[Aim]] if the Proposal is Enacted.

Any member of a Group has the right and responsibility to stop the Progress and require improvement of the Proposal before it can advance if the Proposal will cause [[Harm]]. 

Objections should be framed relative to [[Progress]] towards the [[Aim]]. The Objection should address how the [[Proposal]] would  [[Harm]] the ability of the Group to advance towards its [[Aim]]. 

Individuals should balance their Preference and [[Range of Tolerance]], and use [[Wisdom]] to [[Discern]] when to Object, and when to accept something that varies from Preference but is within their Range of Tolerance.

As a general rule, the greater the [[Span of Impact]] of a Decision, the more [[Time]] the Group should be willing to spend to merge towards the [[Consensus]] that is always available with enough Wisdom, Time and Patience.
