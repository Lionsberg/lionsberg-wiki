# Destiny

In the context of Lionsberg, Destiny is viewed as a collective, shared destiny for all of humanity and the planet. It is seen as a positive and regenerative future that can be co-created through intentional, collaborative, and cooperative efforts of individuals and communities around the world. The Destiny of Lionsberg is a world that honors the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals and all Creation, reflects the Universal and Eternal Law of Love, rightly relates to the Creator, and is equipped and empowered to navigate towards Truth, Wisdom, and The Goal together. It is a future that transcends the current [[Meta Crisis]] and provides a regenerative and just foundation for [[Future Generations]] to thrive. Through conscious and intentional co-creative action, individuals and communities are capable of influencing and shaping this collective Destiny, co-creating a positive and regenerative future for all.
