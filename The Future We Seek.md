# The Future We Seek

The Future We Seek is a [[Vision]] of a world where humanity thrives, regenerates the planet, and fosters liberty, harmony and justice for all. As outlined in the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]], this future is built upon the foundation of shared values and principles that guide our collective efforts to [[Cross The Chasm]] between our insufficient present state and our more ideal tomorrow.
