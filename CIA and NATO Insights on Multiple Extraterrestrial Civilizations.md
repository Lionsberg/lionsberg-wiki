# CIA and NATO Insights on Multiple Extraterrestrial Civilizations

"The American people today  
If they knew the whole story  
Of what the security apparatus...  
(Is) doing to them and to  
Their so called constitutional guarantees  
They'd be rioting in the streets  

The Defense Intelligence Agency  
And every one of the at least two dozen  
Major security organizations  
Concluded that beyond a shadow of a doubt  
This secret must be kept not only  
From the american population  
But the world at large  
They have created a worldwide conspiracy  
Among governments to keep the lid on this secret  

Let me share with you what some  
Of the four major conclusions  
Of the (NATO) assessment were in 1964  

In 1964 they had determined in the NATO study — 
And I know for a fact this was the conclusions reached  
By (the united states military) as early as 1949 —  

Number 1  
Planet Earth is and has been the subject  
Of an extensive, massive, thorough, and detailed study  
By several extraterrestrial civilizations  

Number 2 
These civilizations have demonstrated  
An extremely advanced technology  
Hundreds or even thousands of years beyond our own  

There seems to be a process or a plan  
Of some kind unfolding   
The studies indicated and demonstrated  
That a development of some kind of program was underway  

Evidence collected indicated that the program 
Has been going on for a very long time  
Possibly hundreds or thousands of years  
And some of my associates and I have concluded  
That it's probably been going on longer than that  

The study concluded that there did not appear to be  
A major military threat involved in 1964  
And that they whoever they are  
If they were malevolent or hostile  
There was absolutely nothing we could do  
Because the level of technology demonstrated  
Was so far beyond anything we had   

We felt that if they were hostile or malevolent  
The game was up it was all over with  

What we are addressing here and dealing with  
Is indeed the major issue of our time  
It goes beyond the (empires and wars)  
It goes beyond politics  
The recent elections  
The famine  
The terror  
It goes beyond any major human problem 
We are currently dealing with on this planet  
Because this problem has been with us  
For thousands of years  
And is indeed the major issue of our time  

The assessment was an inch and a half thick  
It was supported by eight inches of annexes  
Supporting documents, studies, and research  

There were annexes on radar and electromagnetic effects  
There was an annex on optical and light analysis  
A beautiful annex on photographic and holographic analysis 
There was historical research and evidence  
From some of the top people at Cambridge and Oxford in England  
There was metallurgical and technical analysis  
There were atmospheric physics studies  
Biological analysis and autopsies  

The three issues I thought of at the time of being the most important were  
The psychological studies and the impact upon the human race  
The sociological effects and implications  
And probably what I have considered to be the most important annex  
In the study of all in terms of its effect upon the world population  
Is the theological implications and impact"

We concur that this is the most significant issue  
Facing the human species and the Earth  

The primary problems facing the Earth  
Are not and have not been primarily human in origin  
Nor can they be solved without forthrightly dealing  
With their non-human origins and roots
