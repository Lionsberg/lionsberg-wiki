# Help! I Am Lost

Hello Dear Reader, 

Welcome to the [[Lionsberg Wiki]]. We know it can be overwhelming, and difficult to learn to navigate. 

If you ever get lost, simply click this link in the [[Sidebar]], and come back. 

If you fall down a rabbit hole and want to get back to Where You Where, you can use the "back button" on your internet browser and begin clicking back through the pages you recently visited. 

Here is a soft table of contents to help you find your [[Way]].  

1. [[README|Lionsberg Home Page]], or clicking "Lionsberg Wiki" at the top of any page, takes you home to the main page. 
2. [[Above The Chaos]] is a creative stream that follows along with [[The Story]] in real time, personally and accessibly from the perspective of [[J]]. 
3. The [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] are more structured, formalized works. They [[Circumambulate]] the issues, ideas, and opportunities at stake from a number of perspectives.  
4. To learn more about the technology underlying the [[Lionsberg Wiki]], explore [Above The Chaos Episode 5](https://x.com/JNicholasOne/status/1710097546436083855) with J + Pete Kaminski. 
5. [[Lionsberg Core Documents]] links to draft agreements and works in progress that hold the space for emerge, co-creation, and continuous improvement.
6. [[The Lionsberg Co-Creator's Handbook]] is a quick-start manual for those joining the movement.   
7. The [[Lionsberg Lexicon]] is *definitely* a work in progress, beginning to explore key [[Word Tools]] that are being used and defined in the [[Lionsberg System]]. 
8. [[144 Threads - A Desperate Prayer to Weave Humanity's Last Best Hope]] lays out some of the key topics and concepts in one place, as a jumping off point to further exploration. 

There is lots more—well over two million words of interlinked writing—but this should be enough to get you oriented and headed in the right direction. If you would like to see anything added here, let Us know. 

Love and respect, and thank you for diving in. 

~ J
