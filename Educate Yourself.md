# Educate Yourself

Here is a guide to educating yourself on the issues and challenges facing humanity, and sharing your knowledge with others:

1.  Identify the issues and challenges that are most important to you. This might include environmental disasters, economic inequality, social unrest, or other issues. See [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] as a starting point. 
    
2.  Research and learn about these issues in depth. This might involve reading articles, books, and reports from credible sources, watching documentaries, or listening to podcasts.
    
3.  Seek out diverse perspectives and viewpoints on the issues. It is important to understand different viewpoints and to consider the pros and cons of different approaches to addressing the challenges. Be careful to avoid adopting any one ideology on perspective on an issue.
    
4.  Engage with others who are interested in these issues. This might involve forming or joining a [[Discussion Group]], attending a workshop or event, or participating in online forums.
    
5.  Share what you have learned with others. This might involve writing articles or blog posts, sharing relevant articles and information on social media, giving presentations, or simply having conversations with friends and family.
    
6.  Take action to make a difference. This might involve volunteering, supporting a cause financially, or advocating for change through letter-writing or petition campaigns.
    
7.  Stay informed and continue learning about the issues and challenges facing humanity. It is important to stay up-to-date on developments and to continually seek out new information and perspectives.
8. Take comprehensive notes as you learn, and be willing to share your notes to help others who are looking to get up to speed on the issues you are passionate about.
