# Citizen Led Public Private Partnership

Citizen Led Public Private Partnerships are a core feature of the [[LIONSBERG System]]. 

Citizen Led Public Private Partnerships are a wise alternative to the false dichotomies offered in the past, whereby core functions of society were operated by either disconnected and unaccountable public bureaucracies, or private for-profit capitalist enterprises. 

Citizen Led Public Private Partnerships allow for transparent and accountable joint ventures that draw on the very best of public and private resources, assets, and capabilities to meet needs, solve problems, and accomplish goals with continuously improving quality, and continuously decreasing marginal costs. 

This brings out the very best of free market dynamics, freedom, and creativity, within structures purpose-built to to serve people and planet across multiple generations, rather than capital in the short term.
