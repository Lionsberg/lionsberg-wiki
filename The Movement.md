# The Movement

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[The Movement]] refers to the universal drive of [[All]] things towards [[The Goal]]. 

"The Movement" refers to a diverse global coalition of individuals, organizations, and communities dedicated to addressing the interconnected challenges of the [[Meta Crisis]] and working towards creating a better, more sustainable, and just future for all in accordance with the [[New Vision and Plan]]. "The Movement" is not a single, unified organization; instead, it comprises various groups and initiatives that share a common intention, vision and values, and are helping one another progress FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]]. It seeks to empower and inspire people from all walks of life to take action, foster change, and contribute to the collective transformation of our lives and our world.

In the context of the [[New Vision and Plan]], "The Movement" plays a crucial role in driving the change needed to realize the New Vision and Plan. By building a strong, diverse, and united global coalition, "The Movement" can help create the momentum and collective will needed to transform our world for the better.
