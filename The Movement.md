# The Movement

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[The Movement]] refers to the universal drive of [[All]] things towards [[The Goal]]. 

"The Movement" refers to a diverse global coalition of individuals, organizations, and communities dedicated to addressing the interconnected challenges of the [[Meta Crisis]] and working towards co-creating a better, regenerative, and just future for all in accordance with the [[New Vision and Plan]]. "The Movement" is not a single, unified organization; instead, it comprises a vast diversity groups and initiatives that share a common intention, vision and values as they evolve into [[One Body]]. It seeks to empower and inspire people from all walks of life to take action, inspire hope, and contribute to the collective transformation of our lives and our world.

The [[Lionsberg System]] was purpose-built to connect and empower this [[Optimally Decentralized]] Force For Good in [[The Mission]] to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], and co-creation [[Heaven On Earth]].
