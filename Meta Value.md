# Meta Value

The word **Meta** as it is used in the [[LIONSBERG System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, all encompassing, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], the Meta Value that contains and unites [[All]] other values within itself is by definition [[ONE]] / [[Creator]] / [[God]].
