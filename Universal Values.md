# Universal Values

The entire [[Lionsberg System]] and [[Meta System]] are centered around self-evident Universal Values flowing from [[ONE]] and known to [[All]]. 

In English, their underlying reality can be pointed towards with [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] such as: 

[[Truth]]  
[[Love]]  
[[Justice]]  
[[Stewardship]]
[[Wisdom]]  

The entire set of [[Values]], or the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], can be derived from the Spirit or Essence of [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]].
