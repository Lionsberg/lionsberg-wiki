# Founding Leader Phase At Federal Level

Through the Founding Leader phase at the federal level, [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is holding space for the emergence and pattern integrity of the Whole. 

Like all other Founding Leaders, Jordan will be held to the same transparency and accountability requirements to a Wisdom Board, while the System / Federation / Community advances towards fully legally-activated Self-Governance. 

Early advisors have discerned that it would be unwise to establish a legal board during the Founding Leaders period, and that a Wisdom Board should be established instead to "Act Out" the new governance paradigm as Self-Governance emerges across the Federation and members get nominated to the Domain Assemblies and Lionsberg General Assembly, which in turn will elect the Lionsberg Executive Council. 

The tentative target is to have a full-functioning Lionsberg General Assembly that appoints a Lionsberg Executive Council by September 2024. 

It is anticipated that Jordan may serve the first two four year terms as Chief Executive of the [[Core Enterprise]] as it expands out towards the [[Aim]] of 1 billion small groups in 7 years. 

Jordan is also serving as the sole Board member of the [[Provisional Structure]] until such a time as the [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] can appoint a sub-committee to govern the entity.
