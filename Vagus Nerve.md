# Vagus Nerve

The main nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system, and main communication superhighway between brain and body. 

Relative to escaping anxiety and experiencing positive emotion, it is the Vagus Nerve that carries the signals from the Prefrontal Cortex down to the body which "dial down" the energy level in the "default-on" [[Autonomic Nervous System]].
