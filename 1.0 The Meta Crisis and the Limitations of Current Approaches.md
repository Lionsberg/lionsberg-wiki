# 1.0 The Meta Crisis and the Limitations of Current Approaches

The Meta Crisis is the existential threat facing humanity and all life on Earth today. It is the result of a deeply flawed and inadequate Old Operating System that has led to environmental degradation, poverty and economic inequality, social injustice and discrimination, disease, and unjust and unenlightened governance and political systems.  

The core flaw of the Old Operating System is that it is dominated by soulless legal abstractions (governments and corporations), who as soulless legal entities inherently are not capable of deep human love, compassion, and concern for the eternal wellbeing of all generations of life. 

Current approaches to addressing the Meta Crisis have been ineffective in addressing its root causes and preventing future crises.   This is because they are largely focused on the symptoms, rather than the root cause, which is the corrupt and inadequate way the human operating system is presently structured.  These approaches have been limited by a narrow focus on individual issues and symptoms, rather than addressing the systemic and structural causes of the Meta Crisis. They have also been limited by a lack of comprehensive and holistic solutions, as well as a lack of transparency, accountability, and participation in decision-making processes.

The Lionsberg System and Approach offers a comprehensive and holistic solution to the Meta Crisis, by addressing its root causes and transforming the the human operating systems FROM the Old TO the New. It recognizes that the Meta Crisis is an unprecedented challenge that requires an unprecedented solution, and that what got us here will not get us to where we all want to go.

It aims to empower individuals, communities, and organizations to take charge of their own development and well-being, by providing access to the resources, tools, knowledge, and support needed to address their specific needs and circumstances and develop towards the fullness of their potential. The Lionsberg System and Approach is a fundamental systems transformation and redesign of the total social, economic, and political systems currently plaguing and exploiting society, especially the poor and disadvantaged. It will be a voluntary and collective effort to create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth, by making more visible the interconnectedness of all aspects of life, the potential for flourishing and abundant life and right relationship that is right at hand, and the development of systems and structures that support the temporal and eternal well-being of all inhabitants of Earth, both now and for future generations. It is a call to action for humanity to work together in the 7 year window between 2023 and 2030 to adopt the Lionsberg System and Approach, thereby transforming the core operating system of humanity and paving the way for the New Vision and Plan to be realized for all citizens of earth.
