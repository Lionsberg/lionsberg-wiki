# 6.4 What Happens if we Miss the Window?

  
The 7-year window of opportunity for implementing the Lionsberg System, Strategy and Plan is considered critical for addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. If this window of opportunity is missed, the consequences could be severe.

We do not know exactly what will happen if the window is missed because we are dealing with complex systems far beyond our ability to model them, but there are many different scenarios in which a combination of human and natural events could trigger total systems collapse. This could cause suffering and death for many of the earth's inhabitants, and it could take hundreds of years to recover from. The non-zero probability of such a collapse demands immediate universal action to the absolute best of our individual and collective capabilities.

It is also important to consider the advancements in weapons technology since the 1970s. By the 1970s, we had already developed weapons powerful enough to destroy the entire human species with one hour. Since then, weapons technology has continued to advance, and there is now a quantum leap in weaponry in development that is orders of magnitude more dangerous than the nuclear weapons of the 1970s. It is more true than ever that the push of one button by an authorized or rogue agent could lead to the chain reaction of all buttons being pushed that would result in vast majority of humanity perishing. 

Additionally, there is the potential for advanced weapons and AI consolidated in the wrong hands to lead to a total loss of freedom, privacy, and security, leading to the potential for oppressive and totalitarian control over large segments if not all of the world's population.

Lastly, the poisoning of all the waters of the earth with toxic chemicals at many times what the United States allows in its domestic drinking water supply, and the poisoning of the soils with toxic chemicals that inhibit the build up of fundamental building blocks of life, is an already-in-progress-experiment already producing vast waves of disease, and along with other forms of environmental destruction has already led to the collapse of 2/3 of the populations of many species. Continuing this experiment for another decade has the potential to see this collapse in the populations of more vulnerable species cascade up the ladder to humans. 

For a wide variety of interrelated reasons, when the four horsemen of apocalypse begin to ride together, it can easily result in suffering and death for a significant proportion of earth's inhabitants. 

Therefore, it is of paramount importance that we take immediate action to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and work towards creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The Lionsberg Strategy provides a comprehensive plan for achieving this goal, but it is only effective if we act now and make the most of this 7-year window of opportunity. If we miss this window, the potential consequences could be devastating, not only for our generation, but for many future generations as well. It is our responsibility to do everything in our power to ensure that this window is not missed and that we are able to create a better future for all. The Lionsberg Strategy is a powerful tool that can help us achieve this goal, but it requires voluntary commitment and action from the bottom up by individuals, communities, organizations, and governments around the world to make it a reality.
