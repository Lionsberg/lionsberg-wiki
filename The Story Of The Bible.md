# The Story Of The Bible

The Bible is a collection of sacred texts that tells the story of God's relationship with humanity and His plan for the world. In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth and all that is in them (Genesis 1:1). He made the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planets, and set them in the sky to serve as signs (Genesis 1:14). He created the plants and animals, and commanded them to multiply and fill the earth (Genesis 1:22). And He created humanity in His own image, and breathed His Spirit and breath into them (Genesis 2:7).

God loved His creation and longed for right relationship with it. In order to help humanity live in harmony with Him and be good stewards of His creation, God gave special instructions to humanity (Genesis 2:16-17). However, humanity ignored these instructions and fell prey to the temptation of serpent, which is associated with Satan (Genesis 3:1-7). This and subsequent "falls" resulted in inevitable consequences such as chaos, conflict, and captivity (Genesis 3:14-19). Despite this rebellion, God did not give up on humanity and continued to call out to them, offering redemption and restoration and longing to bring them back into loving right relationship (Genesis 3:15).

The struggle of humanity with God and Reality is exemplified through the history of Israel, a people who were chosen by God to be His special possession and to serve as a light to the nations (Deuteronomy 7:6-8). The name Israel, which means "those who wrestle with God," reflects this ongoing struggle to understand and follow God and His ways. Through the Old Testament, we see the story of Israel's journey, as they go through periods of faithfulness and obedience to God that lead to flourishing, as well as times of rebellion and disobedience that lead to suffering and death. In their struggle to understand and obey God's will, they receive guidance and direction through the prophets, who speak on God's behalf and reveal more of His nature and plans to the nation.

This struggle led to the progressive articulation of a set of laws and commandments that God gave to Israel to guide their life and society. These laws, which are contained in the Mosaic Covenant or Old Covenant, were formalized at Mount Sinai when God made a covenant with the Israelites, promising to be their God and for them to be His people (Exodus 19:3-8). The Mosaic Covenant contained laws and commandments that the Israelites were required to follow in order to remain in right relationship with God (Exodus 20:1-17). God promised to bless and protect the nation if they obeyed Him and upheld the covenant (Exodus 23:22-33). However, Israel often strayed from God's path and suffered the consequences of their disobedience (Jeremiah 7:23-28). Despite these challenges, God remained faithful to His covenant and continued to call out to the nation through prophetic voices, offering redemption and restoration if they would return to Him (Jeremiah 31:31-34).

God's vision for a properly ordered society and world, where peace and harmony reign, is expressed through the prophets in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word shalom, which is often translated as "peace," carries with it a deeper sense of perfect wholeness and completeness. This vision of shalom is rooted in the right relationship between God, humanity, and all creation. God's intention is for this right relationship to be reflected in every aspect of society and the world, leading to a state of flourishing for all. This vision of shalom is closely tied to the Kingdom of God or Kingdom of Heaven, a term that refers to God's reign and rule over all things. In this Kingdom, all things will flourish under the perfect intention, wisdom, knowledge, rule and authority of God (Psalm 72:8).

The history of Israel is marked by its struggles to remain in right relationship with God and understand and follow His ways (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). Despite God's guidance and grace, Israel often turned away from the One True God and worshiped other false gods (Exodus 20:3-5), leading to the corruption and decay of its social, political, religious, and economic order (Isaiah 1:4). These struggles highlighted the need for a messiah and the establishment of a New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34). The prophesies spoke of a savior or liberator who would come to reconcile humanity to God and finally establish the Kingdom of God on earth. They spoke of one who would be entirely filled with the Spirit of God (Isaiah 42:1, Matthew 3:16) and would be a just and righteous ruler (Isaiah 9:7) who would bring peace to the world (Isaiah 2:4). They also spoke of a suffering servant who would be rejected by his own people (Isaiah 53:3) and bear the sins of the world on his shoulders (Isaiah 53:5-6). Despite his suffering, he would be exalted and lifted up (Isaiah 52:13), bringing salvation to the entire world (John 3:16). Through the New Covenant, God would place His law on the minds (Jeremiah 31:33) and hearts (Jeremiah 31:33) of His people, so that the knowledge of God would be within them (Jeremiah 31:34). The prophesies indicated that when this deep internal knowledge of God covers the earth like floodwaters, the lion would lie down with the lamb, and all things would come to perfect harmony and shalom (Isaiah 11:9).

The New Covenant, annunciated by Jesus, marked a significant shift in God's relationship with humanity. According to scripture, through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, the first part of the messianic prophecies were fulfilled and the New Covenant was established (Hebrews 8:6-13). This new covenant marked a shift from being bound to strictly follow the letter of the law of the Old Covenant, to living in right relationship with God through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, who writes the Spirit of the law on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33-34) and calls and empowers us to a far higher standard. The presence and indwelling of the Spirit of God within us empowers us to live in right relationship with God (Romans 8:1-17), and liberates us from the oppressive reign of earthly, political, and priestly authority (Colossians 2:13-15). The New Covenant made clear that God’s Kingdom, love, and indwelling power were not just for the nation of Israel, but for all tribes and nations, who are all invited to become kings and priests in God’s Kingdom (Revelation 1:6, 5:10), fellow citizens and heirs with Jesus to the fullness of the Kingdom of God (Ephesians 2:19).

The Old and New Testament prophesies and the vision of Revelation make it clear that the messiah's story is not yet complete. While the first half of the messiah's story has been fulfilled, with Jesus coming as the sacrificial lamb (John 1:29), the second half is still to come (Acts 1:11). Jesus will return as the lion and the warrior king (Revelation 19:11-16), establishing the Kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10) and placing all things under the rule, authority, and knowledge of God (1 Corinthians 15:24-28). This kingdom will be without end (Isaiah 9:7). Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, while differing on their understanding of the first coming of Jesus, and look ahead to the return of the messiah, who will vanquish corruption, injustice, and oppression, and establish the Kingdom of God.

In the meantime, as we wait and long with all creation for the coming of the messiah and the revelation of the children of God (Romans 8:22), we are called to actively engage in the work of tikkun olam, or "repairing the world." This means following in the ways of God, being inspired by the Spirit of God, and transforming our lives and our world towards the image and perfection of God (2 Corinthians 3:18, Matthew 5:48). We are called to be "living stones" in the temple of God, becoming living conduits through which the Spirit, will, and intention of God can in-break and displace the corrupted old world. As we follow in the ways of God, are inspired by the Spirit of God, and look to the example of Jesus (1 John 2:6) and to the even greater things he called us to do (John 14:12), we become living conduits through which the Spirit, will, and intention of God in-breaks and displaces our corrupted old lives and old world (2 Corinthians 5:17), and transforms them into something infinitely new, better, and good. As we participate in this transformation, we become participants in the eternal work of bringing about the Kingdom of God on earth and experiencing the fullness of life, joy, purpose, and meaning that God intends for us.
