# 2.4 The Great Game's Prototype & Ideal

The Great Game of Lionsberg is founded on a Prototype & Ideal, which serves as a guiding Vision, Blueprint, and Pattern Language for players as they work together to co-create the [[New World]]. This Prototype & Ideal embodies the universal principles, values, and aspirations of the game, and offers a template for the kind of society, economy, and governance that players strive to establish through their collective efforts at the various levels of gameplay. 

Key elements of the Great Game's Prototype/Ideal include:

1.  **Sustainable and Regenerative Systems**: The Prototype/Ideal envisions a world in which all human activity operates within the [[Regenerative Boundaries]] of the Living System, nurturing and regenerating ecosystems, and promoting the health and well-being of all living beings.

4.  **Empowered and Engaged Citizens**: The Ideal fosters a culture of active citizenship, where individuals are encouraged and empowered to take responsibility for their actions, participate in decision-making processes, and contribute meaningfully to the betterment of their communities and the world.
    
5.  **Collaborative and Distributed Governance**: The Prototype & Ideal promotes a governance model based on collaboration, shared responsibility, and distributed leadership, which empowers individuals and communities to co-create solutions and drive positive change at all levels of society from the bottom up.
