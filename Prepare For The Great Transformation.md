As [[Citizens]] arise and unite to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], halt [[The Advance of The Giants]], and co-create the [[New World]], they must actively prepare for [[The Great Transformation]]. This pivotal shift encompasses personal, cultural, social, and economic changes that will result from the failure of Old Systems, as well as those which are necessary to successfully transition from a fragmented, unsustainable, and unjust world towards a reunified, regenerative, and flourishing one that works for All generations of life.

Develop contingency plans for the provision of basic supplies in the event global supply systems falter or are intentionally disrupted. 
    
9.  **Build Capacity**: Develop the skills, knowledge, and resources needed to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] and thrive in the midst of disruption and chaos, empowering individuals and communities to take meaningful action and take control of their own destinies.

11.  **Align Your Actions with the New Vision and Plan**: Align your personal and professional choices with the goals and objectives of the [[New Vision and Plan]], working to foster a more just, regenerative, and thriving world that works for All. 
    
12.  **Participate in The Great Game of Lionsberg**: Actively contribute your unique skills, knowledge, and passion to [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]], working together with fellow [[Citizens]] to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] and co-create the [[New World]].
