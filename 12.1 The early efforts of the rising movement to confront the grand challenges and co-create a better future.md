# 12.1 The early efforts of the rising movement to confront the grand challenges and co-create a better future

The rising movement, which is comprised of individuals, organizations, and communities working towards the common goal of addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future, has been taking shape in recent years. The movement is still in its early stages, but it has already begun to make a significant impact in confronting the grand challenges of our time.

One of the early efforts of the rising movement has been to raise awareness about the Meta Crisis and the need for a comprehensive and cohesive response. This has been done through various means such as social media, public speaking, and grassroots organizing. The movement has also been working to educate and empower individuals and communities to take action to address the Meta Crisis.

Another key effort of the rising movement has been to build partnerships and collaborations across sectors and disciplines. This includes working with governments, NGOs, businesses, and other organizations to co-create solutions to the Meta Crisis. The rising movement has also been fostering collaboration and partnerships within the movement itself, creating a network of like-minded individuals and organizations working towards a common goal.

The rising movement has also been working to promote sustainable and regenerative lifestyles and practices, as well as advocating for policies and regulations that promote regenerativity and well-being.

In addition, the rising movement has been working to create new models and systems, creating new forms of governance, new economic models, and new forms of community and movement building.

The rising movement is still in its early stages, but it has already begun to make a significant impact in confronting the grand challenges of our time. The movement is gaining momentum, and it is expected that it will continue to grow and evolve in the coming years as more and more people become aware of the Meta Crisis and the need for a comprehensive and cohesive response.
