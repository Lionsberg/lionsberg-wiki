# The 3 Year Lag

Our experience is that it takes about 3 years of healing, collaborating and transforming until Individuals feel fully free, empowered, and self-governing. 

The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] can be thought of in two phases: 

Phase I encompasses [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], during which All human beings will be invited by someone they know and [[Trust]] to [[Join Us]]. 

Phase II will be the 3 year period following the acceptance of [[The Invitation]] by the last person who desires to do so. 

Phase III will be the inauguration of the [[New Era]] once everyone is fully prepared and participating in Citizenship and Self-Governance in the [[New World]].
