# Lionsberg Participation Agreement (v0.1)

Welcome to Lionsberg. 

This participation agreement (the “Agreement”) outlines the terms, conditions, rights, privileges, and responsibilities associated with becoming a participant in the “**Lionsberg Community**,” an unincorporated, borderless, voluntary affiliation of people of Goodwill and cooperative intent. 

## The Purpose of Lionsberg 

The Purpose of Lionsberg is to facilitate the transformative Quest of humanity FROM the Old World TO the New World. 

We accomplish this by inspiring, connecting, and empowering humanity to work together to co-create the better future we all aspire to. 

## The Lionsberg System of Values

Lionsberg invites and supports the Participation of Citizens of Earth who resonate with the Spirit of Truth and Love, and who commit to honor and uphold the [[The Lionsberg System of Values]]. 

## Levels of Participation

Participation in Lionsberg is delineated by [[Levels of Participation]]. 

This agreement is for those progressing from observing or supporting from afar, to active participation in the Lionsberg Community. 

The purpose of Participating is to explore the potential for more meaningful participation, responsibility, and stewardship in the system as a member or citizen. 

## The Lionsberg Code of Conduct

All Participants are required to adhere to the [[Lionsberg Code of Conduct]]. 

## Transparency and Privacy 

In accordance with our commitment to [[Transparency and Accountability]], as a general rule meetings and other interactions within the Lionsberg System are recorded, and recordings are generally published.  

Making our participation, activities and progress publicly visible has a number of benefits, including building [[Groundswell]] by engaging new [[Observers]] and [[Supporters]], and building [[Trust]] through demonstrating [[Transparency]] and [[Traction]]. 

## Intellectual Property 

In the Lionsberg System, everything that is wise, right, true, and good belongs to One and All, and should be accessible to all in the commons.

To embody this, we have established a [[Lionsberg Commons]]. 

Ideas expressed in Lionsberg become part of the [[Lionsberg Commons]], and are governed by the [[Lionsberg Intellectual Content System]] and the [[Lionsberg Intellectual Property Agreement]]. 

Lionsberg does not engage in non-disclosure or similar agreements, and Participants should not express anything that they do not want to be made public and operationalized for the good of All.  

## Ideas and Opportunities 

Ideas and Opportunities that arise as a result of Participation in Lionsberg or its relationships must be pursued through new or existing ***stewardship based*** groups ***structurally federated*** with Lionsberg, and should be ***coordinated with Lionsberg*** to optimally support the emergence of the Federation and Progress along the Critical Path. 

The Lionsberg System is designed to co-operate on the basis of generating and cultivating emergent ideas and opportunities, co-creating Value, and contributing 1/10th of the Flow of Value back to the Lionsberg Federation to continuously enrich and improve the shared infrastructure, technology, community, culture, and commons. 

Dispersing energy by separating emergent energy or information from the Lionsberg Ecosystem violates the basic Design Intent, which calls for a interconnected, interexistent, and continuously improving multi-generational ecosystem and approach. 

## Collaboration and Cooperation, Not Competition

Within the Domain of Lionsberg, all Participants should collaborate and cooperate as One Body, and not compete with One Another, recognizing that what we do to each other, we do to our Selves and the Whole. 

We collaborate and co-operate "in here", so that we can effectively contend "out there" with the existential challenges, threats, and opportunities that stand in our Way.  

## Advancing Towards More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship 

Participants are encouraged to actively discern whether they resonate with the purpose, mission, vision and values of the Lionsberg Community, and advance towards [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] through the [[Lionsberg Membership Process]] if they do. 

## Withdrawal of Participation 

Participants are encouraged to withdraw their Participation and return to the Observer or Supporter level at whatever time within the 90 Day Window of Participation they decide not advance towards membership. The Lionsberg Community requests that participants who decide not to advance provide written notice to community representatives reflecting on their experience, indicating what would need to change to earn their active participation, and designating the level of relationship they desire in the future (Observer, Supporter, or removal from The List of Friends and Allies). This allows the Lionsberg Community to continuously improve the Lionsberg Experience, maintain appropriate relationship at the level the individual desires, and reach out in the future when the conditions are right. 

## Termination of Participation 

Participation in the Lionsberg Community is a privilege and not a right. All relationships in the Lionsberg Community require the ongoing voluntary consent of both parties. In the event the Lionsberg Community collectively, or its designated [[Accountability Committee]], determine the ongoing participation of an participant is not in the best interest of the community and The Goal, they reserve the right to termination the participatory relationship. This will occur if the individual fails to uphold the [[Lionsberg Code of Conduct]] and the [[The Lionsberg System of Values]], or becomes disruptive to Progress towards The Goal. 

## **Reciprocity**

Participants are requested to a make a [[Reciprocal Monthly Contribution]] that reflects the value they receive from participating. 

Participants have the responsibility to help one another create and maintain balance, flow, and reciprocity across all relationships within the System. 

## Term 

This agreement shall be valid for 90 days from the date a Lionsberg representative countersigns it. After 90 days, the participant is invited to begin the [[Lionsberg Membership Process]], or return to the level of Observer or Supporter. 

This 90 Day Window of Participation is necessary to ensure that the Community and System are concentrating Energy on those who truly want to progress and collaborate. 

## Conclusion

It is a great honor to participate together in such a worthy cause. We understand that your [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] is limited and valuable, and we are deeply grateful that you are choosing to spend the next 90 days with us.
