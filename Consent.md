# Consent

[[Consent]] is defined as the absence of [[Meaningful Objection]] to a [[Proposal]], which ensures that the Proposal, even if not perfect, Â falls within each member's [[Range of Tolerance]] as the Circle advances towards its Aim.

The closer a [[Proposal]] gets to the [[Wise Right Thing]] and alignment with the [[Fundamental Tone]] and [[Central Animating Spirit]], the more [[Harmony]] and  [[Consensus]] will be present around it. Perfect Harmony and Consensus accompanies perfect Wisdom. 

The more 'out of tune' a proposal becomes, the more dissonance will be felt, until eventually it falls out of the [[Range of Tolerance]].
