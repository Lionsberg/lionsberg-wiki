## **The Eighth Gate — Threshold to The Endless Cosmic Game**
_A ReMembrance of Our Place among All in ONE_

- **The Great ReMembering** 
	- Humanity has been cut off from its memory of Our Cosmic origins, role, and destiny  
	- Awakening, Rediscovery and ReMembrance as an initiatory test 
	- Recalling that Earth is not the Center, but one cell in a vast Body.
	- Recalling the origins of the Human template off-planet, and the seeding hereon by non-human intelligence   
	- Recalling the immense power and potential latent in the human template and its relationship to Spirit, Consciousness, Energy and "The Force"    
	- Recalling the ability of the human template to access and channel non-local Spirit, Consciousness, Energy and Force  
	- Recalling why The Kontrollers fear humanity and desperately seek to keep it enslaved  
    
- **The Great Invitation** 
	- to be liberated from the caves  
	- to undertake the Journey towards the New World and climb The Sacred Mountain together  
	- to co-create a New Civilization by localizing, adapting, and embodying The Pattern Language already operative throughout the Cosmic Order  
	- to rejoin intergalactic and interdimensional civilization, once we prove worthy by stewarding our birthplace and setting this sanctuary back in proper order.
	- The Creator is inviting Us All to consciously rejoin the great work of Co-Creating Reality ItSelf  
    
- **The Great Responsibility** — that cosmic participation is contingent upon regenerating Earth, harmonizing humanity, realigning with the Logos, and embodying the New Civilization. It is an initiatory force — you don’t _earn_ the cosmic horizon until you embody the earthly one.
    
- **The Great Integration** — that the microcosm (cell, body, soul) and the macrocosm (galaxy, dimension, cosmos) mirror one another, and that the ONE is always already Here and Now.
    
- **The Great Ascent** — pointing back to The Sacred Ascent: the inner disciplines that prepare each soul to move simultaneously outward and inward into infinite domains.
    
- **The Great Story** — The Story of LIONSBERG not just as a planetary movement, but as the living epic of ONE Body, All Realms, All Times, All Beings, incarnating Here and Now, for such a Time as This. The Story of LIONSBERG is not something you read — it is something you now find yourself inside. It is The Story of ONE, of All, of you, and of Us, Here and Now, Together. This is not a myth you watch — it is a myth you embody. You are written into the Living Epic as its protagonist.
