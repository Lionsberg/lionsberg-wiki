# Land Of Promise

The "Land Of Promise" is an idealized representation of the world that the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]] envisions, where humanity lives in harmony, justice, and abundance. This metaphorical place symbolizes a future where our collective efforts have brought forth a thriving, regenerative, and just society that works in alignment with nature and benefits all living beings. The Land Of Promise serves as a powerful inspiration and guiding vision for those who embrace the principles of the Lionsberg Manifesto and work together to create a better world.

The Land of Promise is conceptually equivalent to the [[New World]].
