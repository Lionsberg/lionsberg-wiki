# FROM -> TO

The basic idea of FROM -> TO is that we are [[Beings In Motion]]... 

FROM - [[Where We Are]]... 

TO - [[Where We Are Going]]  

Knowing [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]] is critical to avoid perishing for lack of [[Vision]]. See [[Choosing A Worthy Aim]]. 

Knowing [[Where We Are]] and [[How We Got Here]] is critical to avoid perishing for lack of [[Knowledge]].  

These two points in the [[Story]] set up the [[Navigation Issue]] that then provides a framework for how we get  FROM [[Where We Are]] TO [[Where We Are Going]].
