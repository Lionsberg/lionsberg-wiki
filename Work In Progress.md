# Work In Progress

As reflected in [[The Story of the Builder]], everything about [[LIONSBERG]] is a **Work In Progress**. 

We are discerning, designing, and building at the same time, as we labor in partnership with the [[Creator]], [[One Another]], and [[All Creation]] to co-create the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

The work to date reflects lifetimes of work from many people around the world past and present. However it likely does not reflect a unique puzzle piece you are holding! 

Expect changes, and big ones! Expect unfinished links, untied loose ends, gaps in the plans and specifications, and typos. Every aspect is a **Work In Progress**. 

For now, think of this as a joining an unfolding effort to design and build a [[City on a Hill]]. Pardon our dust, and don't forget your boots and hard hat. 

[[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]], eventually the best and most pure will emerge as the [[Dross]] is burned away. 

All that is [[Dross]] can be attributed to [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]]. 

All that is [[Wise, Right, and True]] can be attributed to [[One]], [[All]], and the emergent network of co-creators.
