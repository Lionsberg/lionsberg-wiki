# 0.3 The Moment of Decision

Now is the moment you must decide  
Whether you will enter **The Gates**  
Or turn back and hide  

If **The Warning** and **The Story** are True  
Your life and all you hold dear  
Depends on this **ONE Decision**  

Whether you **Act As If The Story is True**  
Is solely and completely up to you  

If you turn back now  
You can go back to life  
In the world you thought you were living in  

You will not have to learn about the worst realities  
Of existence for those born into systems of alien control  
You will not have consciously face the horrors of **The Caves**  
And you will be able to remain asleep within them  

You will not have to **Remember Who You Are**  
You will not have to **Heal** and **Transform**  
You will not have to make the difficult **Journey**  
Through **The Wilderness** that separates **Us**  
From experiencing the **Love** and **Belonging**  
Inherent in **Co-Creating Heaven On Earth**  

But if one day you awaken  
Enslaved in Darkness  
By a cold and pitiless force of Destruction  
Please remember that **The Decision** was yours  
And that at this very moment  
You were holding **The Key** to **Liberty**  
And made **The Decision** to turn back   

May it never be  
May it never be  
A thousand times  
MAY IT NEVER BE

And thus **The Decision** is sealed

_“O Child of Earth, are you willing to remember  
**Who You Are** and what you came here to do?”_
