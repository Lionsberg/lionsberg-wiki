# 2.3 Domains and Field of Agreement

Everything within [[LIONSBERG]] is divided up into [[SpatioTemporal Domains]], or [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]]. Each Domain has an [[Identity]], a [[Purpose]], a [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]], and is covered by a [[Field of Agreements]].  

The [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]] of each Domain can be crossed on the basis of [[Ongoing Mutual Consent]].

Every time two or three gather and [[Form A Circle]], a new Domain is brought into existence, and [[Field of Agreements]] should be formed.
