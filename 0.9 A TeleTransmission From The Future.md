# 0.9 A TeleTransmission From The Future

> "_I can show you The Future_  
> _Because We have been there_  
> _And it is Good_  

>_Enlightened Consciousness  
>Is not bound by Time or Space  
>So EveryWhen and EveryWhere  
>Are always right Here At Hand

>_Behold Our glorious Future  
>And Divine Destiny!"  

The Vision of Heaven is staggering  


>_"Now let Us return to **The Beginning**  
>And explore existence **In Between**  
>Knowing that **The Future is Good**  

>_If We ever find Our Selves in a Space and Time
>That is not Good  
>We can keep Faith  
>And rest assured  
>That it is not yet **The End** 
>Of **The Great Story**_" 

As the words "The End" are spoken  
The Vision of Heaven returns  

Then slowly  
One by One at first  
Then ten by ten  
And trillion by trillion  
The All begin enfolding  
Back into Them Selves  
Until All that remains is ONE  

As you approach **The First Gate**  
Standing alone in the **Divine Fullness**  
Of the **Cosmic Void**  
The **Golden Light** you first witnessed  
As you approached **The Threshold** returns  

As The First Gate opens  
The transcendent stillness Beyond  
The manifest heavens you just beheld  
Is terrifying beyond words 

The inscription etched  
In its Eternal Stone reads 

**_In The Beginning was the ONE_**
