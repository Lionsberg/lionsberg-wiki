# Proposal

A proposal is a suggested plan, idea, or course of action put forth by an individual or group for consideration, discussion, and possible adoption. Proposals are a crucial part of the [[Decision Making]] process, as they provide a structured way for members to present their ideas and collaborate on finding solutions.

In the context of a group or organization, proposals can be formal or informal, written or verbal, and can address a wide range of topics, from organizational structure and goals to specific projects or initiatives.

When evaluating a proposal, members should consider the following aspects:

1.  Alignment with the group's [[Aim]]: Does the proposal contribute to the progress towards the group's overarching objectives and goals?
2.  Feasibility: Is the proposal practical and achievable within the given resources, time, and context?
3.  Impact: What is the potential positive or negative effect of the proposal on the group, its members, its ability to progress towards its Aim, and the broader community or environment?
4.  Clarity: Is the proposal well-defined, easy to understand, and clearly communicated?
5. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement: How will the Proposal be broken down into [[Milestones]] and plans of action that can be monitored, evaluated, and continuously improved? 

Members should engage in constructive discussion and critique, and be open to revising or refining the proposal based on feedback, objections, and alternative suggestions. The process of deliberation should be grounded in [[Trust]], [[Openness]], and a shared commitment to the group's [[Aim]].

Once a proposal has been thoroughly discussed and refined, the group can decide whether to adopt, reject, or further modify it, using their established decision-making processes.
