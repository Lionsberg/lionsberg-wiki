# 0.4 The Threshold

This is **The Threshold** moment  
The moment where future and fate    
Join hands **Here** and **Now**  
To beckon you into  
The opportunity  
And adventure  
Of a lifetime  

**The Golden Seed**  
Will not sprout and grow  
In the dark musty soils  
Of the **Old World**  
You are about to depart  

It longs for the clean air  
And radiant high places  
The clear waters  
Vast expanses  
And magical wildernesses 
That lie **Beyond The Boundary**  

It cannot emerge and **Become**  
What it is destined to **Be**  
In the cramped and imprisoning  
Confines of the **Old Paradigm**  

It longs for **Freedom**  
For **Time** and **Space**  
To unfurl the **Divinity**  
Involved and enfolded **Within**  

And the great secret  
Is that **It** is a mirror of **you**  

You too were created and destined  
_For so much more_  

There is more within you  
Than you could ever imagine  
And it is your **Divine Destiny**  
To **Discover** and **Become**  
The fullness of **All** that is **Within**  

As you help It unfurl  
It will help you unfurl  

As you nurture It  
It will nurture you  

Each of Its transformations  
Will transform you  
And each of your transformations  
Is the essence of Its **InterBecoming**  

**The Call** has gone out  
**The Invitation** has been extended  
**The Ten Thousand Things** required  
To bring you **Here** to **This Moment**  
Unfolded in their perfectly imperfect **Way**  

Now  
**The Choice**  
Is yours and yours alone  

Above **The Threshold**  
Light streams from within  
The Ancient Living Stone  
Illuminating the Timeless words  
Through which countless  
Sovereigns and Civilizations have passed   

> _Welcome to The Kingdom of LIONSBERG_  
> _Where All who Enter_  
> _Are Sovereign and Free_
