# TKTK

TKTK is a writing convention used by authors to mark a place where additional content will be added at a later date. 

It likely originated from "to come", was shorted to TK to make it more unique, and then lengthened to TKTK to create a visually arresting and easy to spot marker. 

We use this convention in the [[Lionsberg Wiki]], which enables easy searching and immediate linking to all incomplete sections since TKTK does not appear in any actual words.
