# Superlative of Superlatives
The use of "superlatives of superlatives" is a literary device to denote the highest order of something. 

It is akin to how the word [[Meta]] is used in the [[LIONSBERG System]]. 

For instance, when describing [[ONE]] / [[God]] superlatives of superlatives such as "King of Kings", "Lord of Lords", etc. are often used. 

In the [[LIONSBERG System]] we might instead say "the Meta King" or the "Meta Lord". 

These various devices are just [[Word Tool|Word Tools]]. It is what they point to that is important.
