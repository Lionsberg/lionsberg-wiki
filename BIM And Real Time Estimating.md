# BIM And Real Time Estimating

[[Building Information Modeling (BIM)]] is an assemblage of software programs that coordinate design, estimation, and implementation of the Program.  

Architectural drawing and rendering software coordinates in 3D and 4D to assist planners, designers and contractors to determine inconsistencies and “clashes” in design.  [[Ordering and Clash Detection]]. 

It also ensures that changes in a [[Plan]] change all of the related items in other plans and budgets.  This enables the Team to avoid [Rework]] and allows r[[Real Time Estimating]] as changes to the plans and design occur.
