# 3.3 Finding Out What is Happening

As Circles and Communities form, it is recommended that each instance and locality develop a [[Local Map]] at an appropriate level of resolution. 

This could take the form of a Dispatch, or a directory of Active Circles and Active Quests. 

However a far better Way to find out [[What Is Happening]] is to talk with other humans. 

Talking with other humans is batter than solely looking at lists, because it opens up [[Dialogue]], builds relationships, helps people get to know you, and folds your wisdom, insights, and questions into the collective dialogue. 

By asking around, and sharing with others [[Who You Are]], [[Your Story]], [[Your Purpose]], [[Your Calling]], [[Your Concerns]], [[Your Capabilities]], etc., the Community will be able to help match you up to other people, opportunities, needs, and ideas in ways that a list never could. 

The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] cannot actually succeed unless We truly become a Community, and that requires acting as if that is who we are.
