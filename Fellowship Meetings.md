# Fellowship Meetings

## Roles
- Weighty Friends 
	- Wise Elders, Respected by the Community as such  
	- Humility / "Staying Low" 

## Desired Outcomes 
- Slow Down. Be Present. 
- Counter the tendency to rush towards: 
	- What might sound "right" in a rush, but not actually be the [[Wise Right]] thing. 
	- What might get us individual acclaim (because I spoke the "right" thing).  
	- What might give me power / dominion / hierarchy over others 
	- "Charismatic leader" effects of "fast" meetings 
- Engage in clearer, deeper, more emergent thinking, listening and sensing  
	- Pay special [[Attention]] to [[Weak Signals]] that would otherwise be downed out  
	- Deeply listen to anyone who has a concern / nag / intuition that a course of action or potential, if undertaken, could hinder our ability to progress towards The Goal. 
- Revelation 
	- Uncover deeper meanings, potentials, and goals  
	-  Allow higher order solutions to emerge that reconcile and resolve the concerns
- Deepen [[Right Relationship]] in Community 
- Deeply respect and value the (spirit / inner guide / spark) in each person and in our community together

## Positive Examples 
- [[Quaker Meeting]] 
- Revival Meetings, in which people are brought into synergy and alignment, and the energy is Aimed in a [[Wise Right]] Good direction 
- Rallies where energy is coalesced and then Aimed at a Good intent. 

## Negative Examples 
- Political rallies where people "rally" and synergize, and then energy is pointed towards a negative direction.

Quick notes below from [[Jordan and Peter 2022.10.31]]: 

## Quick Detour Into Neuroscience 
- Pete brought in a theory of how brains work (William Calvin's How Brains Think, etc.)
- Ringing in response to the stimulus 
- neighbors get a little of the signal from that... 
- they try to harmonize / resonate... 
- and each one has a neighbor on the other side trying to influence it to... 
- First the process of reception 
- the the conscious knowledge of an object 
- then different neurons start singing the tune of what they think it is
    - some think its a ball
    - some think its an apple 
- With the sensations coming in and neurons singing - end up with choirs of competing throughts about what we are seeing... 
- end up with clusters that have convinced themselves that it is an apple or tennis ball
- recruit more and more neighbors... 
- there is a point where it makes
- and depending strength of resonance and input coming in... then suddenly the whole thing tips and everyone agrees... 

## Quick Detour Into Bees
- Jordan's current best understanding is that this is also how bees make decisions... 
- by clustering around potential solutions and "dancing" for them
- The bees who believe the most and are dancing the loudest end up with all the others who are less "convinced" joining the one dance... 
- So it is similar resonance / emergence towards unanimous group consensus... 
- reference a book called [[Honeybee Democracy]]?
