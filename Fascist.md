# Fascist

The term "fascist" comes from the Italian word "fascismo," which is derived from "fascio," meaning "bundle", "group", or "to bind together." 

The term has its roots in the Latin word "fasces," which was a symbol of authority in ancient Rome.

Fasces were a bundle of wooden rods bound together with an axe head protruding from the center, symbolizing strength through unity. Roman magistrates and other high-ranking officials carried fasces as a symbol of their power and authority. Fascist movements, like Mussolini's, adopted this symbol to emphasize the idea that a nation or people would be stronger when united under a single, authoritative leader or party. The term "fascist" has since been used to describe similar far-right, authoritarian political ideologies and regimes.

Fascist regimes have historically tended to prioritize the interests of the state and the ruling party over individual rights, often leading to the suppression of dissent, the erosion of civil liberties, and the establishment of a single-party dictatorship. They are often characterized by [[Collusion]] at the highest level among state, economic, and media forces. 

In the context of Lionsberg, fascist forces are seen as a threat to the freedom and wellbeing of the global community, as they seek to consolidate power and impose their will on others. The Lionsberg movement aims to counteract these overly-centralizing forces and co-create a diverse, just, and [[Citizen Led]] society. 

The Lionsberg system does encourage Citizens to work together towards [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] as parts of one body, however it encourages this entirely on the basis of voluntary, bottom-up, [[Citizen Led]] action and the principles of reciprocal [[Right Relationship]], as opposed to the involuntary and top down unity imposed upon populations by fascist governments.
