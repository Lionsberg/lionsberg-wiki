# Lionsberg Currency

 Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the currency system of Lionsberg is that it should reflect the level of commitment each individual has to the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] of the [[Lionsberg Community]]. 
 
Our [[Hypothesis]] is that we should begin with a simple [[Level Of Commitment]] scale from 1 to 7, that the community revisits with each individual each month or two. 

The [[Level Of Commitment]] is a reciprocal [[Agreements|Agreement]] between each Individual and the Community, that can be adjusted over time. 

Currency can be exchanged between members of the community, or exchanged with the [[Lionsberg Central Bank]] for external fiat currency. 

If this scales out to all humanity, our entire society would operate on a 1 to 7 level of income equality, that could allow for resources and standards of living to adjusted as appropriate across all various contexts as we grapple with the currency systems of the [[Old World]]. 

The community may choose to honor the previous sacrifices and commitments of community members that helped make the community possible. 

We also ask that community members do not exchange Lionsberg Currency for external fiat currency unless they need to, as this will allow the system to spiral up far more rapidly based on virtually limitless internal currency, rather than artificially scarce external currency.
