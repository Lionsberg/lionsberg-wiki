# Lionsberg Currency

 Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the currency system of Lionsberg is that it should reflect the level of commitment each individual has to the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] of the [[Lionsberg Community]], and the Value created in service of our overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 
 
Our [[Hypothesis]] is that we should begin with a simple [[Level Of Commitment]] scale from 1 to 7 (or 10), that the community revisits with each individual each month or two. 

The [[Level Of Commitment]] is a reciprocal [[Agreements|Agreement]] between each Individual and the Community, that can be adjusted over time. 

Currency can be exchanged between members of the community. Eventually, it may be able to be exchanged with the [[Lionsberg Central Bank]] for external fiat currency. 

Lionsberg currency has been provisionally named [[Lionsberg Units of Value (LUV)]].
