# Lionsberg Currency

 Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the emergent currency system of Lionsberg is that it should reflect the level of commitment and [[Value Creation]] of each individual, relative to [[The Goal]] that unites us.  

The ultimate design calls for transcending the existing fiat and accounting paradigms into a new [[Time-Energy Accounting]] system that measures [[Value Creation]] relative to [[The Goal]] of the [[New Human Operating System]]. 

Our [[Hypothesis]] is that in the near term, we should begin with a simple [[Level Of Commitment]] scale from 1 to 10, that the community revisits with each individual each month or two. 

The [[Level Of Commitment]] is a reciprocal [[Agreements|Agreement]] between each Individual and the [[Groups]] or [[Teams]] they are a part of, that can be adjusted over time. 

Currency can be exchanged between members of the community. Eventually, it may be able to be exchanged with the [[Lionsberg Central Bank]] for external fiat currency. 

Lionsberg currency has been provisionally named [[Lionsberg Units of Value (LUV)]].
