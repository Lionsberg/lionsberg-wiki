# The Plan

The Plan is shorthand for our [[Current Best Understanding]] of [[How]] we are going to [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

It will eventually be fully articulated in the [[System Wide Master Plan]]. 

In summary, The Plan is to connect up and empower one billion small groups of 3 to 20 people, effectively encompassing all of humanity, so that we can coordinate and align our [[Individual And Local]] [[Progress]] towards our [[Universal Goals and Values]].
