# Energy and Commitment Based UBI

Energy and Commitment Based UBI (short for Universal Basic Income), is the basis of the [[Lionsberg Currency]].  

It starts with the abundant [[Daily Income]] of [[Energy]] from the [[Sun]] and [[Universe]], which powers [[Life]], [[Economy]], and [[Society]]. 

It recognizes the entry of [[Energy]] into [[Earth]] as the beginning of local and cyclical [[Time-Energy Accounting]], and allocates to each human being an equal baseline amount.  

It measures relative commitment on a scale of 1 to 7 as a proxy for human [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]]. 

It also linguistically and technically relates to the [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] that accomplishes the [[Work]] represented by the [[Network of Commitments]], the [[Progressive Realization]] of which produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].  

The key to UBI is ensuring that as a Community we are Progressing towards our Goals and Objectives. 

If someone is "contributing a lot", but not actually advancing the Goals and Objectives, it is actually [[Waste]] that hinders the ability of the [[Lionsberg System]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].  

It would technically, economically and environmentally be far wiser to pay such "contributors" to cease. 

[[Level Of Commitment]] is a qualitative and human negotiation between each individual and the Groups they participate in.

It is anticipated that the combination of [[Time-Energy Accounting]], AI, Robotics, and the conversion of our [[High Science Technology]] [[FROM Weaponry TO Livingry]] will render the notion of "money" obsolete.  

We will soon discover that [[We Are All Billionaires]].
