## 2026-01-18 - Initial Claude Code Setup & Project Plan

**Session Summary:**
First working session with Claude Code. Established repository guidance, transformed README.md for maximum resonance with The First Three Percent, and expanded the shower epiphany into a comprehensive project plan for making The Great Game computationally playable.

**Accomplished:**
- Created [[CLAUDE]] with comprehensive mission context and repository guidance
- Transformed [[README]] from 35% to 93% resonance with awakening population
- Documented git workflow in plain English in [[English Language Git]]
- Added comprehensive section on git tags (critical for milestones)
- Created [[How to Use Claude Code]] for terminal mode usage
- Expanded [[A Program to Play The Great Game]] from initial epiphany into complete three-phase project plan
- Updated [[TKTK Program Notes]] with new project references
- Tagged milestone: "after-initial-claude-onboarding"

**Key Decisions:**
- **90%+ resonance** established as primary metric for The First Three Percent
- **Voice standards**: Definitive not tentative, active verbs, urgent without fear
- **Timeline clarity**: We are IN year 2 of 7-year window (2024-2030), ~4 years remaining
- **Markdown rendering**: Two-space line endings required for proper flowing text
- **MWB clarification**: CI/CD only, not run locally
- **CLAUDE.md placement**: Keep at root level (strategic), not in Claude Code/ (tactical)

**Files Created:**
- [[CLAUDE]] - Primary guidance for future Claude instances
- [[How to Use Claude Code]] - Terminal mode usage guide
- [[English Language Git]] - Plain-English git explanation
- [[Longterm Project - Fixing Broken Links]] - Systematic wiki maintenance plan
- [[A Program to Play The Great Game]] - Comprehensive computational reflection project plan
- [[Work Log]] - This file

**Files Modified:**
- [[README]] - Complete transformation to Gates of LIONSBERG
- [[TKTK Program Notes]] - Added new project references

**User Teaching Moments:**
1. MWB is CI/CD only, not run locally
2. Two-space line endings for markdown rendering
3. Voice: "collapsing" not "ending", "it is" not "likely"
4. Timeline: We're IN the window, not preparing for it
5. Git tags must be explicitly pushed with `git push --tags`
6. "Gather a Small Circle" should be FIRST step in README
7. Use [[wiki links]] for ALL internal references, including file lists - not markdown links or file paths

**Insights:**
- The 2.5M word corpus is a "latent program" that can be reflected mathematically/computationally
- Semantic field ↔ Computational models ↔ Real-world play creates triple helix of mutual clarification
- The Golden Seed is complete and ready, not draft status
- Fibonacci pattern (1→2→3→5→8→13→144) reflects natural awakening spread
- The 300 is archetypal role in every community of 10,000

**Git Tags:**
- `after-initial-claude-onboarding` - Milestone marking completion of initial setup

**Next Session Considerations:**
- Begin generating essential plays for [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]] (A Item in program notes)
- Consider Phase 1 prototyping for computational reflection project (semantic analysis, pattern extraction)
- Coordinate [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] with other narrative documents
- Address frequently asked questions by creating new Plays

**Session End Status:**
All work committed and pushed. Repository in clean state. Work log established for continuity.
