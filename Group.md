# Group

The term "Group" in the context of the Lionsberg System refers to a collection of Participants who are working together towards a specific goal or objective that is aligned with the shared Vision, Goals, and Values of the system.

Groups in the Lionsberg System can take many forms, including cross-functional teams, project teams, communities of practice, and more. They may be comprised of Participants from different organizations, backgrounds, and perspectives, and may be focused on delivering specific projects, initiatives, or outcomes that advance the collective progress towards the shared Vision.

Groups in the Lionsberg System are expected to work in a highly collaborative and adaptive way, using the Lionsberg System's guidelines and best practices for vision, analysis, planning, execution, and continuous improvement. They are also expected to engage in regular analysis and reflection, and to continuously improve their own practices and processes to better align with the shared Vision and Goals.

The Lionsberg System provides Groups with the tools, resources, and guidance they need to work together effectively towards their specific goals and objectives.
