# The Function Of Governance

In the context of a Mythical Story about a global community that awakened, arose, and united to meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities inherent in this moment in the Story...

...what is the Function of Governance? 

The function of a Governance System is to Navigate the Vessel towards its Destiny / Goal.  

The word “Govern” derives from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. 

It begs the question: 

_How do we collectively navigate our Vessel towards The Goal?_  

The Function of Governance, having fixed our [[Aim]], is to [[Navigate]] FROM [[Where We Are]] TO [[Where We Are Going]].  

This requires establishing comprehensive structure, culture and process that is protective and purposeful, and accomplishes what is needed given the social, economic, and political nature of the mission and goal. 

The Governance Infrastructure must be simultaneously simple and understandable enough that it can be participated in by All and robust enough to protect the System against all forms of co-option or erosion by internal or external forces, while promoting transparency and accountability by, among, and between all members of the Community.
