# Meta Condition of Satisfaction
The **Meta Condition of Satisfaction** is that whatever we co-create has to measurably and progressively accomplish the overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. If it does not, the [[New]] task has not been designed and built properly, and should be rejected by the global Community. 

This Meta Condition contains within itself and orders all other [[Conditions of Satisfaction]].
