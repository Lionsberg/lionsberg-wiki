# Mondragon Overview

[[Lionsberg]] is working to create a [[New]] Operating System for Humanity that enables a [[New]] [[Way of Being]] that balances all economic, social, political, spiritual, and environmental pillars. 

One example of an instantiation of such a Model is [[Mondragon]]. 

The numbers change continually, but at the time of visiting Mondragon consisted of a federation or [[Cooperative Of Cooperatives]] spanning: 

- 102 Cooperatives  
- 140 Subsidiaries  
- 26 Umbrella Companies and Foundations
- = 268 Total Organizations 

- ~70,000 cooperative members 

## Massive Transformative Purpose 
- All purpose and goals must align up to One 
- A new technology for organizing and aligning my Vision and Purpose, with the Highest Vision and Purpose 

## Mission 
- Transformed every 4 years around the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of entrepreneurial development and job creation  

## Everything A Tool / Process / Pattern 
- A co-op is a tool 
- To accomplish the Goal of what? Human and social development. 

## Entrepreneurial Spirit
- Team based entrepreneurship 
- What is the right reward for entrepreneurs? Social honor? Status?  
- Who owns the idea and work and good fortune that rises on top of such a society? 

## Core Enterprise / Headquarters 

Serving 268 Organizations and ~70,000 members was a small "federal" headquarters, with only about 60 members. 

## Self Governance 

The relatively tiny size of the federal service, communications, and coordination hub was made possible by the fact that all cooperatives in the system are [[Self Governing]] and [[Independent]] of the the federal government.

## Big Ideas 

### 1. Dignity of the Human Person 


### 2. Solidarity 



### 3. Work 

[[Meaningful Work]] is the positive [[Way]] we develop our [[Selves]] and our [[Society]]. 

In [[Mondragon]], the elders say _"We are going to help God finish our world."_ 

[[Work]] is not a curse, but a primary source of [[Purpose]] and [[Meaning]]. 

### 4. Education 

[[Arizmendi]] believed that education, along with meaningful work, were the core elements that transformed human beings. 

In Mondragon, [[Sirimiri]] is a [[Word Tool]] they use to point to a light little rain. [[Arizmendi]] used this as a metaphor for teaching, and would give little [[Fireside Chats]]. A little rain, a little enlightenment at a time, recognizing that the seeds of Wisdom and Knowledge take many years to grow.

## Consulting Co-Ops 

## Inception 
- 1936 to 1939 - Civil War 
- In 1943, he raised money from the local townspeople to start a [[School]]. 
- Convinced 11 local students to study engineering via correspondence, visiting [[Arizmendi]] to take the exams. 
- [[Arizmendi]] spent 10 years speaking and giving conferences. People agreed with the ideas, but no one changed. Bad strategy. 
- Conclusion: It is not possible to transform the [[Old]] companies. We need to create our own [[New]] companies. 
- 1956 - Convinced 5 guys to quit and start the first [[Cooperative]] - ULGOR. 
- 1959 - Started the [[Bank]] 
- 1976 - Introduced Humanities Department to University 
- 1991 - shifted from regional to industry organization structure 
- 2011 - Introduced Gastronomy Department to University 
- 2016 - Revived Regional organizational structure (in addition to Industry) in order to fuel [[Social Innovation]] 

## Government Relations
- Over time have lobbied government repeatedly to change laws to allow for easier operations and compliance 

## Governance Structure 
- General Assembly 
	- Elected by Members 
	- Most important annual decisions 
	- 4 year terms 
	- 2 representatives from the smallest co-op, then graduated up according to size
	- [[Standing Committee]] - including [[President]] 
- Governing Council 
	- Elected by General Assembly 
	- Given training on Management  
	- 3 year terms 
	- Responsible for appointing the General Manager 
- General Manager 
	- Nominates the Management Council 
	- Every 2 years, Governing Council "renews trust" in GM 
- Management Council 
	- Includes a Director for each Functional Department 
- Social Council 
	- Communication Body 
	- 1 to 2 year terms 
	- At all fractal levels down to every department 
	- Have 2 meetings per month
		- One meeting with Management Council and General Manager 
		- One meeting with their department 
			- Explain to their colleagues the [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]] of the organization 
			- Discover questions, problems, needs, opportunities 
			- Relay answers to inquiries from previous month 
	- Mandatory to serve if you are elected, no additional compensation for the extra service 
- Consent 
	- Key decisions must be anonymous. 
	- Slow down and wait for the higher order solution to emerge, which reconciles all the apparently competing concerns 
	- If you vote and it is 5-4, or 8-1, maybe that minority is sensing something that is genuinely wrong and will block progress  
- No [[Campaigning]] 
	- If you say "vote for me", you are essentially automatically excluded from the contest 
- 1/2 the ballot renewed every 2 years 
	- Governing Council proposes candidates to members 
	- Or - members select and unify around candidates  

## Corporate Structure 
- 1st Degree Cooperatives - 
	- 102 Cooperatives 
	- Divided into 14 Divisions 
- 2nd Degree Cooperatives - "Industry Areas"
	- Divisions are like 2nd degree cooperatives 
	- The General Manager of the 2nd Degree Co-Op is VP of Division  
	- Every few years, the divisions rebalance 

## Step 1: Restructuring Results 
- 15% to 40% of results are spread between the divisions... 
- So that everyone "feels" gains and losses across the Whole 

## Step 2: Capital Allocation - Profitable Co-Ops
- 14% to MCC 
- 10% to expand the System and create new jobs (Via Management Co)
- 2% to help struggling co-ops (Via Foundations and subsidies)
- 2% to help non-profit co-ops (Via Foundations and subsidies)

## Step 3: Taxes

## Step 4: Net Profits 
- 10% - lifting up society, education 
- 30% - worker profit sharing 
- 60% - reserves and growth 

## Functional Areas and Shared Services 
- "Social Management" - there are no [[Human Resources]] 
- General Purchasing Department - can join if you want, no obligation 
- Incubators and Labs 
	- Saiolan - business incubator for tech 
	- 16 companies / year  
	- Most incubated businesses are not co-operatives because _entrepreneurs don't want to give away_ (wrong understanding / cultural breakdown) 
	- Some university teachers work a few hours a month for Saiolan incubator 
- Central R&D to partner with each Co-Op
- Central service units also service outside organizations, not just Mondragon organizations 
- No obligation to use internal service units
	- Culturally encouraged, but no obligation. Internal service units have to perform. 
	- Small and medium co-ops tend to use more 
	- Larger co-ops tend to develop their own 
- Social Safety Nets 
	- Private Social Security
		- Up to 2 years if not working  
- R&D and other central services are also independent co-ops 
	- Must  market, contract, and ask for projects internally and externally 
	- Generate revenue internally and externally 
- Elkar-Lan 
	- 2nd degree cooperative whose mission is to promote cooperative employment 
	- Mostly very small coops of 2 to 4 people 
- Mondragon central looking to create co-ops that can employ 100s 
- Laboral Kutxa (which might be the bank)? has 20 person service to create companies 
- Gaztenpresa foundation 
	- in 2017 402 companies, only 700 emplooyees 
	- Cultivating the entrepreneurial gene 

## Innovation 
- Central R&D to partner with all businesses and cross-pollinate solutions 
- M4 Future Innovation Model - on web page 
- "The R&D department of each co-op is the most important" 
	- Each co-op has an innovation and technology center 
- Innovation is in our DNA, starting with our cooperative structure 
- Renew facilities, buy new machines, never rest or become complacent or arrogant 
- Missions to other industries and other parts of the world to see what they are doing 
- There is always one more step to be done. The moment you become satisfied, it is the beginning of the end 

### Changes in AI, Robotics, Automation 
- Even in 2018, were beginning to progressively discover that most jew were for those with advanced [[Vocational Training Or Better]] 
- Disruptive technology is coming - 20% to 40% of jobs will disappear 
- Estimating that 20% to 40% of the population would soon be unable to participate in the economy 
- By 2030 to 2035 most low to mid skill jobs gone 
- "Can't pay 25x the wages in other countries and still be competitive"
- What is next wave of work for students and blue collar with coming wave of automation and robotics? 
- How to deal with increasing globalization and the dramatic wage and productions disparities 
- Innovation and education are the key 

### Big Bets
- Of the 10% that goes to Mondragon to expand the system and create new jobs... 
	- ~80% to infrastructure and technology improvements, job creation 
	- ~ 20% goes towards subsidies and the big bets / moonshots 
- Pooling central capital and de-risking / incentivizing moonshot projects that may provide a future for citizens 

## Challenges
- Smart cities 
- Manufacturing 4.0 - automated, back in country 
- Big data 
- AI 
- Raw Materials 
	- Future is less weight 

## Powerful Help, With No Guarantees  
- MCC can help, but guarantees nothing among the independent co-ops
- Every co-op is self-governing and responsible for its own sustainability and success 
- Sovereign autonomous co-operatives with no guarantees 
- Very important that both culturally and legally there is no perceived claim on the Whole 
- MCC usually helps with a stage 1 restructuring, no obligation beyond 
- Ensure relationship between the [[Core Enterprise]] and the distributed network is arms length to protect against Black Swans / Titanic events taking down the Whole 
- 

## Sovereignty and Autonomy 
- No one is here to save you. You are the first Agent. 
- The boss is not responsible, you are 
- The federation is not responsible, you are 
- The federation and the leaders are there to serve and coordinate the autonomy and responsibility of the distributed network 
- Like a federation of City States 
- At Team / Local Level 
	- Empowering those experiencing issues to propose and implement solutions that lift up the team, therefore the co-operative, therefore society, therefore the whole living system

### Worker Replacement 
- If you are moved to another co-op, placed back on temporary contract for ~1 year while remaining a member of the old co-op for a year. 
- If it is a good fit, you become a member in the new co-op and your capital moves 
- If the old co-op is bankrupt, Mondragon puts in the 15k euros to restart your capital account with the new co-op

### Financial Crises
- Example - bankruptcy of Fagor, largest co-op 
- Lenders and Social Security made whole first, worker / member / owners last 
- Lessons
	- Stop losses sooner 
	- Hope is often the last thing we lose 
	- Face Reality early and often 

### Co-Operate Internally, Compete Externally 
- internal co-operation not competition 

### Reporting, Audits, Checks and Balances 
- Regular reporting to MCC Headquarters 
- Annual audits 
- Checks and Balances 
-  Close Attention and Disciplined Management 



## What Did Not Work 
- [[Arizmendi]] spent 10 years speaking and giving conferences. People agreed with the ideas, but no one changed. Bad strategy. 

## Mondragon Learnings 
- [[Fireside Chats]] - [[Sirimiri]]  
- Don't transform the [[Old]], [[Co-Create]] the [[New]] 
- Need for an internal [[Bank]] 
- Mondragon Experience - Not Mondragon Model 
- Internal co-operation, not competition 
- Education was the foundation of Mondragon 
- Community organizing, social organizing, education of both children and adults 
- "Organize a group to do something - elect two coordinators, and I'll be back to check on you" ~ [[Arizmendi]] (approx)
- Individual and Community Projects 
- Basque - premier linguistic mystery. Not discernibly related to any other language. 

## Applied Values 
- If values are not applied and embodied, we don't really have them  
	- The radical separation of the values discussed on Sunday and verbally assented to, and those embodied and lived out during the week 
- What form of business and self-governance enables us to translate these values into work and society and life with integrity? 
- Applied value clash with pop-culture values of consumption, leisure, whim, short term... vs. traditional co-op values... 

## Mondragon Sayings
- We are going to help [[God]] finish our world. 
- [[Work]] begets [[Virtue]]. [[Virtue]] begets [[Honor]]. 
- Worker = Member = Owner. 
- What is on our minds is the Mission: [[A Better Society]] (through empowered work and education). 
- If we believe in democracy and self-governance, shouldn't that also be applied to economics? 
- Living and working for God and humanity 

## Concepts 

### How to Transform the World

The core idea is the transformation of the world from the bottom up. To do that, you have to create [[New People]]. 

Transformed People -> Transformed Society. 

The primary way to elevate and transform humanity is through meaningful work and enlightening education. 

Economic, Social, and Personal development in service to humanity 

### Catholic Religion 

Mondragon is not a Catholic organization, however [[Arizmendi]] was a priest and placed a spiritual foundation underneath all that was built. 


### Three Elements Present Throughout Inception 

#### 1. Daily Church / Religion 

#### 2. Technical School / Vocational Training / Work 

#### 3. Social and Cultural Action 

 - Free time organizations 
- Music, plays, parades, lotteries to raise money for the poor, debates, football clubs 
- The social activity often engaged the youth, whose parents were fighting and divided 
- Cultural events, carnival etc. 
- Frequent cultural activities for the youth 

### Blend of For-Profit and Social Organizations 
- It is seen as part of the responsibility of the economic engine to fund the valuable social goods 
- Some of the organizations generate economic resources, others generate social riches so that everyone can live decent lives  

## Community Based Sense Making 
- [[Where Are We?]]
- [[Where Are We Going?]] / Where do we want to go
- How do we get there? 
- What do we all think the problems are? 

## Coordinating Resources and Philanthropy 

- If we have $250,000, what are we going to do with it and why? 

### Escaping Dependency and Paternalism 

Previously the work in the community outside sustenance was dominated by rich industrialists, who provided some basic services for the workers. 

### Team Based Entrepreneurship

- Team based intrapreneurship vs. individual / hero entrepreneurship 
- The critical path is to prepare teams of intrapreneurs for the cause 
- We don't teach them, we help them learn 

### Worker = Member = Owner 
- In the beginning: 100%  
- Present: 85% Worker / Member / Owners, 15% Temp Contracts 
- No unions vs. management - fully self-governing from the bottom up based on cooperating rather than internal division 

### Intern / Apprentice -> Temp Contract -> Member 
- Train. If hard worker and good cultural fit, then award a 90 day trial. 
- 90 day trial -> 2-3 year Temp Contract. 
- After 2-3 years, either: 
	- Membership is offered 
	- Contract is terminated 
- Learning - this facilitates the churn that is needed to create space for those who truly have the heart and desire to become contributing members of Society. 

### Commitment / Buy In / Skin In The Game
- Everyone buys in - ~ $15,000 Euros 
	- Loans are available from the bank so there is no barrier to entry 
	- 20% is fee 
	- 80% is your [[Initial Capital]] 
- Skin in the game is critical, but should not be a barrier to entry 
	- Resource ladders need to be in place so that everyone has access 

### Profit Sharing
- We share 30% of profits among us. 
	- If you are a temp worker, it is cash. 
	- If you are a member, it is [[Capital]]. 
- Often 3 to 6 weeks pay average profit sharing 

### Capital 
- Capital is not available for withdraw until you finish working, so that it stays in [[Flow]] in the [[System]]. 
- If you so choose, you can leave [[Capital]] in when you [[Retirement|Retire]]. 

### Return On Capital 
- [[General Assembly]] decides if they pay interest each year, and at what rate. 
- Range from 0 to 7.5%. 

### Allocation Of Capital 
- Minimum 10% for society 
- 30% for [[Profit Sharing]] 
- Balance ~ 60% for [[Capital Reserves]]  

### Use Of Capital 
- Work to improve our [[Selves]]
- Work to improve our [[Society]]  
- Help God finish our [[World]] 

### Inter-Cooperative Loans 
- Keep Capital in [[Flow]] 
- Low interest rates, backed by Mondragon federation 

### Ration of Highest to Lowest Paid  
- Spanish IBEX companies ~ 1:100 
- United States ~ 1:330  
- Mondragon ~ 1:7
	- Each level has decimals
	- Each position has a range written in the handbook, for instance 1.9 to 2.1 

### Performance Management
- Review every 2 years 
- Very rare to fire 

### Minimum Wage
- Minimum Wage is about 1.5x what the government mandates (~15,000 euros vs. ~10,000 euros)

### Advance Payments, Not Guaranteed Salaries  
- We are all Owner / Stewards, therefore there is no "them" to guarantee [[Salaries]] 
- [[Salaries]] are an [[Advance Payments]] on final accounting 
- If what we pay our Selves results in a loss, it comes out of our [[Capital Accounts]] 

### Performance Management 

### Process, Technology, and Best Practice Cross Pollination
- Processes, technology, and best practices cross-pollinated between co-ops. 

### Self-Governance 
- 1 Member = 1 Vote 
- Every Member has the [[Right To Elect]], and the [[Right To Be Elected]]. 

### Self-Determination 
- Effort, Work, Sacrifice - reaping the fruit of your labor 

### Trust But Verify
- Annual external audits 

### Symbols
- Easy to understand internationally and in youth 
- Flags / Pins 


### Solving Issues 

Identify problems, propose solutions, implement, learn. 

### Developing Countries 
- Opportunity be paid to work on developing countries projects 
- Long term commitments 10 years plus to facilitate true learning, relationship, and transformation 
- Idea competition for interest free micro loans 
- Mozambique 
	- co-op idea didn't work 
	- Farmers had other [[Needs]]  
	- Like a roadway. Basic infrastructure. 
- Everything done on the basis of [[Micro Finance]]  
- Need someone on the ground to truly learn and understand 
- Technical expertise help 
- start small and learn 

### Program Management
- Program Management function required to coordinate
	- Universities 
	- NGos
	- Co-ops
	- volunteers / retirees 

## Thinking
- [[Thinking]]
- In [[Scales And Probabilities]] not [[Black And White]], yes or no 
- [[Triangulating To The Wise Right Answer]]

## Actions Not Words
- If you use the words and terms, people think it is propaganda and shut it off 
- Demonstrate with action, live it out, then back it up with the principles and concepts 

## The Gap Between Who We Are And The Ideal 
- There is ALWAYS a gap between [[Who We Are]] and the [[Ideal]] / [[Principles]] / [[Values]] we uphold. 
- "But at least there is a standard, and we hope there is less of a gap than with other organizations"  
- Striving to [[Co-Create]] practical Realities that conform ever more closely to the Foundational [[Ideal]] / [[Principles]] / [[Values]]  
- Evolution and bottom up transformation towards the [[Ideal]] - as opposed to revolution from the top down that leaves the social fabric of humanity fundamentally unchanged 
- It is not perfect. It is not a utopia. It is not a finished model. 
	- It is PROCESS for RISING towards unachievable perfection 
	- Aided by the Grace of God 

## Acting As If
- Foundations and other entities that are not technically organized as non-profits still [[Act As If]]  
- 

## Experience and Continuous Improvement
- It is not heaven. It is not utopia. We are human, we are trying to figure it out, and therefore it is imperfect. 
- But we are striving to make it more perfect by getting a little better every day  


### Local Sustainable Agriculture 
- Local, organic, sustainable agriculture  

## Reflections On What Is Not Working
- Co-Ops Sold
	- Barcelona co-op sold out to a great offer from Cemex... everyone walked away with millions. 
	- The temptation of short term local gain at the expense of the Whole 
- Co-Ops Bankrupt 
	- After Fagor backruptcy, 1,900 employees demonstrated against Mondragon and sued 
- Culture 
	- Something went wrong in the training that allowed for this. 
	- Need to rethink, and reinforce with every speech that YOU are responsible first. 
	- You are the first agent 
- Welfare State 
	- In the beginning, there was no welfare state 
	- The Priest said: Ask not what Society can do for you , but what you can do for Society 
	- Now, we are starting to live in an entitled welfare state 
- Lack of coordinated strategy and reporting for how non-profit $ is spent 
- Training must begin from youth, and be hit hard and immediately when a worker begin 
	- Year zero / onboarding 
	- Year one 
	- Year two 
	- Then ongoing maintenance 
- General Assembly Meetings have become very short
	- Many people, and debate is unusual 
	- When they ask if there are any issues or objections, usually silence 
	- Are issues and minority vote going unseen? 
- Blame
	- If the problem is ever outside the Conscious Agent, you will never improve... 
	- If something goes wrong, it is us that must transform 
	- If something is not hear, it is because we were not persuasive, passionate, convincing, etc.
