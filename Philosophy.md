# Philosophy
The Love of Wisdom. 

The Systematized study of the [[Deepest]] and most Fundamental things, such as the fundamental nature of existence and reality, and the translation of the total set of Wisdom derived from such study into a unified [[System]] of thought. 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] is striving towards a coherent and unified Philosophy, rooted fundamentally in Right Relationship to [[ONE]], [[All]] and the [[Logos]] of the universe.
