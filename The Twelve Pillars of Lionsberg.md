# The Twelve Pillars of Lionsberg

If all generations of life and consciousness are to develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony, a Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues and Goals logically present themselves. 

How shall we govern our Selves in accordance with Divine Principles? How shall we nurture lifelong learning that imparts not just knowledge but wisdom? How shall we heal and maintain our Selves in a state of wholeness that reflects Divine Integrity? How shall we eradicate corruption and manifest justice as a tangible reality? How shall we ensure that our basic needs—clothing, shelter, food—are met in a manner that respects the Creator's bounty? And how shall we steward our planet in a way that recognizes its sacredness and nurtures its regenerative capacities?

From the Supreme Foundation of the Creator's Intent arise The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg. Far from being mere policy proposals, these pillars serve as a Work Breakdown Structure to empower individuals, families, organizations, and communities around the world to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild their worlds. Logically derived from the Uniting Creator's Intent, these spiritual imperatives seek to manifest the qualities and mandates of the New Covenant in their real-world applications. They are as follows:

1. **Spiritual and Philosophical Flourishing**: A call to foster a vibrant spiritual landscape where shared Vision, Values, and Codes of Wisdom guide our individual and collective actions, aligning them with the Divine Purpose and Plan.
    
2. **Self Governance and Civic Engagement**: An urgent call to reconstruct our social and political institutions under the mandate of Divine Sovereign Citizenship. Transparency, accountability, and participation aren't just procedural necessities but sacred tenets to foster a united front in fulfilling the Divine Mandate on Earth.
    
3. **Economic Justice and Transformation**: A directive to establish economic systems that reflect the Divine Principles of justice and abundance, championing the dignity of all beings and empowering every family, community, and ecosystem to flourish materially in social and ecological balance.
    
4. **Holistic Education and Lifelong Learning**: A mission to create New frameworks of lifelong learning and education that recognize the Divine Potential in every child and Citizen, and reposition teachers and technologies as guides to aid in the transformative journey of each individual and community towards their Destiny and Potential.
    
5. **Holistic Health and Integrated Wellness**: An invitation to adopt  paradigms of integrated spiritual, intellectual, emotional, physical, and environmental wellbeing that view the individual as a holistic entity that must flourish in harmony with family, community and nature.
    
6. **Regenerative Agriculture and Supply Chains**: A mandate to engage in agricultural practices and supply chain management that respect the sanctity of the Earth and its ecosystems as a Living System, while fostering bioregional and local strength, integrity, and resiliency.
    
7. **Abundant Clean Energy**: A charge to responsibly transition to regenerative energy models that honor the Creator's gifts of natural resources, while providing abundantly for all and prioritizing the upliftment of the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized.
    
8. **Artistic and Cultural Enrichment**: An encouragement to celebrate and cultivate culture and the arts as expressions of Divine Creativity, integral to human development, social coherence, and progressive enlightenment.
    
9. **Inspiring Built Environment**: A call to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild our built environments towards reflecting Nature and the Divine Order, co-creating spaces that are not just functional but spiritually uplifting, reflecting the beauty and harmony inherent in Creation, and integrating natural and built environments into a seamless Whole.
    
10. **Peace, Security, Strength, and Social Harmony**: A command to vanquish chaos, disorder, and oppression, to establish social systems that prioritize Divine Order, restorative justice, ethical governance, and to secure the liberty and security of individuals and localities by making them strong and united. 
    
11. **Scientific and Technological Wisdom**: A challenge to elevate science and technology from mere mechanisms to tools towards sacred alignment and service of the Highest Intention and Greatest Good, infusing ethics, consciousness, intention, and Wisdom into the fabric of research, discovery, and innovation. 
    
12. **Environmental Stewardship and Regenerativity**: A divine imperative to act as wise stewards of the Earth, engaging in practices that regenerate and restore our bioregions and our planet to a state of flourishing, diversity, and abundance.
