# 3.2 Cultural Norms and Expectations

All of Us here on [[The Path]] are committed to co-operating in a Spirit of Love and [[Doing Our Best]] to [[Help And Not Harm]] One Another. 

In general the expectation is that we all do our best to become the best players / practitioners / teammates / citizens / community members we are capable of becoming, while upholding [[The LIONSBERG System of Values]].  

As we look over the millennia towards the horizon of destiny, it is the Culture, Processes, Norms, and Values that persist, not the individuals, projects, or teams that come and go in every season and every generation. 

[[Culture]], the Way we do things around here as a human species, trumps everything. It became the [[Root Cause]] of the [[Meta Crisis]] in the [[Old World]], and it is The Key to [[Heaven On Earth]].
