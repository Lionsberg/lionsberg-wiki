# Agreements

This page is a [[Work In Progress]]

**Agreements** are an essential aspect of collaboration within the Lionsberg Community. They help establish clear expectations, roles, and responsibilities for all involved parties, and play a significant role is establishing and maintaining [[Right Relationship]]. 

This page provides a collection of agreement templates that can be used to guide and support various types of collaborations within the Lionsberg ecosystem. These templates are designed to be fractally consistent, allowing individuals to become comfortable using them across different contexts and situations.

The Agreements herein map to various [[Levels of Abstraction]], enabling them to be stacked up and aligned across all levels of being and doing. 

## The Meta Agreement 

The first spiritual and moral imperative is to define and live a life of integrity and [[Right Relationship]] to [[ONE]] and [[All]], to the [[Creator]] and [[Creation]], to the [[Source]] of Life and the [[River of Life]].

## Integrated Delivery Agreements  

Eventually, the [[LIONSBERG Integrated Delivery System]] aims to build towards integrated delivery of [[The Goal]] across the [[Group Of Groups]]. 

Integrated Delivery agreements routinely include the following elements: 

 1. A legal relationship  
 2. A legal structure 
 3. A management committee
 4. An incentive pool
 5. A no-blame working environment
 6. Design assistance from the entire team  
 7. Collaboration software  
 8. Lean delivery elements    
 9. Defined Leadership, authority, and responsibility 

We will get there soon. For now, we are becoming aware of one another, connecting, and developing skill in organizing and federating.
