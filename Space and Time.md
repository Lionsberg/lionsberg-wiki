# Space and Time

[[Space and Time]], or [[SpaceTime]], refers to both to our our perceptions of space and time, and to the mathematical models that combine three dimensions of space and one dimension of time into a perceptual four-dimensional manifold. 

It is critical to understand that our perceived [[SpaceTime]], and the associated mathematical models, are _not fundamental_, and that additional dimensions exist. 

One can intuitively think of [[SpaceTime]] as a simplified **user interface** that we use to interact with the fundamental underlying [[Reality]] — see [[Spacetime User Interface]].  

At the [[Meta]] level of analysis, we are working towards the ever increasing ability to interact with and co-creatively influence the True underlying [[Reality]], and not only our limited and simplified perceptual representations of it. 

Our [[Meta Model]] will necessarily have to start with the [[ONE]] / [[Ultimate Reality]], advance to the [[Reality]] emerging from it as ONE Living Superorganism, and then map [[Reality]] into the varying illusory perceptions of [[SpaceTime]] so that we can make predictions and test it across different levels of access and analysis.  

This is a critical step towards liberating ourselves from the perceived limitations of [[SpaceTime]].
