# Quests

A [[Quest]] is a [[Journey]] toward a specific [[Mission]] or a [[Goal]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], we use [[Quests]] as a basic Way to help us establish and clarify our [[Narrative Framework]], and [[Stack Up And Align]] [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

Each sovereign is encouraged to engage in unique quarterly [[Quests]] towards meaningful [[Goals]] and [[Objectives]] that help the federation [[Progress]] along the [[Critical Path]] towards the overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]].
