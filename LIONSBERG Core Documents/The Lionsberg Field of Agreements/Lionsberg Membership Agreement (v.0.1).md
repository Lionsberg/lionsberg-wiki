# Lionsberg Membership Agreement (v.0.1)

 

## Higher Order Functional Unity 

The Purpose of the Lionsberg Community is to connect, serve, and empower a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among Citizens of Good Intent. This is necessary in order to meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities inherent in this unique moment in history. 

 
1. **Process**: Prospective members must complete the [[Lionsberg Membership Process]], which helps ensure a comprehensive understanding and alignment with the Lionsberg Principles and Values, as well as an assessment of willingness, skills, and capacity to contribute, as the member is able, to the collective well-being of the Lionsberg Community. 
2.  **Approval and Mutual Consent**: The Lionsberg Community, collectively or through its designees, reserves the right to approve or deny membership applications based on the assessment of alignment, capacity for contribution, and the community's capacity to support new members in a way that is regenerative and maintains balance and harmony. Once formally approved for membership and issued [[Lionsberg Identity]], a member may refer to themselves as a Lionsberg Community Member. 
3. **Continuing Membership**: Continued membership requires the ongoing consent of both the member and the Lionsberg Community. 

## **Economy**: 

1. **The Lionsberg Economic System**: The [[Lionsberg Economic System]] is first a way of looking at economic relationships in terms of stewardship, regenerativity, freedom, collaboration, right relationship, justice, and community, and secondly an effort to explore and develop wise mechanisms to support those qualities in an emergent economic federation. 
2. **Economic Participation**: Members may have opportunities to participate together economically, and will be encouraged to purposefully build the Lionsberg Economy upon the Lionsberg Principles and Values.  
3. **Free Market Stewardship**: Members will be encouraged to establish and structure economic entities on the basis of decentralized free market stewardship and collaborative governance, as a way beyond the false dichotomies of state control and provincial self-interest. 
4. **Federation**: Members will be encouraged to structurally federate all emergent economic activity with the Lionsberg Community, in order to ensure transparency, accountability, reciprocity, and functional unity across the federation. 
5. **Voluntary Group Tithe**: All federated groups will contribute ~10% of their available flow of time, energy, attention, and resources to the Lionsberg Community for the purpose of continuously improving the Lionsberg Commons of infrastructure, resources, ideas, services, and supports helping all members rise towards their potential and flourish in harmony. 
6. **Charity and Justice**: Groups will be encouraged to use the second tenth of their available flow of value to do charity and justice by addressing the root causes of suffering, dysfunction, and injustice around them. 
7. **Profit Sharing:** Groups will be encouraged to share ~30% of profits among stakeholders to incentive and reward contributions. 
8. **Reinvestment**: Groups will be encouraged to reinvest the remaining ~50% into the ongoing development and flourishing of the economy and community for current and future generations. 
9. **Legacy and Passing The Flame**: Groups will be encouraged to continually be Passing The Flame to future generations by encouraging, mentoring, and developing the next generations of participants. 

## Ideas and Opportunities 

As a result of the synergies of ideas and relationship among a carefully curated and invitation-based Community, many ideas and opportunities will organically arise. 

Aligned Ideas and Opportunities that arise as a result of Participation in Lionsberg or its relationships must be pursued through new or existing ***stewardship based*** groups ***structurally federated*** with Lionsberg, and should be ***coordinated with Lionsberg*** to optimally support the emergence of the Federation and Progress along the Critical Path. 

The Lionsberg System is designed to co-operate on the basis of generating and cultivating emergent ideas and opportunities, co-creating Value, and contributing 1/10th of the Flow of Value back to the Lionsberg Federation to continuously enrich and improve the shared infrastructure, technology, community, culture, and commons. 

Dispersing energy by separating emergent energy or information from the Lionsberg Ecosystem violates the basic Design Intent, which calls for a interconnected, interexistent, and continuously improving multi-generational ecosystem and approach. 

As ideas and opportunities arise, they should be registered with the Lionsberg Commons and acted upon in a transparent and accountable way for the good of the Lionsberg Community, society, and nature as a Whole. 

The decentralized pursuit of emergent ideas and opportunities in a structurally connected federation occurs on the basis of the [[Lionsberg Honor System]], and is crucial to the Designer's Intent. 

## **Reciprocity**: 

1. Members have the responsibility to regularly and meaningfully contribute to and cultivate the Lionsberg Community and Lionsberg Commons in a regenerative way that revitalizes, nourishes, and improves them for future generations. This includes committing to a [[Meaningful Monthly Contribution]]. 
2. Members have the responsibility to help one another create and maintain balance, flow, and reciprocity across all relationships within the System. 

## **Conflict Resolution and Accountability:**

1. **Conflict and Disagreement**: Members recognize that in any large group of people trying to communicate and collaborate in community, it is possible that misunderstandings, disagreements, and conflicts may arise. Members are expected to address such occasions through open, honest, and respectful communication, guided by the wisdom, principles, and values of the Lionsberg System and a genuine desire for mutual understanding, resolution, and reconciliation.
2.  **Integrity and Trust**: Members are expected to hold themselves and others accountable for their actions, commitments, and contributions to the Lionsberg Community and Commons, fostering a culture of integrity, trust, reciprocity, and mutual support.  Realizing that trust takes time to form, members are expected to respect the process and practices through which trust is built. 
3. **Violations of Values or Trust**: If a member has intentionally or repeatedly violated the shared Wisdom, Principles, and Values of the Lionsberg Community, or failed to fulfill responsibilities or commitments made to other members, the Lionsberg community, through an elected [[Accountability Committee]], reserves the right to take appropriate action, including mediation, restorative practices, or termination of membership, following a fair and transparent process that includes an opportunity for the member to address the concerns raised.
4. **Restoration**: Following a just, transparent, and accountable  process, the [[Accountability Committee]] may explore with the member potential avenues for growth, healing, restoration, and reintegration into the Community, along with specific steps or amends that may be required for that reintegration and healing to occur. 
5. **Termination and Withdrawal of Membership:** Members may voluntarily withdraw their membership from the Lionsberg Community at any time by providing written notice to the community representatives as they may be selected from time to time. A withdrawing member is encouraged to explain their reasons for withdrawal, and share insights or lessons learned during their time as a member. If a member is either voluntarily or involuntarily terminated from Lionsberg Community membership, they may no longer refer to themselves as a member of the Lionsberg Community.
