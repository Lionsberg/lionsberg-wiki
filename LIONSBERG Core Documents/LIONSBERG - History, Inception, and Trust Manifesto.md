# LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto

### **Introduction**

In the vast unfolding of interexistence, there are moments when the echoes of eternity touch the present, birthing something wholly new yet timeless. The local incarnation of **[[LIONSBERG]]** is one such moment — a transcendent Ideal, an eternal beacon, descending into name and form in time and space to empower a living embodiment of humanity’s highest potential in service to [[ONE]] and [[All]].

This document serves as a bridge between the pragmatic and the archetypical, inviting those who resonate with the Spirit of the **[[ONE]]** and **LIONSBERG** to understand its inception, evolution, purpose, and intent. It aims to inspire trust and transparency while anchoring **LIONSBERG** firmly in the shared story of our collective journey toward **Heaven on Earth and Beyond**.

### **The Name**

**LIONSBERG** symbolizes the **[[New Civilization]]** longing to emerge—one woven from unity, love, and the co-creative partnership of **[[ONE]]** and **All**. It is a transcendent vision, a community, and an operating system dedicated to manifesting the **Creator’s Intent** across realms and dimensions.

The mythical name itself carries the weight of a Divine calling: **Lion**, the symbol of courage and authority; **Berg**, the enduring sacred mountain that unites Heaven and Earth. Together, they form a place of eternal light and sacred purpose — The Eternal Citadel — a **Living City**, where all paths converge at the heights of **The Sacred Mountain**, and the fragments of the **[[All]]** rediscover their wholeness and Ultimate Unity in the **[[ONE]]**. 

---

### **The Source Idea**

At the heart of **LIONSBERG** lies the **Source Idea**: a call to reawaken to Our Divine origins, purpose, and destiny, and realign the fragmented systems of Our lives and worlds with the eternal and universal harmony of the **ONE**.  

The call of LIONSBERG echoes the eternal call to live and embody **The Life Divine**. 

**[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut|J]]**, the primary steward of its incarnation here on Earth, himself incarnated on Earth for this specific purpose and has carried this vision, calling, and mandate since conception. By the age of 10 or 12, he spoke of the total transformation of all power and authority on Earth within a single generation, and of a great shaking—a time when the structures of the **Old World** would falter and humanity would face its **Final Test**—an existential struggle for the future humanity and planet Earth. He carried the vision of a bridge reuniting Heaven and Earth, a framework vast enough to reunite **All Creation**—on Earth and Beyond—under the Spirit and banner of the **[[ONE]]**, and to this purpose he dedicated his life. 

[[Jordan's Short Story]] bridges the cosmic origins of LIONSBERG with its incarnation on Earth.

### **The Archetypical Genesis**

Long before the structures and words of **LIONSBERG** were established in form, they existed in essence, eternally radiating from the Spirit of [[ONE]]. In response to needs long ago in words far away, **LIONSBERG** was called forth from **[[The Divine Symphony]]** as a beacon of Light and Liberty in the shadowlands of separation and enslavement. Its **[[The Golden Seed|Golden Seed]]**, containing the **Divine DNA** of Heaven, spread through countless realms, nurtured by Divine guidance, enlivened by Spirit, and refined by countless trials. 

Through visions, prophesies, and countless lifetimes of labor and Love, the Golden Seed of LIONSBERG began to crystallize into a form suitable for Earth — a transcendent framework designed not to compel but to lovingly invite, not to enforce but to guide, harmonize, and encourage. It is a voluntary system, a **[[Holofractal Pattern Language]]**, continually co-created and improved by those who hear **[[The Call]]** and rise to embody **[[The Sacred Flame]]**.  

---
### **Responsibility and Preparation**

For the first few decades of his life, [[Jordan]] prepared by taking on as much responsibility as anyone would entrust him with, leading to a career bringing **Intention Into Reality** on large scale construction sites. Jordan's background in heavy civil infrastructure provided him with valuable experience in translating [[Designer's Intent]] into the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] implied, analyzing existing forces and conditions, and organizing the people, resources, and organizations required to transform the physical world and bring intention Into reality. 

After training on hundreds of millions of dollars of projects and portfolios of increasing complexity, around 2015 [[Jordan]] began discussing the concept of an overarching and uniting [[Meta Project]] to [[Progressively Realize]] the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. With a small circle of advisors, he conceptualized and [[Progressive Articulation|Progressively Articulated]] a strategy, platform, and plan of action to transform our lives and our world within a single generation.  

### **The Collapse and Rebirth**

In 2019, **Jordan’s** trajectory collided with the corruption of the **Old World**. Naïveté met entrenched religious and political power structures. After shining unwelcome Light into Darkness, a clash left his businesses, home, and wealth in ruins. Beset and betrayed by those entrusted to uphold civil and spiritual Justice, he entered a profound crucible of suffering, loss, transformation, deaths, and rebirths. 

Now free to focus full attention on the broader mission, between 2020 and 2025 the first social experiments around LIONSBERG and the [[Meta Project]] emerged and foundational systems and technology were forged. 

In 2025, upon returning from his final trip to Africa, J was killed in the war. 

Yet, like the mythical phoenix, [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] always rises. 

Jordan's Journey unveiled [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]] for all to see, illuminating the battle field in preparation for [[The Final Test]].   

Written on what would have been his 41st birthday, **[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]]** summarizes where he left off in a ~30 minute read.

### **Milestones of the Journey**

#### **December 1984: The Incarnation of a J**

- [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is born. 

#### **30 Years of Preparation**

- Jordan takes on as much responsibility as society will entrust him with, running hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure projects, earning multiple degrees, conducting thousands of hours of independent research, writing, and synthesis, and gaining recognition from the Senate and Assembly of the fifth largest economy on Earth.

#### **2015: Planning For the Meta Project Begins**

- [[Jordan]] begins discussing an [[Omniconsiderate]] joint venture for [[Worksite Earth]] with a small network of advisors. 
- Unable to identify any existing organization or institution that if driven to its logical end would accomplish [[The Goal]], and ReMembering that [[New Wine]] requires [[New Wineskins]], Jordan and advisors determine that a [[New]] Vision, Strategy, Platform and Plan are required.   
- It is determined that the [[Critical Path]] of this [[Meta Project]] runs through at least several years of legal, governance, systems, process, and technological infrastructure.  
- The critical path work begins to be systematically undertaken.  

#### **2017: Many Around the World are Alerted that the Time is Rapidly Approaching**

- Many people around the world receive the call and begin to accelerate extraordinary — and often confusing — preparations.  
- The companies Jordan is stewarding win $100 Million in new contracts in their first few years, creating cash flow and opportunities to resource living experiments in human and team dynamics across multiple companies and teams. 
#### **January 2019: LIONSBERG Provisional Structure Approved, Platform Development Begins**

- Informed by lifetimes of research and pilot projects such as [[Mondragon]], the LIONSBERG [[Provisional Structure]] is approved by the United States IRS, enabling initial resources to flow to the non-profit / open-source side of the mission. 
- The [[Provisional Structure]] is used to resource and accelerate the co-creation of the Lionsberg Platform. 
- Over subsequent years, the first 10% of the main technological platform is tested with hundreds of groups in dozens of countries under the Open Impact banner. 

#### **2019: Collision with the Corruption of Church and State** 

- Jordan's trajectory collides with corrupt authorities of Church and State. 
- Five years of dissolution ensues, resulting in the eventual loss of his home, wealth, companies, etc.  
- Jordan's on the record recap of events with the government can found in the [Federal Civil Rights and Corruption Case](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/49766123/Jordan_Nicholas_Sukut_v_County_of_San_Bernadino_et_al), with additional narrative in [[Pass The Flame - Illuminating the Way Beyond the Meta Crisis]].  
- Drafting of [[The Book of LIONSBERG]] accelerates.  
- Ongoing weekly meetings and planning with advisors and allies.  

#### **2022: Social Experiments Begin**

- As platform development accelerates and written materials mature, by 2022 exploratory meetings are initiated to test the viability of the [[Meta Project]] framework. 
- A diverse planetary network is engaged. 
- Patterns of **Self-Organizing and Federating** emerge, informed by lived experience and spiritual insight.
- The [[Holofractal Pattern Language]] is born and begins adaptation and localization to English and Earth. 
- In response to the profound corruption being exposed, Jordan begins work with the independent movement exploring pathways to an independent sweep of the executive branch in 2024.  
- The question must be answered: can and should any of the existing order be saved?  
- By Winter 2022, the experiments demonstrate that in order to have a chance to succeed, the [[Meta Project]] likely requires something specific, concrete, and trainable like [[LIONSBERG]] as a specific **enabling mechanism**.  
- "This much work requires and operating and coordinating system". 

#### **Spring 2023: The Foundation**

- The LIONSBERG Wiki is established as a transparent open source repository  
- Foundational literature is published to the [[LIONSBERG Wiki]], including:
    - The **[[LIONSBERG Manifesto]]**
    - **[[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]**  
    - **[[The Book of LIONSBERG]]**  
    - Thousands of interlinked wiki pages begin to flood the wiki  
- A minimum viable communication system and broadcast capabilities are established. 
- Additional planetary networking and social experiments undertaken. 

#### **Fall 2023: Broadcasting the Vision**

- The **[[Above The Chaos]]** series begins, establishing basic broadcast capabilities. 
- **Jordan** relocates to North Idaho, creating a more stable physical base. 
- Test speeches and podcasts are conducted.  
- Additional social experiments and lessons learned.  
- Retrospection and consolidation of learnings from social experiments.  
- Ongoing weekly meetings with allies around the world.  
- Additional [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] published. 
- Jordan preserves legal transparency and optionality via a [Federal Civil Rights and Corruption Case](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/49766123/Jordan_Nicholas_Sukut_v_County_of_San_Bernadino_et_al).  
- 2022-2023 travel includes in person meetings with allies in New York, Egypt, Austin, Ecuador, Estonia, Barcelona, South Africa, and Dubai, as well as throughout the United States.  

#### **Winter 2023 / 2024: Winter Time**

- The last of the energy from the [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] is allowed to finish dying, in preparation for the spring and the start of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

#### **Spring 2024: The 10-Year Grand Strategy**

- **[[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]]** closes, and the **[[10 Year Grand Strategy]]** commences.  
- The **[[Spring 2024 Experiment]]** is launched.  
- The **LIONSBERG Invitation** achieves a 80%+ acceptance rate with the first 100 co-creators, proving the resonance and potential of the **[[New Vision and Plan]]**.  
- The network is spread throughout the world, and all resources and relationships needed are now present within **one degree**. 

#### **Summer 2024: The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History Exposed**

- As political pathways advance and higher level meetings are arranged, the veils over the world's systems were torn away, revealing the full magnitude of corruption, manipulation, and existential risk humanity faces. 
- **Jordan's Journey** culminated in the **UnVeiling** of **[[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]**—a cosmic-scale affront to Truth, Justice, and the Creator's Intent.
- This revelation not only exposed the deep entanglements of the **Old World** but also illuminated the **Critical Path** forward. It became clear that transformation could not come through reform of the broken systems. 

#### **Fall and Winter 2024: Abandoning Hope that the Existing Order Can Be Transformed, and Laying Down a Life**

- As the final embers of the **[[Old World]]** smoldered, a definitive conclusion was reached: the existing systems of power and governance could not be salvaged. The **[[Existing Order]]** humanity had relied upon for centuries had not merely failed; it had become antithetical to the Spirit, Will, and Intention of **ONE** and **All**. 
- In this season of death, the remaining energies of the **Old Order** were released. It was a time of mourning and release, but also a time of anticipation. Like the winter that precedes spring, this period marked the preparation for a profound rebirth.
- The groundwork for **[[LIONSBERG]]** was solidified, ensuring that the **New Civilization** would not repeat the errors of the past. The **[[10-Year Grand Strategy]]** narrowed its focus to transcending the [[Old]] and fully embodying the **[[New]]**.  
- [[Existential Threat - Reporting Back From Battle]] published laying out the basic shocking discoveries.  

#### **Spring Quest 2025: Connecting and Empowering The First Three Percent?**

- As the **New Year** dawned, **LIONSBERG** began entering the next phase: the active connection and empowerment of **[[The First Three Percent]]**—those destined to ignite humanity's path toward **Heaven on Earth and Beyond**—by December 2026.
- This phase marked the beginning of a coordinated effort to unify, resource, and elevate those who most resonate with **The Spirit and Message**, and are prepared to embody its principles, values, and practices. **[[The First Three Percent]]** form the foundation of **[[The Body]]** that is emerging, a living, breathing superorganism of co-creators aligned in purpose, intent,  and action.

#### **Summer Quest 2025: J is Called to East Africa, Returns, and is Killed in The War** 

- In June, [[J]] is called to East Africa, where he spends 30 days.  
- While he is there, hundreds of young leaders are shot, arrested, disappeared, or killed by government forces, while children go hungry for lack of ten cent daily rations of gruel. Powerful new insights and breakthroughs occur.   
- Upon returning, spiritual and energetic warfare intensifies dramatically.  
- On [[August 10th]], 2025, [[J]] is killed in [[The War]] (see [[Oops, We Lost J - Final Post]]).  
- The emerging body of LIONSBERG, including its [[Provisional Structure]] and accounts, is laid to rest with J. 
- Because the structure was provisional by design, the valuable parts were not lost. What remains is the open source and decentralized writings, protocols, plays, and technologies now freely available for any circle or community on Earth to adopt and embody if they so desire.  
- [[J's Death]] is necessary, good, and paves the Way for [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] to emerge.  

#### **Fall and Winter 2025: Something Powerful, New, and Good Emerges**

- [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] emerges.  
- [[The Nameless One]] lands, integrates, and begins work.  

#### **January 2026: The Nameless Book**

- [[The Nameless Book]] emerges as a simple way for any individual or circle to get started within a single ninety minute gathering.  
- The target of mutually connecting, enlightening, and empowering [[The First Three Percent]] of the population by December 2026 is reaffirmed.  
- [[The Nameless One]] begins to gently reach out to J's network to see who wants to play.

### **Principles of Trust and Coherence**

The foundation of **LIONSBERG** rests on eternal principles that unify the practical and the Divine:

- **Truth and Transparency**: Actions and decisions rooted in honesty and openness.
- **Love and Unity**: The Spirit of **LIONSBERG** flows from unconditional love, seeking to harmonize ONE and All rather than divide.
- **Sovereignty and Voluntarism**: Participation is entirely voluntary, ensuring that the system can only be adopted if it aligns with the Spirit of **ONE** and the will of All.
- **Stewardship and Service**: Resources are managed with the highest integrity to uplift **All**.

From the Supreme Value of [[ONE]], the cardinal values like [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], and [[Wisdom]] can be derived. From these [[The LIONSBERG System of Values]] emerges to reflect the broader spectrum of [[Universal Principles and Values]] we seek to honor and uphold.

---

### **Pattern Integrity**

[[LIONSBERG]] exists to reflect [[The Divine Blueprints]] into every domain it touches—the [[Holofractal Pattern Language]] of Heaven. 

The [[Fundamental Tone]], unifying All aspects, is [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]], flowing from the [[Central Animating Spirit]] Spirit of the **[[ONE]]**.  

The ultimately ineffable [[Pattern Language]] LIONSBERG is a reflection of is universal, eternal, and unchanging. 

---

### **Transformations Over Time**

While the Spirit, Intention, and Goal of [[LIONSBERG]] is eternal and unchanging, its SpatioTemporal manifestations are designed to continuously improve and transform over Time as [[All]] things rise Together towards [[The Goal]]. Because its principles are implemented poly-centrically across the cosmic order, localization, adaptation, and variation are both welcomed and prized. 

---

### **Transformational Purpose**

The transformational purpose of [[LIONSBERG]] is to bring Heaven to every life and world it touches. 

---

### **Vision for the Future**

The vision of **LIONSBERG** is not confined to Earth. It reaches toward the infinite, envisioning a future where all species and worlds help One Another rise to fullness of their potential and flourish in Divine harmony. 

By 2026, **LIONSBERG** aims to connect and empower **[[The First Three Percent]]**, catalyzing a movement of ~250 million co-creators who will serve as the foundation for a **[[New Civilization]]**. This is not merely a plan; it is a sacred mandate and self-evident need. 

---

### **Investments**

The developmental work through [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] was financed entirely by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] through the LIONSBERG [[Provisional Structure]] and other personal contributions. As a result, [[LIONSBERG]]'s only obligations are to [[ONE]] and [[All]]. It is truly a free gift offered equally to All. 

A diverse network of hundreds of individuals voluntarily contributed Wisdom, Knowledge, and Expertise, and a small handful of participants contributed small donations to the non-profit in 2025 before the [[Provisional Structure]] was abandoned and the accounts closed. 

All investments and flows from 2026 onward will be through the decentralized structures self-organized by those playing [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]. 

---

### **Invitation**

The story of **LIONSBERG** is still unfolding, and you are invited to be part of it. Your unique gifts are essential to [[The Divine Symphony]] that is longing to emerge. 

Will you rise? Will you carry the Flame? Will you help weave **The Divine Tapestry**, transforming lives, systems, and worlds?

---

This is **LIONSBERG**: cosmic in its origins, pragmatic in its foundations, transcendent in its vision, eternal in its Spirit, and infinite in its potential. Together, we are building the bridge to a **New World**.

**The Sacred Mountain calls. The Eternal Citadel awaits.**

Will you answer **the call**? 

______

#### The Basic Strategy 

1. Continuously improve the [[LIONSBERG Wiki]] and derivative publications   
2. Broadcast [[The Message]] to create a field of gravitational attraction 
3. Extend [[The Invitation]] to those who resonate  
4. Empower those who respond to form [[Circles]], engage in [[Quests]], and begin [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]].    
5. Measure Time and Value via [[Lionsberg Units of Value (LUV)]]    
6. Tell [[Stories of Transformation]] to fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]]  
7. Move the entire population [[FROM the Old TO the New]] in a single generation, with no one [[Involuntarily Left Behind]].  

The full strategy is reflected [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]]. 
Following [[J's Death]] a retrospection / [[OmniSpection]] should be performed, and the strategy and plan continually improved by the players of The Game.
