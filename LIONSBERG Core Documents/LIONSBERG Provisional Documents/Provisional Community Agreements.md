8. If individuals wish to discuss non-public or proprietary information, individuals should set up separate forums for those discussions.

11. All Teams / Groups we co-create will devote [[The First Tenth]] of their available [[Flow]] of time and resources to [[The Commons]] towards co-creating the shared infrastructure, resources, and services that lift up [[All]].  
12. All shared infrastructure, resources, and services will be stewarded and continuously improved as part of the [[Lionsberg Commons]].  
13. We will continuously learn, grow, improve, and refine by engaging in regular [[Retrospection]] across all [[Levels of Analysis]].  
14. We are committed to the Health, Wellbeing, and Development of flourishing and abundant Life and Consciousness at all levels - individual, group, local, social, planetary, and out to universal scale.
