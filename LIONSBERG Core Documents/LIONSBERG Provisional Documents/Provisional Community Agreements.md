3. We will [[Doing Our Best]] to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] in a Spirit of Love, Wisdom, and Goodness.  
4. Politics, Religion, and Ideology must be checked at the door. LIONSBERG has no state religion, no ideology, no dogma, no orthodoxy, no politics, and no proselytizing. We are navigating towards Wisdom and Truth together in Community.  
5. Aggregated resources will initially be transparently stewarded through the [[Provisional Structure]] via the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) or one of its special purpose vehicles.   
6. All official meetings will be recorded, broadcasted and otherwise used as part of the [[LIONSBERG Media Project]] to engage hearts, minds, and momentum around the world.  
7. If individuals wish to discuss non-public or proprietary information, individuals should set up separate forums for those discussions. 
8. All ideas and thought generated in community is for the Common Good and will be stewarded as part of The LIONSBERG Commons. Until a successor agreement is developed, the Creative Commons license at the bottom of this web page will apply.  
9. All opportunities and needs will be pursued through Federated Teams. The Principle of Federation is the Wise Right Way, that allows for optimal Decentralization. We commit to [[Federate Everything]].   
10. All Teams / Groups we co-create will devote [[The First Tenth]] of their available [[Flow]] of time and resources to [[The Commons]] towards co-creating the shared infrastructure, resources, and services that lift up [[All]].  
11. All shared infrastructure, resources, and services will be stewarded and continuously improved as part of the [[Lionsberg Commons]].  
12. We will continuously learn, grow, improve, and refine by engaging in regular [[Retrospection]] across all [[Levels of Analysis]].  
13. We are committed to the Health, Wellbeing, and Development of flourishing and abundant Life and Consciousness at all levels - individual, group, local, social, planetary, and out to universal scale.
