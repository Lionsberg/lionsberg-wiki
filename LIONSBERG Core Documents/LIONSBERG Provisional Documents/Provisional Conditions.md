# Provisional Conditions

We are striving to articulate and co-create the total set of conditions necessary for resources, energy, and attention to align and flow to a plan of action capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in this moment in history. 

This is a [[Work In Progress]]. If anything is missing or inadequate, please let us know and help us improve it. 

## Self-Evidency
We perceive the needs and solutions outlined below are self-evident, flowing from Love in response to the problems, needs and opportunities inherent in this moment in history. The words herein are simply a reminder of what we all know and have been moving in service of. 

## A Federation / Tribe / Community of Sovereigns
The objective of this effort is to convene, connect, and empower a federation / tribe / body / community of sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities into a functioning, self-governing, self-sustaining, and self-replicating global body independent and transcendent of the dysfunctional structures of the Old World. 

## Clear Platform and Creed
In support of this, we have established a platform of ideas and technologies, and a simple, universal mission / creed: _designing and building a better world_. 

We are coming together to empower individuals, organizations, and communities to co-operate to elevate and transform their lives and their world. 

## Tipping Point Strategy 
We anticipate that the [[Critical Path]] lies along a tipping point strategy centered around story and experience, leading to a shift in paradigm / consciousness, followed by connection and co-operation with a mission and values driven platform / community. This combination of story, memetics, and technology creates the potential to follow the exponential scaling patterns of idea / technology adoption curves. 

Our hypothesis is that the stories and experiences will flow from getting into action as a community on a series of projects to meet needs and solve problems, that can grow in their scope and complexity over time. 

## Embodiment 
While we recognize that what is trying to emerge is universal in scope, we also recognize that we need a structure and place to act out the "Spirit" of it - for that reason we have established [[LIONSBERG]] and the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]].
