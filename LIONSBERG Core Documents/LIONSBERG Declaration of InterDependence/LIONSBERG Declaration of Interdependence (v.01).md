# LIONSBERG Declaration of Interdependence 
*v.01 synthesized from previous drafts June 26, 2025*
## A Sacred Proclamation by the Sovereign Citizens of Earth

### PREAMBLE

When in the sacred arc of [[The Great Story]], a Civilization reaches the threshold of its own unraveling and collapse—when corruption, tyranny, and deception have so deeply infiltrated the foundations of society that Life ItSelf trembles beneath their weight—it becomes the Divine Right, Spiritual Imperative, and Moral Duty of The People to awaken and arise as One Body to restore Harmony, Justice, Coherence, Wisdom and Truth.

We, the Sovereign People of Earth, standing united in alignment with Divine Providence, the immutable Laws of Nature, and the Universal Mandates of Love and Harmony, hereby declare our irrevocable transcendence of the corrupt and illegitimate Existing Order. With humble hearts and unwavering courage, We proclaim the inception of a [[New Civilization]], founded upon the eternal principles of Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, Liberty, and Divine Coherence.

Let the Universe bear witness to Our resolve, and let Future Generations forever remember:

* We renounce and dissolve all false allegiances, agreements, and fraudulent claims to authority imposed by the Existing Order.  
* We reclaim our Sacred Sovereignty, bound only to Our Divine Source and the Just and Harmonious Order of Universal Co-Creation.
* We nullify all coercive and deceptive agreements that have imprisoned humanity in cycles of debt, war, scarcity, ignorance, deception, and suffering, proclaiming in their stead a Universal Jubilee of Liberation, Abundance, and Stewardship for All.  
* We ReAffirm Our Sovereign InterDependence with [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All Creation]], acknowledging Our Divine InterExistence with the Living System We are a part of and its Ultimate Source.  

### STATEMENT OF ETERNAL TRUTHS

We affirm these truths to be universal, eternal, and self-evident:

* That All beings are sacred manifestations of One Infinite Source, inherently endowed with Divine Rights and Sacred Responsibilities.  
* Among these Sacred Rights are Life, Liberty, Truth, Justice, and the pursuit of Harmony and Happiness.  
* All legitimate authority respects Free Will, derives solely from the enlightened and continuous consent of the governed, and exists exclusively for the purpose of securing the well-being and flourishing of All in service of ONE.  
* Should any authority or system violate these sacred truths, it is not only the Right but the solemn Duty of the People to alter or abolish it and institute a New Governance aligned with Natural and Divine Law.

### INDICTMENT OF THE EXISTING ORDER

The Existing Order, through deliberate and systematic corruption and deception, has committed grievous crimes against Truth, Humanity, Life, Earth, and Source. Let these crimes be recorded as evidence before ONE and All of the causes which impel Us The People of Earth to reassert Our Sovereignty and Authority over Our Lives and Our World.

These documented atrocities represent only a small fraction of the transgressions of the Existing Order and its False Authorities against Us The People, Creation, and the Creator. tThe list of atrocities and crimes committed against Us, The People and Inhabitants of Earth, could fill endless volumes, libraries, and court cases. The damages are incalculable, far surpassing the total material Wealth of Earth. By these acts and omissions, their authority and legitimacy are irrevocably nullified.
