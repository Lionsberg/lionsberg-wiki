# LC 27. Horizontal Structures and Protections

In our shared journey towards our destiny, we, the citizens of Lionsberg, recognize the importance of robust horizontal structures and protections across our society. These mechanisms ensure that every individual, community, and institution is provided with equal protection, respect, and opportunity, and that power cannot be unjustly consolidated in one function of society, thereby upholding the spirit of our constitution throughout all aspects of societal life.

## Principles

The fundamental principles of our Horizontal Structures and Protections are Transparency, Accountability, Due Process, and appropriate Checks and Balances. These principles apply across all aspects of society and at each level of the Lionsberg System, ensuring that power is appropriately balanced and that each citizen and institution operates within the framework of our shared principles, values, policies, and laws.

## Application Across Systems

The horizontal structures and protections apply fractally throughout each level of the Lionsberg System, including the Citizen Assembly, Executive, Legislative, Regulatory, Reconciliation, and Justice systems. They establish checks and balances and enable local correction and decision-making at every level of our society.

In the Citizen Assembly, the principle of transparency ensures that decisions are made openly, with the participation and knowledge of all relevant stakeholders. Accountability ensures that each Citizen Assembly and its members are answerable for their actions, while due process ensures that all deliberations and decisions adhere to established procedures and are subject to review and appeal. The clear delegation of Responsibility and Authority by function ensures that checks and balances are present within each assembly, and that no individual or faction can gain inordinate influence. 

In the Executive, Legislative, Regulatory, Reconciliation, and Justice systems, the horizontal structures and protections ensure that each system operates within its mandate and respects the rights, freedoms, and roles of others. Checks and balances prevent the concentration or misuse of power, while due process ensures that all actions are conducted in accordance with the law. Operating at all fractal levels though the Citizen Assembly System, these horizontal structures and protections provide a robust framework for the appropriate distribution and exercise of power throughout the Lionsberg System. 

## Inter-System Communication and Collaboration

To foster synergy and cooperation among different systems, mechanisms are established for communication, collaboration, and conflict resolution. Integrated by the Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System and Lionsberg Communication System, These mechanisms promote mutual understanding, respect, and solidarity, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our society and our collective efforts to progress towards our shared Goals and Values. 

## Horizontal Protections

Horizontal protections safeguard the rights, freedoms, and dignity of all individuals and groups against potential infringements or abuses. These protections apply at each level and within each system, ensuring that all citizens and institutions enjoy equal protection under the law, and are appropriately protected from the other functions of the System they co-operate with. 

## Fostering Horizontal Integration

Through horizontal integration, we celebrate the diversity of our unique functions within the Body, foster mutual respect and understanding, and encourage empathy and solidarity among all members of our society. This integration enhances social cohesion and facilitates collective action towards our shared goals and values. 

## Dealing with Disruptions

In the event of major disruptions that impact the normal functioning of horizontal structures, temporary measures may be instituted by the Lionsberg General Assembly to ensure the continuity of governance. These measures must respect the spirit and values of our constitution and should be discontinued as soon as normal operations can safely resume.

Through these Horizontal Structures and Protections, we strive to create a society that is united in diversity, where power is appropriately balanced, and where each individual, group, and institution contributes constructively to our collective journey.
