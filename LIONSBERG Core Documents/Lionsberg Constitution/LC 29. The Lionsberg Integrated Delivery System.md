# LC 29. The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System empowers Citizens and Localities to work together to ensure that services and resources are efficiently and justly coordinated to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System enables the total set of interoperable, sovereign, and autonomous individual and local actions to be stacked up and aligned in order to produce [[Throughput]] of our overarching and uniting [[Goals]] and [[Values]]. Organically complexifying from the bottom up, it avoids the potential for catastrophic top down control, while empowering a diverse array of unique expressions to work together to provision one another with far greater goods, services, benefits, infrastructure and resources than any individual or locality could access in isolation.
