# LC 35. The Lionsberg Legal System

The Purpose of the Lionsberg Legal System is to safeguard the emergence of a just, impartial, and accessible system that upholds the rule of law, rightly relates to existing systems, and enables the protection of individual and local rights and responsibilities for all Citizens. 

The Lionsberg System and Approach recognizes the necessity for all forms of emergent life to have proper structure to facilitate, protect, and support the emergence.

The Lionsberg Constitution recognizes that a sound legal structure is integral to the co-creation of a just, loving, and good society, and that it must be developed and used in a way that upholds the principles of justice, fairness, and the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. The Lionsberg Constitution seeks to lay the groundwork for a legal system where the rights and responsibilities of all individuals and localities are protected and fulfilled, and where the common good of society and the environment is considered across multiple generations. 

The [[Lionsberg Legal System]] is designed around a diverse ecosystem of stewardship-based legal structures developed organically from the bottom up in way that is appropriate to the function of each [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority|Domain of Responsibility and Authority]]. As a result of developing in a Way that meets or exceeds the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]], this diverse multiplicity can function in [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] on the basis of [[Agreements]]. 

The Lionsberg Constitution recognizes that the proper development and implementation of a complex legal system to advance society towards [[The Goal]] requires the active participation of all Citizens in the co-creation of a system of structures that reflects their highest aspirations and values. 

It must ensure that the rights and responsibilities of all individuals and localities are protected and fulfilled, that responsibility and authority remain rightly distributed to ensure sovereignty and autonomy throughout the structure, and that Justice is served throughout the System.
