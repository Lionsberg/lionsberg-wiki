# LC31.  Mechanisms for Transformation

Lionsberg provides mechanisms for transformation that allow the Constitution and the entire Lionsberg System to adapt and evolve in response to new challenges and opportunities. This flexibility ensures the continued relevance and effectiveness of the guiding principles, values, and systems throughout the coming millennia. 

The Lionsberg System is built to evolve and transform from the bottom up over time on the basis of [[Proposals]] and [[Consent]] that reflect the collective wisdom and discernment of Citizens. 

The Lionsberg System and Constitution can be changed on the basis of Proposals from any Group, and Consent from All Groups, provided that such changes progressively conform the Lionsberg System and Approach closer to integrity with its Central Animating Spirit.
