# The LIONSBERG Constitution  
*A New Covenant for the New Civilization on Earth and Beyond*

**PREAMBLE**

We, the Free and Sovereign Inhabitants of Earth and Beyond, recognizing Our Unity with [[ONE]], One Another, and All Creation, and guided by Eternal Truth, Universal Justice, and Divine Love, do hereby establish this Constitution as a sacred Covenant to steward Our New Civilization.

Having witnessed the collapse of the corrupt and oppressive [[Old]] Systems, and having reclaimed Our inherent Sovereignty and Dignity, We affirm Our sacred responsibility to uphold and fulfill the Creator’s Intent—**On Earth and Beyond as it is in Heaven**.

Recognizing the profound interconnectedness of All things, this Constitution sets forth the principles, structures, and commitments by which We shall govern ourselves, regenerate Our Culture and Planet(s), and flourish in perpetual harmony with Divine Intention, Natural Law, and Universal Wisdom.

We solemnly establish this Covenant in the presence of the Supreme Source, Architect and Judge of the Universe, pledging ourselves as stewards of a renewed civilization founded upon the eternal pillars of Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, Harmony, and Coherence.
