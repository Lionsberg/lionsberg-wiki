# LC 41. Freedom of Assembly and Protest

The Lionsberg Constitution specifically respects the right and responsibility of Citizens to assemble in groups to dialogue, protest, worship or for other reasons. 

This includes the right to collectively demand that Representatives take immediate action to solve problems, or to organize to transform Representation in the event that Representatives become unresponsive to challenges and opportunities in a given context.
