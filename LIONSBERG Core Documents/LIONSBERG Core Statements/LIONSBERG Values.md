# LIONSBERG Values

The [[Values]] of **[[LIONSBERG]]** are sacred pillars that guide Our mission, character, and actions in service of **[[ONE]]** and **[[All]]**. These [[Values]] flow from the Spirit of [[ONE]] and embody the eternal and universal principles that inspire and sustain the Path toward unity, transformation, and co-creation.

While the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of [[LIONSBERG]] cannot be reduced to words, it is reflected by [[Values]] such as: 

- **[[Truth]]**: Anchoring all things in integrity and alignment with the eternal essence of the **[[ONE]]**.
- **[[Love]]**: An unconditional and infinite force that heals, unites, and elevates.
- **[[Justice]]**: Ensuring fairness, harmony, and the restoration of balance in all realms.
- **[[Wisdom]]**: Illuminating the Way with clarity, understanding, and Divine insight.
- **[[Stewardship]]**: Nurturing and safeguarding All Creation with responsibility and care.
- **[[Courage]]**: Standing firm in the face of fear, resistance, and darkness to carry the Sacred Flame forward.
- **[[Unity]]**: Weaving the diversity of **[[All]]** into harmony with the Spirit of the **[[ONE]]**.

These values are not static ideals but living principles embodied by **[[LIONSBERG]]**, guiding every action and decision as it seeks to bring **[[Heaven on Earth]]** and Beyond.

[[The LIONSBERG System of Values]] embodies these concepts more fully.
