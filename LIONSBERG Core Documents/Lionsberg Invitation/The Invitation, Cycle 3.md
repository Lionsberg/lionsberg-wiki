# The Invitation, Cycle 3

# The Invitation
*Cycle 3, March 2024*

If you are receiving this, you are among the first I am inviting to formally join us for what I hope and pray evolves into a history-making-adventure-of-a-lifetime. 

As you know, everything is on the line, and it is up to [[Us]] as [[Individuals]] to take responsibility, commit, and do all that is required to meet the needs, solve the challenges, and accomplish the goals at hand. Together. 

Out of the Diverse Many of [[Us]], to begin to Unite As One. 

## After Years of Preparation, It is Time to Run The Play 

March marks the inflection point between the end of [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], and the beginning of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

This is the start of a tipping-point-strategy through which humanity will be invited to collaborate to transform its Way of Being as a human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]], co-creating a New Normal while ensuring that [[The Transformation]] occurs within a single generation. 

## The Spirit and the Written Word

The Spirit of this, and simply knowing me, is far more important than all the words, strategies and plans. We are venturing into the [[Unknown]] together, and we know that [[We Do Not Know]] what lies ahead. 

Nevertheless, I have done my best to articulate some more detail via the links below. Additionally, we are aiming to formalize and publish a book in March that consolidates the Story, Vision, Strategy, and Plan into more accessible form.

The first January Manifesto and Letter provide some thoughts heading into the New Year, and link to a few fireside chats. 

**Running The Play** outlines the simple path forward to begin inviting Individuals of Goodwill to Join Us. 

And the **Game Plan for March** lays out the specific steps and goals to activate the next phase of the Strategy and Plan. Each also contains an abundance of links to explore various elements of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to meet this moment in history.

## The Invitation

This invitation is going to several select several individuals globally, as well as here locally in Sandpoint, Idaho. If a few Individuals in each group accept, we will be on the Path, and will work together to refine [[The Story]] and craft the invitation to subsequent Individuals in our networks. 

All that is required in the next few [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] is to expand from 3, to 5, to 8, and then to 13 Co-Creators. 

That critical first group creates the critical mass to then discern and accomplish the next cycles. 

Our Mission is to transform our lives and our world towards Heaven on Earth by forging the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] pragmatically required to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

To accept this invitation and join the Adventure, visit my website and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement). The form will gather an opening tithe (crucial for establishing commitment and public support for The Mission), along with your contact information (crucial for populating our Communication System). 

I look forward to working together with you to make our Community and our World as much like [[Heaven On Earth]] as we possibly can, while Passing The Flame to the rising generations. 

With Love, In Community,
