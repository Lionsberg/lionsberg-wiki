# Lionsberg Invitation v0.2

### **Subject: A Special Invitation to Co-Create a Brighter Future** 

Dear (insert name), 

Like us, we know that you are deeply cognizant and concerned about the unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities that mark this pivotal moment in history.

You may also be joining us in the realization that no matter how well-intended our efforts are, the truly transformative resources, relationships, and power required to reshape the root causes of our present dilemmas, and co-create the brighter future we all long for, are beyond the grasp of any individual or organization acting in isolation. It is time to come together. 

Emerging as a beacon of hope in these challenging times, Lionsberg is an independent, voluntary international federation, meticulously designed to connect, serve, and empower citizens of goodwill around the world. Our mission is to serve and empower conscious and engaged individuals like you in our shared quest to confront and overcome the challenges of our time, and forge the brighter future we all desire. 

After years of rigorous strategic planning and infrastructure development, a **Pioneer Cohort** of twenty pioneers recently embarked on a transformative **12-week program** via the Lionsberg Orientation and Training System. This program aims to shine a light on the narratives, paradigms, and patterns contributing to our societal dysfunction, while enabling participants to reassess and realign their personal narratives and patterns, and synergize to construct a unified movement, determined to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities that lay before us.

This movement grows organically, on an **invitation-only basis**. Every cohort carefully selects and **invites the subsequent wave** of members, ensuring we engage the right individuals, at the right time, for the right reasons. 

We are thrilled to announce that the **Second Wave Cohort** is now set to embark on this extraordinary journey on June 25th. Welcoming **between 12 and 20 individuals**, this new wave of energy will expand the movement to between 30 and 40 dedicated members.

Keeping the momentum, the **Third Wave Cohort** will follow suit around July 16th, projected to augment the Lionsberg community to between 50 and 80 members.

By the end of Q3, our aim is to break the membership threshold of 100 individuals, a significant milestone that opens a plethora of new possibilities for the Lionsberg Movement.

We believe that you possess unique qualities that make you an ideal candidate for co-creating the Second Wave Cohort, and in shaping the invitations for the Third and Fourth Waves. We warmly invite you to join us on this groundbreaking journey. The commitment involves engaging with daily transformative materials individually, complemented by facilitated group dialogues, governance discussions, and collaborative projects.

After successfully completing the 12-week Orientation and Training program, we extend an invitation for you to become a lifelong member of Lionsberg, joining us in the sustained effort to navigate the local and global challenges that define this pivotal decade, and to rekindle the flame of positive change for generations to come. 

Please respond to this invitation via the [Lionsberg Second Wave Response Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccZdKzafpcOSgtC2fCUzQI3WhhTdibTJYDaRPBd-zGpUFDHw/viewform?usp=sf_link) no later than Wednesday June 21st. If this opportunity does not resonate with you at this moment, we respectfully ask that you let us know so that we can extend the invitation to another potential member.

Feel free to review the [[Lionsberg Participation Agreement (v0.2)]] to further understand the expectations, rights, and responsibilities that accompany membership in Lionsberg. 

With Love and Respect, 

(your name)
