# Quick Fixes

IPD Team members are encouraged to constantly look for better ways of doing their work.

Every member of every team must be empowered to make the necessary changes required to "get [[A Little Better Every Day]]". 

Ideally, each Participant should also be encouraged through incentives to implement these quick fixes and report their results to their co-workers and the [[Core Enterprise]] as part of [[Continuous Learning]] and Improvement.
