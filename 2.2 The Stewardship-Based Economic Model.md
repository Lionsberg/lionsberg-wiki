# 2.2 The Stewardship-Based Economic Model

The Great Game of Lionsberg incorporates a stewardship-based economic model that emphasizes the responsible management and allocation of resources for the well-being of all players, communities, and the environment. This economic model is purpose-driven, designed to support the collective goal of co-creating the [[New World]] and fostering a regenerative and resilient society.

Key aspects of the stewardship-based economic model include:

1.  **Resource Management**: Players are encouraged to manage their resources, including time, energy, attention, and material assets, in a way that prioritizes the long-term health and regenerativity of the community and the environment. This approach fosters mindful consumption, waste reduction, and the efficient use of resources, promoting a culture of sustainability and regeneration.
    
2.  **Collaborative Economy**: The game encourages players to engage in collaborative economic activities such as intentionally sharing, bartering, and exchanging goods and services. This cooperation-based approach promotes community resilience, reduces resource consumption, liberates from the constraints of scare fiat currencies, and fosters a more loving and just distribution of resources among players.
    
3.  **Value-Driven Businesses**: In the Great Game of Lionsberg, businesses and organizations are expected to operate with a focus on purpose and values, prioritizing social and environmental impact over short-term financial gains. This approach incentivizes businesses to adopt regenerative practices, contribute to the welfare of the community, and support the realization of the [[New Vision and Plan]].
    
4.  **Regenerative Practices**: The economic model encourages players to adopt regenerative practices in their daily lives and businesses, such as circular economy principles, permaculture, renewable energy, and ecological restoration. These practices contribute to the long-term resilience and sustainability of the New World, ensuring a healthy and thriving environment for all [[Future Generations]]. 
    
5.  **Fair Distribution of Wealth**: The stewardship-based economic model emphasizes the importance of a fair and just distribution of wealth, ensuring that all players have access to the resources they need to thrive. This includes mechanisms for profit sharing, resource distribution, social safety nets, and opportunities for socioeconomic empowerment.
    

By embracing the stewardship-based economic model, players in the Great Game of Lionsberg contribute to the transformation of society, moving away from unsustainable and exploitative practices and towards a more resilient, just, and regenerative New World.
