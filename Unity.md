# Unity
In the [[LIONSBERG System]], Unity, or [[Oneness]], is used to describe the Ultimate Right Relationship between [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

It has been said that the basic spiritual element in the universe is that which impels us towards Unity through [[Love]]. 

It is the natural response of [[All]] things flowing from [[ONE]] to return to It through [[Love]]. 

The [[Unity]] that lies at the End of the [[Logic of Love]] is not conformity to a central monolith, in which our individuality and uniqueness is extinguished. 

On the contrary, the more closely, powerfully and rightly related we are to [[ONE]] Who is [[Love]], the more the fullness of our unique [[Potential]] will be called up and out of us into ever greater expression.
