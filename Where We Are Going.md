# Where We Are Going
The [[LIONSBERG System]] operates on a [[Narrative Framework]] married up to Systems of Integrated Delivery and Self Governance. 

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[Where We Are Going]] corresponds to the Step 1 of the Integrated Delivery System: Intention. 

It is a [[Word Tool]] used to point at our [[Potential]], our [[Aim]], which is the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] of which we can presently conceive. 

It is Point B, the [[Aim]], progressively [[Realize|Realized]] through a process of Discernment.  

It stands in contrast to Point A - [[Where We Are]].
