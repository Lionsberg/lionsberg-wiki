# Inbreaking And Displacing

The [[Way]] the [[New]] [[Incarnates]] its Self is through (something like) a [[Process]] of [[Inbreaking And Displacing]].  

As we [[Individually And Collectively]] [[Become]], we [[Become]] conduits through which the [[New World]] Inbreaks into every moment in which we are present, displacing the [[Old World]] as it passes away.
Â 
The [[Old World]] is only present where we do not have enough conduits displacing it with the presence and power of the Spirit of [[Love]]. The [[Old World]] cannot stand or remain in presence of transformational [[Love]], just as [[Darkness]] cannot remain in the presence of [[Light]].

As the [[New]] Inbreaks, small [[Pockets Of Coherence, Integrity, and Proper Order]] become visible in the midst of the [[Chaos]]. 

Pockets of [[Space]], [[Time]], [[Being]], and [[Doing]], that when we experience them, we say with our whole heart "This is [[Good]]."  

Each one of these [[Pockets Of Coherence, Integrity, and Proper Order]] can be told as a [[Story]], and [[Every Story Is A Prophesy]] of something even Greater that is [[Possible]]. 

Let us nurture, cultivate, and co-create ever more Pockets of Coherence, and begin to watch as they connect together in [[Right Relationship]] with [[One]] and [[All]].
