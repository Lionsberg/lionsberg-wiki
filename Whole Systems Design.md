# Whole Systems Design

_An approach that considers all components of a system and their interrelationships to optimize overall performance and sustainability. It involves understanding how different elements within a system interact and influence one another, aiming to create synergies and leverage points for improvement. This method is often [used](https://sustain.ok.ubc.ca/policies/whole-systems-plan/what-is-it/) in fields like architecture, engineering, and environmental planning to ensure that all parts of a system work together harmoniously._ (Open Civics)
