# Project Delivery Guide
## Context

Individuals are moved to do something. 

They recognize they cannot do it alone. So they gather a couple other people, read [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]], and [[Forging Or Joining A Team|Forge or Join a Team]]. 

They [[Federate With Lionsberg]] as a Whole, and with one or two other groups or federations to extend their access, resources, and capabilities. 

Now - it is time to get to work. 

Because you are [[Federating]] with other organizations, we would highly recommend that you take the time to learn the basics of the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] and the [[Lionsberg System of Work]].  

As a quick refresher, the core innovation of Integrated Delivery is that it transforms any program of action into a [[Goal Delivery System]]. 

## Everything Is A Project
The activities of an organization should be performed with the understanding that [[Everything Is A Project]]. 

Viewing everything through the lens or framework of project helps everyone, both [[Participants]] and [[Observers]], know what is going and why. 

It also dramatically increases the probability that the Organization will [[Success|Succeed]]. 

## Project Process
The project process through which [[1. Intention]] is brought into [[Reality]] can be thought of as encompassing 6 basic steps: 

1. Intention / Vision  
2. Analysis  
3. Engagement  
4. Planning  
5. Action  
6. Continuous Learning and Improvement. 

### Step 1: Intention
The first step is to ensure that all Participants share the same vision, intention, and goal. If the project were a Quest, this would be akin to understanding [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]].  

### Step 2: Analysis
The second step is to analyze and understand the existing state, forces, and conditions. If the project were a Quest, this would be akin to understanding [[Where We Are]]. 

Understanding these first two elements opens up [[The Gap]] between Point A [[Where We Are]] and Point B [[Where We Are Going]]. 

### Step 3: Engagement
Most of the time, this opening articulation will alert us to the reality that we need to engage additional people, expertise, or resources in order to succeed. The third step therefore is to Engage, and to revisit steps 1 and 2 with the [[Wise Right]] people. 

### Step 4: Planning
The forth step involves engaging the [[Planning System]]. Creating a [[Project Plan]] helps ensure that Participants, Stakeholders, and Observers understand all of the components necessary to complete the project successfully. A Project Plan is also a form of communication and dialogue - it is a way of asking if everything has been thought of, where there might be problems or gaps, and what the expected outcome is. 

### Step 5: Action
The fifth step is to take action and begin to test and act out the Project Plan with [[Courage]] and [[Perseverance]] in light of the [[Challenges]] and [[Obstacles]] that are sure to arise. 

### Step 6: Continuous Improvement
This sixth step encompasses and wraps all the others in an ongoing process of continuously learning and improving the [[Quality]] of: 1) Intention 2) Analysis 3) Engagement 4) Planning 5) Action, and 6) Continuous Improvement. 

Like the [[Scientific Method]], much of this process is rooted in analyzing [[Variance Between Expected And Actual Outcomes]]. 

None of these elements are meant to be static. They are meant to reflect our [[Current Best Understanding]], and to be evolved over time to conform to [[Reality]] ever more closely.
