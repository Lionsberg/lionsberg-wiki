# It Has To Be Utopia Or Oblivion For Us All

“This is what man tends to call utopia. It's a fairly small word, but inadequate to describe the extraordinary new freedom of man in a new relationship to the universe – the alternative of which is oblivion.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]] 

“Whether it is to be Utopia or Oblivion will be a touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment…. Humanity is in a final exam as to whether or not it qualifies for continuance in the Universe” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]
