# The Founder's Fund

The Founder's Fund is an independent fund established to directly sustain J, his core collaborators, and the Critical Path leaders and initiatives they are personally guiding as the broader LIONSBERG community emerges.

The Founder's Fund reports out to members monthly on its sources and uses of resources to help guide the resource allocation of **The Commons**.
