# The Founder's Fund

The Founder's Fund directly sustains J, his core collaborators, and the Critical Path initiatives they are personally guiding as the broader LIONSBERG community emerges.

The Founder's Fund will report out to members monthly on its sources and uses of resources to help guide the resource allocation of **The Commons**.
