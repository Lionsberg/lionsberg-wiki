# The Founder's Fund

**The Founder's Fund** is an independent fund explicitly established to directly sustain J, his core collaborators, and the Critical Path leaders and initiatives they are personally guiding as the broader LIONSBERG community emerges.

The Opening Contribution of each new member is designated to **The Founders Fund**.  

The Founder's Fund reports out to members monthly on its sources and uses of resources to help mutually guide the resource allocation of **The Commons**.
