# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], Lionsberg is [[New Vision and Plan]] for humanity, and a system of systems purpose-built to bring the vision into reality. 

We are working to inspire a diverse global community to design and build itself so that together we can design and build a better world. 

This wiki is a powerful and detailed back-end for more user-friendly and polished front end that is in development. 

Our Aim is to connect and empower individuals, organizations, and communities around the world to meet needs, solve problems, and collaborate together for the good of all.
