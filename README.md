# **Welcome to The Gates of LIONSBERG**
*A Living Path towards Heaven On Earth and Beyond*  
_A Sacred Transmission of the **The Golden Seed**_

Greetings Dear Mirror  
Fellow reflection of the ONE  
At long last you have arrived  
In Perfect Divine Timing  

You are beautiful  
You are beloved  
You are here for a reason  
You belong  

**Welcome Home**  

____

While the details remain opaque and diverse  
It is evident to all that **something is wrong**  

The **old systems** are failing at an accelerating rate  
The **old institutions** have lost our faith and trust  
The **default trajectory** is towards a catastrophic collapse  

Earth has now entered a time of crisis and opportunity  
Unlike any in the last ten thousand years  

___

Like an ancient bridge  
spanning a seemingly impossible chasm  
**LIONSBERG** offers a Way  
to transcend the inevitable collapse  
and begin the **shared journey**  
towards **Heaven On Earth and Beyond**  

However the journey cannot be compelled  
Every individual and locality must make **the choice**  
to **accept the invitation** and **walk the path** towards **The Goal**  

Lifetimes of work and worlds of experience  
have conspired to produce **a real-world game**  
simple enough for any family or circle to play  
and powerful enough to bring Heaven to Earth  

____

Participants commit **The First Tenth** of their time —  
just a few hours a week —  
to transforming their lives and their worlds  
in small resonant circles of 3 to 12 individuals  

Clearly defined shared rhythms, protocols, and plays   
ensure that circles stack up into communities and tribes   
tribes and communities into bioregions and guilds   
and bioregions and guilds into properly ordered worlds  
that bring Heaven to Earth and Beyond  

___

The most accessible Way to begin the great adventure  
is to gather a few other resonant souls  
begin with a moment of grounding, silence, and connection  
and then read aloud **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]**  

It will invite you to step into a shared story  
form a circle, choose a first quest, and begin **The Great Game**  

As The Game unfolds all participants discover  
that they are integral parts of a larger superorganism  
conspiring to design and build to **New Civilization**  

There is no central organization or authority  
There is nothing to sign up for and no one to pay  

All there is to do is accept the free gift  
following the Divine Guidance  
and step into **[[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide|The Game]]**  

____

LIONSBERG incarnated on Earth via  
[[Above The Chaos]] and the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]  

Following [[J's Death]] summer 2025 
[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] is rising  

In 2026, at long last, **The Great Game** begins
