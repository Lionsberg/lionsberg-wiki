# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

As told in [[The Story of the Builder]], everything about [[Lionsberg]] is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], [[Jordan]] and the [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] are articulating a [[New Vision and Plan]] for humanity, and a [[Lionsberg System]] purpose-built to bring the [[Vision Into Reality]]. 

Our Vision, Mission, and Goal is [[Heaven On Earth]]. [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] reflects how we can achieve this within a single generation. 

To get started with the Lionsberg Wiki, we would recommend that you visit the [[Above The Chaos]] series, the [[Lionsberg Summary]], or dive into one of the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]. 

There is more interlinked writing here than in the Bible, which many struggle to read through in a lifetime, so simply pick a starting point such the [[Lionsberg Summary]], dive in, and when you are ready, [[Join The Movement]] to embark on the [[Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]]. 

If you resonate and are ready to connect, visit [Jordan's Website](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement) and [[Join The Movement]], or [[Donate|Donate Here]].
