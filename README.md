# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

You have arrived in an interesting place that is a [[Work In Progress]], and may seem confusing at first. But you've come to the right place. 

_We are attempting to inspire a diverse global community to design and build itself so that together we can design and build a better world_. 

Feel free to explore, recognizing that everything here is being built live and transparently as a [[Work In Progress]]. 

The best way to understand Lionsberg for now is as the convergence of the lifetimes of work from [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a network of allies, purpose-built to connect and empower individuals, organizations, and communities around the world to meet needs, solve problems, and collaborate together for the good of all. 

It is a meta solution created in response to the [[Meta Crisis]].
