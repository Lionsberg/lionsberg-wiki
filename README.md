# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], Lionsberg is putting forward a [[New Vision and Plan]] for humanity, and a system  purpose-built to bring the vision into reality. 

Our mission is to connect and inspire a diverse global community to design and build itself so that together we can design and build a better world. 

This wiki is a powerful and detailed back-end for more user-friendly and polished front end that is in development.   This wiki contains thousands of interrelated pages and topics that are being progressively articulated. If you click a link and it doesn't work it is not an error, it is a feature and inner look into the ongoing development of this cultural artifact. 

[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is the founder and architect of Lionsberg and the [[New Vision and Plan]]. Understanding him will help you understand Lionsberg. [[Above The Chaos]] is Jordan's blog and a place to find some narrative content. 

Jordan's Vision and Goal and Lionsberg's Vision and Goal are to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] and accomplish the [[Meta Goal]] in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

[[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]] offers the most user friendly and accessible outline to New Vision and Plan currently available. 

[[The Lionsberg Meta Guide]] is the most comprehensive overview of the entire [[Lionsberg System]]. 

[[Jordan's Guide to Lionsberg]] is another starting point. 

[[The Book of Lionsberg]] is another work in progress that provides expansive insights into the New Vision and Plan. 

[[Ideas and Inspiration to Become More Involved]] is a simple starting point on things that you can immediately take action on if you would like to begin finding your unique areas of greatest purpose, passion, and contribution. 

A couple other pragmatic resources you might benefit from are works in progress: [[A Way Beyond Fear, Anxiety, And Depression]], and [[The Power of Today]].
