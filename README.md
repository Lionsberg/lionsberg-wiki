# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and Lionsberg are putting forward a [[New Vision and Plan]] for humanity, and a system purpose-built to bring the vision into reality. See [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]. 

Our mission is to connect and inspire a diverse global community to design and build itself so that together we can design and build the better future we all desire. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is articulated the form of a [[Pattern Language]] for the [[New World]], that can be be easily understood and replicated by anyone who wishes to apply it. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] was purpose-built to enable and empower humanity to [[Embody]] the Pattern Language of the New World. 

This wiki is a powerful and detailed back-end for more user-friendly and polished front end that is in development. it contains thousands of interrelated pages and topics that are being progressively articulated. If you click a link and it doesn't work it is not an error, it is a feature and inner look into the ongoing development of this cultural artifact.
