# LIONSBERG WIKI

Hello, world.

Welcome to the Lionsberg Wiki. We are glad you are here. 

Lionsberg is being purpose-built as a system and gathering place where a community of goodwill can work together on the [[One Thing]] that unites us All. 

We often refer to this as the [[Meta Goal]] of the [[Meta Project]] or the [[Meta Game]]. 

Simply, _we are attempting to inspire a diverse global community to design and build itself so that together we can design and build a better world_. 

Feel free to explore, recognizing that everything here is being built live and transparently as a [[Work In Progress]].
