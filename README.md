# LIONSBERG WIKI

Welcome. We are glad you are here. 

As told in [[The Story of the Builder]], everything about [[Lionsberg]] is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and Lionsberg are putting forward the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]], a [[New Vision and Plan]] for humanity, and a [[Lionsberg System]] purpose-built to bring the [[Vision Into Reality]]. 

Our mission is to connect, inspire, and empower a diverse global community to vanquish corruption and injustice, and design and build the brighter future we all desire. 

## To Get Started

To get started with the Lionsberg Wiki, we would recommend that you visit the [[Above The Chaos]] series, and choose a [[Lionsberg Wiki Books|Lionsberg Wiki Book]] to explore. 

Exploring one of [[Jordan]]'s books will give you a sense for both both work, and the way the Lionsberg Wiki operates. 

[[Jordan's Guide to Lionsberg]] is another starting point, and feel free to also explore [[Ideas and Inspiration to Become More Involved]].
