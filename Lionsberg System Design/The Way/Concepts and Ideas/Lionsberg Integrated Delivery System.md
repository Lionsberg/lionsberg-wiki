# Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System
The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System is Way for individuals, organizations, and communities to transform their energy and action into a _Goal Delivery System._ 

This is critical to producing [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] contained in the [[Meta Goal]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is one integrated [[System of Systems]], that must be co-operated in its entirety to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].  It is not possible for the [[Group Of Groups]] to accomplish [[The Goal]] without this element of the [[System of Systems]]. 

Due to the wide range of experience in [[Program and Process Management]] across the [[Confederation]], we will have to bootstrap this up from a [[Minimum Viable]] [[Starting Point]]. 

Like all other elements of the [[Lionsberg System]], the Integrated Delivery System will need to be brought into Reality in [[Minimum Viable]] form, and then progressively grown, [[Organically Complexified]], and continuously improved over [[Time]].

As a [[Starting Point]], [[Groups]] can begin [[Acting As If]] [[Everything Is A Project]].
