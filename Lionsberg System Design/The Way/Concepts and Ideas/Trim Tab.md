# Trim Tab
On ship rudders or airplane wings, there is a component called a trim tab. 

By adjusting the angle of the small trim tab attached to the larger surface, the vessel can be held steady or steered by properly balancing the surrounding forces. 

Each individual can act as a trim tab to help steer the [[Vessel of Society]].
