# Forging Or Joining A Team

Text below copied from [[II.A. Importance of forming or joining teams]] 

In order to effectively accomplish work, it is important for individuals, organizations, and communities to form or join teams. Teams provide a structure for individuals to work together towards a common goal or objective, leveraging the skills and strengths of each team member to achieve outcomes that would not be possible for any one person to achieve alone.

Working within a team also provides opportunities for individuals to grow and develop their skills, as they collaborate with others, receive feedback, and learn from their experiences. Teams also foster a sense of community and belonging, as individuals work together towards a shared goal, and build relationships with one another.

Additionally, in an integrated delivery system, reliance on functional teams rather than individuals to deliver critical path progress ensures that the weight of the entire program does not rest on the shoulders of any individual, while helping eliminate single points of failure and risk to the shared goals and objectives of the ecosystem. 

In the context of the Lionsberg System of Work, forming or joining teams is particularly important, as the system is designed to integrate the efforts of each team into the larger [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]]. Teams that follow the guidelines and best practices of the Lionsberg System of Work will be able to work more efficiently and effectively, and will have the added benefits of being able to access resources and support from the broader Lionsberg System.

In summary, forming or joining teams is crucial for effectively accomplishing work, personal and professional growth, building community, and accessing resources and support within the Lionsberg System.
