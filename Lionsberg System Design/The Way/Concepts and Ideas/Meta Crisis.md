# Meta Crisis

What if... each of the individual and local crises we were facing, were flowing from the mouth of one overarching and uniting **Meta Crisis**? 

What if... the individual and local crises we are all facing are not the deepest issues, but symptoms of a deeper root cause, what is the deepest root cause? 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that we are in the opening stages of a Meta Crisis that has the potential to massively disrupt life and society on earth. 

We also understand that we have the Agency to co-create whatever future we choose. We are therefore calling for a [[Meta Project]] of historic proportions, in which humanity awakens, arises, and unites to co-create the [[Best Possible Future]] for All by meeting the needs, solving the problems, and capturing the opportunities inherent in this moment in the Story.
