# Remove What Does Not Belong
This is the basic idea that if we are moving towards the [[Best Possible Future]], and we see something that does not belong, we should remove it. 

If it does not exist in the New World, and it exists [[Where We Are]], then we remove it. 

This statement works in paralle with [[Fill Up What Is Lacking]].
