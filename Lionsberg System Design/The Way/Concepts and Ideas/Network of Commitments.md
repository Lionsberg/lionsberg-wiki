# Network of Commitments

A Network of Commitments in a System is a logically ordered series of Commitments, or Actions, that when executed as a [[Process]] creates [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] of the [[System]]. 

On the "Doing" side of the Lionsberg System, it is the fundamental backbone of [[Value]] creation and measurement. 

[[Conscious Agents]] use the [[Planning System]] to determine the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]].

Agents then work together to discern the most [[Efficient Path]] to reach the [[Milestones]]. 

This is called the [[Critical Path]] or [[Critical Chain]].

The [[Critical Path]] is composed of [[Activity|Activities]] that Agents undertake.

Each [[Activity]] has some Activities that logically should happen before it, called [[Predecessor|Predecessors]], and some Activities that logically should happen after it, called [[Successor|Successors]].

The rational links and logic between Activities form the [[Network of Commitments]].

The reason it is called a [[Network of Commitments]] is that an Activity cannot be completed unless an Actor makes and keeps a Commitment to do it. 

Crucially, the Network of Commitments tracks the [[Handoff Points]] between [[Teams]].
