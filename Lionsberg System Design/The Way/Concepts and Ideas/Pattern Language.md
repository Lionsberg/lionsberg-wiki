# Pattern Language

A structured method of communicating and sharing solutions to complex problems, consisting of a collection of patterns that describe best practices, good design, or effective solutions to recurring challenges.
____
A pattern language is a structured method of describing good design solutions to recurring problems. The patterns are organized in a hierarchical manner, such that the patterns at the lower levels of the hierarchy are more specific, while the patterns at the higher levels are more general and overarching. The goal of a pattern language is to provide a shared vocabulary and a set of guidelines that can be used to improve the quality of design, and to make the design process more efficient, effective, and collaborative. The pattern language also allows for design to be more easily and effectively evaluated, as it establishes a standard that can be used to assess the [[Quality]] of a design or local instantiation. 

In architecture, urban design, and software engineering, it describes a practical method for creating coherent, sustainable and livable structures, systems, and communities. In the [[New Vision and Plan]], the pattern language describes a coherent and holistic approach to addressing the [[Meta Crisis]], and creating a more just, sustainable, and harmonious world for all people and all life on Earth. 

The New Vision and Plan uses a pattern language to describe the interconnected components of a [[New World]], in which all elements of life and society are in harmony, balance and in a right relationship. It is a design that lays out a interconnected set of components that work together to form a holistic and harmonious whole. Each pattern in the language describes a problem, its context and a solution, in a format that can be easily understood and replicated by anyone who wishes to apply it. This method of describing a design allows for the New Vision and Plan to be adapted and tailored to different regions, cultures and situations, while still maintaining the overall coherence and integrity of the design. This allows for the [[New World]] to be built in a way that is flexible, adaptable and resilient, making it anti-fragile.
