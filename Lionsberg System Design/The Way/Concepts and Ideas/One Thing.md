# One Thing

The [[Meta Idea]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] and the [[Meta Project]] is that there is **One Thing** that unites us [[All]].  

We intentionally leave the Meta Level abstract rather than concretizing it, but we all have an innate intuition for what it is. 

Perhaps what unites us is (something like) Life and its Source. Perhaps it is (something like) Love. And if we Love All, then perhaps the overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] becomes (someting like): 

*The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness.*

What if we All actually worked together and helped One Another towards that Goal? It would require that we 1) solve the total set of grand challenges 2) accomplish the total set of global goals, and 3) forge the [[Best Possible Future]] in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]]. 

The [[One Thing]] is [[One]] and [[All]].
