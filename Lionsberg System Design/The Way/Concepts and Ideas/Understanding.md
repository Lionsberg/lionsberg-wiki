# Understanding
Understanding relates to the grasp of the meaning, reason, or logic behind what is Known. The ability to [[Comprehend]] not only [[What Is]], but [[How]] and [[Why]] it is. The ability to grasp the [[Nature]] or significance of something. 

It is [[Superordinate]] to [[Knowledge]], and [[Subordinate]] to [[Wisdom]]. 

The value of understanding represents a commitment to seeking knowledge and wisdom. It means being open to new ideas and ways of thinking, and having a desire to learn and understand more about the world around us.
