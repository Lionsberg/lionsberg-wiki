# The Goal

The Goal refers to the single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] that by definition contains within itself and orders all other Goals. 

It can be articulated in terms such as: 

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and [[Right Relationship]] of [[All]] generations of Life and Consciousness._ 

This is our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Aim]] of the [[One]]. The perfect [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] and [[Coherence]] that lies at the end of the [[Logic of Love]].

The biggest single idea to grasp in [[Integrated Program Delivery]] is there is only [[One]] overarching and uniting [[Goal]] of the [[System]].

This One Highest [[Meta Goal]]  contains within itself and orders the total nested hierarchy of all other goals and objectives implied by [[The Goal]].

In the [[Lionsberg System]], the highest overarching and uniting Goal is called the [[Meta Goal]].

The [[Meta Goal]] is the [[One Thing]] that unites [[All]].
