# The Goal

The Goal refers to the single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] that by definition contains within itself and orders all other Goals. 

It can be articulated in terms such as: 

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and [[Right Relationship]] of [[All]] generations of Life and Consciousness._ 

This is our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Aim]] of the [[One]]. The perfect [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] and [[Coherence]] that lies at the end of the [[Logic of Love]].
