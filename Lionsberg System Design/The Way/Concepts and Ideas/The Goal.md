# The Goal

The Goal refers to the single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] that by definition contains within itself and orders all other Goals. 

It can be articulated in terms such as: 

*[[Creator's Intent]]*, or  

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and [[Right Relationship]] of [[All]] generations of Life and Consciousness._ 

It is a [[Vision]] and [[Aim]] of [[Perfection]]; the [[Ideal]]; the will and intention of the [[One]]. 

At the [[Highest Level of Abstraction]], [[The Goal]] is Ultimately [[God]] (transcendent / eternal / universal), or a few [[Levels of Abstraction]] down, the Kingdom / Will / Intention of God, manifest here on Earth as it is in Heaven (manifest / temporal / local). 

We are progressing towards [[Heaven On Earth]].

The biggest single idea to grasp in [[Integrated Program Delivery]] is there is only [[One]] overarching and uniting [[Goal]] of the [[System]].

This One Highest [[Meta Goal]]  contains within itself and orders the total nested hierarchy of all other goals and objectives implied by [[The Goal]].

In the [[Lionsberg System]], the highest overarching and uniting Goal is called the [[Meta Goal]].

The [[Meta Goal]] is the [[One Thing]] that unites [[All]].

By definition, it must be [[One]].
