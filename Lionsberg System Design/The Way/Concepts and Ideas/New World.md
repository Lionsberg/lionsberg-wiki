# New World

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[New World]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the [[Best Possible Future]] we are moving towards. 

It is used in contrast to the [[Old World]], which is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the corrupt, broken, dysfunctional, and unjust elements of the past we are leaving behind. 

FROM the [[Old]], TO the [[New]]. 

The [[New World]] is [[Where We Are Going]]. 

Behold, we are making [[All]] things [[New]].
