# Way of Being

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Way of Being]] and [[Way of Doing]] are used as [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] to point towards the two reciprocating elements of our Lives. 

Our [[Way of Being]] is the Way in which we Are in the world. It can be thought of as the spirit, quality, essence, or energy with which we exist and [[Interact]]. 

From this flows our [[Way of Doing]]. 

Our [[Way of Being]] and our [[Way of Doing]] are somewhat arbitrary differentiations of One unified [[Way]] of InterExistence.  

In the [[Lionsberg System]], progressing towards [[The Goal]] requires that we progressively elevate, transform, and conform our [[Way]] towards the perfect, universal, eternal [[Way]] of the [[One]]. 

This is the central movement of the [[All]] towards [[Unity]] through [[Love]].
