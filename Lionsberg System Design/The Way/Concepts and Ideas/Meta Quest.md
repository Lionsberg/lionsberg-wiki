# Meta Quest

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta Quest** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Quest of quests", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible quests.

The idea of the **Meta Quest** is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual Quests with the **Meta Quest** that is big enough to unite us [[All]].  

Because the word [[Meta]] in the System points towards the [[Absolute]], it is intentionally not concretized. This is to avoid the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that occurs when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]]. 

Success in the Meta Quest is measured in terms of progress towards the [[Meta Goal]].
