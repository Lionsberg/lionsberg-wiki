# Freedom
[[Freedom]] refers to the right of an Agent to exist, think, speak and act without external hinderance or restraint. 

The value of freedom represents a commitment to personal liberty and autonomy. It means having the ability to make one's own choices and decisions, and being able to act on them without interference as long as they do not harm or hinder others.
