# Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals
The [[Lionsberg System]] is rooted in the concept that there is One highest overarching and uniting Goal. We call this the [[Meta Goal]]. 

The [[Meta Goal]] by definition contains within itself and orders a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. 

In other words, in order for us to experience _the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of Life and Consciousness_... an entire set of sub-goals has to be accomplished. 

While this is intentionally left abstract and not concretized, a close approximation can be found in articulations like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that were ratified by 193 member nations, and represent broad human consensus. 

They include articulations like: 

1. No Poverty  
2. Zero Hunger  
3. Health and Wellbeing  
4. Quality Education  
5. Gender Equality  
6. Clean Water and Sanitation  
7. Affordable and Accessible Clean Energy  
8. Meaningful Work and Economic Growth 
9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure  
10. Reduced Inequalities  
11. Sustainable Cities and Communities  
12. Responsible Consumption and Production  
13. Climate Action  
14. Flourishing Life Below Water  
15. Flourishing Life on Land  
16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions  
17. Partnerships For The Goals  

We could add to these Goals a few more obvious ones precluded by political process, such as: 
18. Elimination of Corruption, Injustice, and Oppression   
19. Accountability and Transparency  
20. Elimination of Toxins and Pollution  of Air, Water, and Land  

At the highest levels of abstraction, we know that anyone who Loved a child would want for them to be free from poverty, hunger, violence, injustice, inequality, sickness, want, ignorance, thirst, filth, darkness, disempowerment, meaningless or demeaning work, unsustainability, irresponsible consumption and production, a denegrating Living System, degenerating Life in water or on land, violence, injustice, weak / corrupt institutions, and a lack of co-operation. 

All these Goals are contained within, implied by, and ordered by a single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]], which is simply what any heart of Love would desire: for all Life and Consciousness to develop into the fullness of its [[Potential]] and Flourish in Harmony. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals arises largely in responses to the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] and problems inherent in any Community of Life. 

While they are a wonderful starting point, the application and implementation of these Goals is a significant challenge. 

Critically, new metrics and measurements are needed to ensure that the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is accomplished, and the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] solved, in a way that is eternally regenerative in nature and in perfect accordance with the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]]. 

This would require that all Individuals and Localities progressing towards the Global Goals achieve that progress in a Way that, if All other Individuals and Localities operated in that same Way, would cause All Life and Consciousness to Flourish. 

This would require that "Progress" made according to [[Means]] which do not cohere with the [[Ends]] we are trying to achieve would be discounted / discarded as [[Waste]] rather than [[Value]]. 

It would also require liberation from inadquate definitions and standards of Poverty, which are currently measured by international institutions at levels far below that which would support a Quality and Dignity of Life that the vast majority of us would desired for [[One We Love]]. 

This higher order framework and philosophy is critically lacking in current international efforts to measure progress towards the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]].  

To our [[Current Best Understanding]], this has not yet been accomplished, which is why we are developing the [[Lionsberg System]] as a Prototype.
