# Potential

Unrealized or latent possibility / capability / capacity. 

[[Potential]] is (something like) the total set of all possibilities that could be [[Realized]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is specifically built to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]], or the [[Best Possible Future]], or the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. 

Each of these are equivalent, and require the fullness of the [[Potential]] present in [[All]] to be [[Realize|Realized]]. 

This happens from the bottom-up through the self-realization of Potential within each Participant.
