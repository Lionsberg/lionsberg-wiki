# Time Currency
Work in Progess: 

Time Currency is a concept arising from the [[Meta Game]]. 

It breaks the Time freely given to every Individual every day down into 15 minute increments, and proposes those 15 minute [[Periods of Action]] as a fundamental and equal basis of exchange among Conscious Agents in the Game.
