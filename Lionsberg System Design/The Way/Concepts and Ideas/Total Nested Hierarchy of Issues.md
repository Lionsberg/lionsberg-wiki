# Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues
Inherent in every Community of Life is a Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues that must be solved if the elements of Community are to develop into the fullness of their [[Potential]] and Flourish in Harmony. 

This is not an Absolute list, but the general themes are obvious. If we loved someone, we would want to address the inherent issues of: 

1. Poverty  
2. Hunger  
3. Thirst 
4. Filth  
5. Pollution  
7. Violence  
8. Corruption  
9. Injustice  
10. Oppression  
11. War
12. Inequality  
13. Sickness  
14. Want  
15. Ignorance  
16. Fear
17. Disempowerment  
18. Meaningless or Demeaning Work  
19. Unsustainability  
20. Irresponsible Production and Consumption  
21. Addiction  
22. Actions that Harm or Degenerate Life in the Water, on Land, or in the Air  
23. Lack of accountability, transparency, and truth  
24. Weak / corrupt institutions  
25. Lack of coherence, cooperation, and continuity 
26. Lack of Spiritual Realization 
27. Supply Chains, extraction, oppression, and abuse  
28. Cyclical catastrophes that render much of Earth uninhabitable.  

These issues, and their corresponding Goals, have been nearly universally validated by 193 nations and the vast majority of international organizations and institutions through frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

If we look at any Organization, we could develop a similar hierarchy of issues. 

If we look at any Individual, we could develop a similar hierarchy of issues. 

In short, a heart of Love would want for all things to develop into the fullness of their Potential and Flourish in Harmony. 

The vast majority of Issues that any Individual, Organization, or Community faces are [[General Issues]] and [[General Problems]] common to All. 

If we developed [[General Solutions]] to these issues, problems, and challenges we would not need to continually "reinvent the wheel", and could instead cause the solutions available to All to [[Become]] [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues gives rise to a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. Goals are the positive expression of what can or should be done in response to the problems or desires we are facing. 

The [[Meta Project]] and [[Meta System]] exist to ensure that this [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is accomplished for the Good of All. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is being co-created to instantiate / embody these solutions. 

___
To evaluate the parts of the prototype, we synthesized comprehensive lists of the challenges and opportunities facing humanity and life on earth. 

As we look at the many challenges facing the world today, it can be overwhelming to consider the complexity and interconnectedness of these issues. From poverty and hunger, to conflict and environmental degradation, to corruption and injustice, it is clear that no single challenge exists in isolation. To effectively address these global challenges, it is critical to approach them from a systems point of view, considering the root causes and interdependencies that contribute to these issues. By understanding the bigger picture, we can identify key leverage points and prioritize solutions that address the underlying systematic causes rather than just the symptoms. This approach can help us to forge more effective and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of global challenges and work towards a more just and equitable world for all.

Challenges identified included issues such as: 


1. Problem:

67. **Uneven distribution of resources, knowledge, and technologies**: The unequal distribution of resources, knowledge, and technologies can lead to imbalances in economic development and opportunities and can perpetuate inequalities between countries and within societies. Addressing these imbalances and promoting more equitable access to resources, knowledge, and technologies can be a key factor in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty and inequality.  
68. **Short-term thinking**: Short-term thinking, or a focus on immediate rather than long-term consequences, can be a major challenge in addressing complex global issues. It can lead to a lack of investment in long-term solutions and a failure to anticipate and plan for future challenges. Promoting a long-term perspective and considering the long-term impacts of decisions and actions can be important in addressing global challenges effectively.  
69. **Misallocation of non-profit resources**: The annual misallocation of hundreds of billions of dollars of resources within the non-profit sector, whether due to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, lack of knowledge, lack of coordination, or other factors, is preventing the private sector from achieving their shared goals and having the maximum impact. Ensuring that non-profit resources are used effectively and efficiently is important in order to address global challenges and achieve positive change. 
70. **Misallocation of government resources**: The misallocation of government resources, whether due to inefficiencies, corruption, or other factors, can prevent governments from effectively addressing the needs of their citizens and achieving their goals. Ensuring that government resources are used effectively and efficiently is important in order to address global challenges and achieve positive change.  
71. **Lack of systems thinking**: The lack of systems thinking, or the inability to understand and consider the interconnectedness of different systems and factors, can be a major challenge in addressing complex global issues. It can lead to a focus on individual problems or symptoms rather than addressing root causes, and can result in ineffective or even counterproductive solutions. Incorporating systems thinking into decision-making and problem-solving can be important in addressing local and global challenges effectively. 
72. **Unaccountable national and international bureaucracies**: National and international bureaucracies, or the administrative systems and processes of governments and other organizations, can sometimes be opaque, unresponsive, or unaccountable, leading to issues such as corruption, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency. Ensuring that bureaucracies are accountable and responsive to the needs of citizens and stakeholders can be important in addressing global challenges and promoting good governance.
73. **Disproportionate influence of national superpowers in international institutions**: The disproportionate power of national superpowers in international institutions, such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others, can prevent other countries from effectively participating in global decision-making and can perpetuate inequalities. Ensuring that the power and influence is properly balanced in international institutions is key to addressing global challenges and promoting equitable and sustainable governance and development for all communities. 
74. **Corruption of religious leaders**: The corruption of religious leaders by governmental and economic forces, who encourage them to use their positions of religious authority to unduly influence the thinking of the populations, can undermine the integrity of religious institutions and hinder the promotion of ethical values. Protecting the independence and integrity of religious leaders and institutions from outside interference can be important in addressing global challenges and promoting just and fair societies. 
75. **Supply chain challenges**: There are many challenges and issues related to supply chains that can impact their sustainability and effectiveness.
