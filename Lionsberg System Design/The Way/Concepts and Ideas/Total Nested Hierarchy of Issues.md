# Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues
Inherent in every Community of Life is a Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues that must be solved if the elements of Community are to develop into the fullness of their [[Potential]] and Flourish in Harmony. 

This is not an Absolute list, but the general themes are obvious. If we loved someone, we would want to address the inherent issues of: 

1. Poverty  
2. Hunger  
3. Thirst 
4. Filth  
5. Pollution  
7. Violence  
8. Corruption  
9. Injustice  
10. Oppression  
11. Inequality  
12. Sickness  
13. Want  
14. Ignorance  
15. Disempowerment  
16. Meaningless or Demeaning Work  
17. Unsustainability  
18. Irresponsible Production and Consumption  
19. Addiction  
20. Actions that Harm or Degenerate Life in the Water, on Land, or in the Air  
21. Lack of accountability, transparency, and truth  
22. Weak / corrupt institutions  
23. Lack of coherence, cooperation, and continuity 

These issues, and their corresponding Goals, have been nearly universally validated by 193 nations and the vast majority of international organizations and institutions through frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 

If we look at any Organization, we could develop a similar hierarchy of issues. 

If we look at any Individual, we could develop a similar hierarchy of issues. 

In short, a heart of Love would want for all things to develop into the fullness of their Potential and Flourish in Harmony. 

The vast majority of Issues that any Individual, Organization, or Community faces are [[General Issues]] and [[General Problems]] common to All. 

If we developed [[General Solutions]] to these issues, problems, and challenges we would not need to continually "reinvent the wheel", and could instead cause the solutions available to All to [[Get A Little Better Every Day]]. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues gives rise to a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. Goals are the positive expression of what can or should be done in response to the problems or desires we are facing. 

The [[Meta Project]] and [[Meta System]] exist to ensure that this [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is accomplished for the Good of All. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is being co-created to instanitate / embody these solutions.
