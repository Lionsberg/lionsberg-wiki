# Current Best Understanding
[[Knowledge]] in the [[Lionsberg System]] System is organized through the lens of a [[Meta Science]] that reflects our [[Current Best Understanding]], with the humble acknowledgement that it is partial and incomplete at best. 

This element of the System is critical for two reasons: 

First, because it prevents any of the conflicting stories, narratives, and understandings of the [[Old World]] from being imported into the System as if they were Absolute. 

Second, because by admitting [[We Do Not Know]] we simultaneously create the space and freedom for each individual to genuinely express and grapple with their [[Current Best Understanding]] in a safe and supportive environment.
