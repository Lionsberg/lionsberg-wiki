# Love
In the [[Lionsberg System]], Love is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the [[Ineffable]], Ultimate, [[Absolute]], Highest Unconditional energetic relationship possible between two things. 

It is akin to the use of [[Agape]] Love in Christian theology, or the Jewish notion of [[Chesed]], which describe the ultimate and unconditional Love of [[One]] for [[All]]. 

It is differentiated from and transcendent of the sexual, brotherly, or romantic loves we often associate the [[Word Tool]] with.  

Beyond these, it points to a [[Frequency of Being]] that regards the [[One We Love]] with (something like) unconditional affection, [[Goodwill]], and positive desire directed towards the fullness of their unique [[Potential]]. 

Love longs for the [[One We Love]] to develop into the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish. 

It sees in them the fullness of all they could possibly become, beyond who they presently are, and then moves beyond mere longing into powerful action to help them bring forth and manifest the fullness of that [[Potential]]. 

It is passionately committed not only to the wellbeing of what is, but to the highest [[Potential]] of what could be. 

It calls up. It urges on. It comes to the aid. It encourages. It hopes. It persists. It endures. It forgives. It is kind. It is merciful. It is Just. It is Good. 

It gives freely of itself, expecting nothing in return. It gives without precondition. 

It longs for but is not conditional upon reciprocity. 

The natural response to this kind of Absolute and Unconditional Love is to reciproctate it. 

Therefore, as [[One]] Loves [[All]], so too should [[All]] strive to embody One's Love in return towards [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]]. 

This is the [[Universal Law]], and the single overarching and uniting design principle of the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

[[Love]] [[One Another]].
