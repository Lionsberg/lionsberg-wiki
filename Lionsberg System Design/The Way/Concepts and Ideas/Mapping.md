# Mapping
We use "mapping" to mean the collection and collation of a set of data -- for instance, projects and some information about them, including project participants.

The collected data, in a database, is a "map" of projects we know about.

Then, various visualizations -- tabular reports, graph network visualizations, geolocated positions -- can be generated from the data.

We note the difference between our use of "map" to mean data + visualizations, and the common meaning of "map", which is generally a visual representation, particularly of geography, often without a separate data table or database.

A core element of the [[Lionsberg System]] is [[Interoperability]] among a growing diversity of of expressions. This requires very careful focus on the underlying data models, so that they can be brought to light in many different cultures, in many different ways, for many different purposes.
