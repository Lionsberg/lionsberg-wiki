# Doing Our Best
When the Standard and Goal is [[Absolute]], we cannot measure ourselves against it without being crushed by the weight of its Judgment. 

Therefore as we strive towards Perfection, we do not measure ourselves against the Absolute, but by our [[Progress]]. 

From a coaching perspective, two of the most powerful tools are: 

1. Ask yourself a series of questions daily, that begin with Did I Do My Best To (fill in the blank)? 

For example: 
- Did I Do My Best To: manage my total nested hierarchy of relationships with integrity?  
- Did I Do My Best To: demonstrate unconditional Love to my loved ones?  
- Did I Do My Best To: Live in Integrity and Right Relationship to [[One]] and [[All]]?  

2. As you evaluate [[Progress]], do not measure yourself against the Absolute. Rather, measure your [[Progress]] and [[Continuous Improvement]] over time. 

These two paradigms, [[Doing Our Best]] and [[Becoming]] [[A Little Better Every Day]], result in the aggregation of marginal gains over time to reap the exponential benefits of compounding.
