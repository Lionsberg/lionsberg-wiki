# Meta Fund
The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore **Meta Fund** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Fund of funds", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible funds.

The idea of the [[Meta Fund]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our various individual funds, with the conceptual [[Meta Fund]] that is big enough to unite us [[All]].  

All of our resources, whether we acknowledge it or not, are part of the total set of resources available to humanity and the Living System. The question is how consciously and competently we are deploying them, individually and collectively.
