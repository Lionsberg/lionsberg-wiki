# Story of Lionsberg
The [[Story of Lionsberg]] is the story of an epic Quest out of the bondage and suffering of the [[Old World]], into an entirely regenerated [[New World]]. 

To dive into the mythical Story, and find your place in it, see [[The Book of Lionsberg]].

In short: 

## Who We Are 

[[Lionsberg]] is a mythological name for the [[New World]] we are co-creating, and the Community that is co-creating it.  

We chose a mythical name because a Story is the only thing capable of scaling to 8 billion people in 7 years. 

[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is the primary steward of the Source Idea, in concert with dozens of co-creators. 

## Where We Are

As of winter 2022, we are shifting FROM building the Lionsberg platform and infrastructure while exploring the [[Meta Project]] in the abstract, TO beginning to identify, connect, and empower small groups around the world. 

Our hypothesis is that this should be done in the form of a Game so simple and powerful, everyone can help one another play it. 

Therefore in November 2022, we introduced [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]. 

## How We Got Here 

As a builder of heavy civil infrastructure, Jordan spent his career organizing and empowering teams to: 

1. Thoroughly understand the Architect's Intent / [[Designer's Intent]]  
2. Thoroughly analyze and understand the existing forces and conditions bearing on a worksite  
3. Transform the physical world to bring [[Intention Into Reality]]  

We are attempting to apply this same approach towards transforming [[Worksite Earth]] in its entirety within a single generation.   

This will require a transformation of our [[Way of Being]] as a human species on planet earth, which will follow an underlying shift in consciousness / paradigm FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]]. 

After combining lifetimes of work and wisdom to discern a plan that _might work_, Jordan and allies have been working on the critical path infrastructure, process, and technology for about 5 years (2017 to 2022) to prepare for this time. 

## Where We Are Going 

[[Where We Are Going]] as a human species is the entire issue. 

We have a serious [[Navigation Issue]] with more than we can imagine at stake. 

From [[Where We Are]], it is possible for things to get a loss worse, approaching the [[Hell On Earth]] that likely lies at the end of our current trajectory and logic. 

The good news is that in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]], we can change that trajectory. 

From [[Where We Are]], it is possible for things to get unimaginably better, approaching a [[Heaven On Earth]] that is already perfect, and continuing to get better every day as we work together to make it so. 

See [[Core Vision]] and [[Best Possible Future]] for more articulated information on our [[Aim]]. 

## How We Will Get There 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that nearly all the work required to meet the needs, solve the problems, and Co-Create the [[New World]] will happen in small autonomous groups of 3 to 20 people. 

Therefore we have created a Story, Platform, and Game to  connect up and empower a distributed confederation of sovereign and autonomous groups. 

Our near term [[Aim]] is to connect 1 billion groups to the platform within 7 years, completing the tipping point adoption strategy prior to 2030. 

## Why? 

A house divided and warring against itself with every more powerful weapons will always fail and fall. 

The human species is currently divided against itself and the world and the [[One]] that creates and sustains us. 

This is the best plan we can come up with to help humanity avoid [[Hell On Earth]], and progressively realize [[Heaven On Earth]] for the Good of [[All]]. 

_It might work._
