# Meta Model

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Game of games", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible games.

The idea of the [[Meta Project]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual projects, with the various projects we participate in, with the [[Meta Project]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

Our **Meta Model** will necessarily have to start with the [[One Thing]], advance to the [[Reality]], and then map [[Reality]] into [[Spacetime]] where we can make predictions and test it. 

This is a critical step towards liberating ourselves from the perceived limitations of [[Spacetime]].
