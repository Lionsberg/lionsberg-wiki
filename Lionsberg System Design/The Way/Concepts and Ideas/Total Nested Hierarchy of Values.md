In the [[Lionsberg System]], power is not viewed as a value or goal in and of itself, but rather as neutral and subordinate tool or potential  must be cultivated developed wisely and as only as necessary to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].

Power may never be used violate the [[Free Will]] of others in their [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]].
