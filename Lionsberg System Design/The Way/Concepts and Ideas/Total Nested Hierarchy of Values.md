# Total Nested Hierarchy of Values
Coming soon. 

For a discussion on Values, see [[Values]]. 

Briefly: 

To harmonize ourselves with One Another, the Living System, and the One Thing that unites All things, we pledge to do our best to uphold our shared universal values. 

At various levels of detail and abstraction, these can be described with words like: 

- The [[Meta Value]] / One / Love  
____
- Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom. 
___
- Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, Humility, Self-Control, Non-Harm.  
___
- Agency, Autonomy, Competence, Conscientiousness, Respect, Dignity, Happiness, Creativity, Freedom, Curiosity, Adventure, Understanding, Beauty, Enjoyment, Freedom from Fear, Honesty, Forgiveness, Loyalty, Responsibility, Fellowship, Friendship, Tradition, Moderation, Cleanliness, Security, Reciprocity, Wellbeing, Belonging, Spirituality, Purpose, Meaning, Compassion, Regeneration, Recreation, Independence, Community, Service, Hope, Perseverance, Gratitude, Generosity, Courage. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Values can be derived from [[One]] / [[Love]]. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Values results in a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], that emerge in response to a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]].
