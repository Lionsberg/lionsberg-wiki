# Human System
The total set of all Human Beings and Human activity. 

The Human System is nested _within_ the higher order [[Living System]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed to reintegrate the total [[Human System]] within the [[Living System]] that contains it, in the conceptual context of a single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta System]].
