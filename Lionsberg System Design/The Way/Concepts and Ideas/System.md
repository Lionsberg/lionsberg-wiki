# System
A [[System]] is a network of elements that [[Interact]] and [[Interrelate]], according to a set of Principles / Processes / Rules, to form a unified Whole. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] looks at the universe as a single interrelated Whole, and invites us to progressively discover and [[Act As If]] that were True. 

From that standpoint, it seeks to forge and embody a [[Human System]] that is entirely reintegrated with and in service of the [[Living System]], in the context of a highest overarching and uniting [[Meta System]]. 

The System is cohered and unified by the [[One]] [[Deepest Thing]].
