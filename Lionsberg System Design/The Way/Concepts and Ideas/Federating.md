# Federating

In the Lionsberg System, "Federating" refers to the process of bringing together individuals, organizations, and communities into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. This process is aimed at creating a higher order system that is capable of effectively addressing the needs and challenges faced as part of the Quest towards our shared Vision and Goals.

Federating plays a crucial role in the Lionsberg System, as it enables [[Participant|Participants]] to work together in a collaborative and adaptive manner, aligning their resources and efforts towards the shared Vision and Goals. By federating, Participants form a global [[Team of Teams]], leveraging their collective skills, knowledge, and expertise to achieve the desired outcomes.

Through federating, the Lionsberg System is able to build a robust, scalable, and highly adaptable system that is capable of producing [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] implied in the uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

This helps to ensure that all Participants are working together towards a common purpose and that the system is continuously improving and adapting to changing needs and circumstances. By bringing together diverse perspectives and resources into a federated model, the Lionsberg System is able to achieve results that would not be possible through the efforts of individual Participants alone.
