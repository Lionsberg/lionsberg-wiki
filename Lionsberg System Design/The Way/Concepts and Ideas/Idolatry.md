# Idolatry
Idolatry refers to the [[Sin]] / [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] of [[Concretizing The Absolute]]. 

In other words, creating something (a form, an image, a set of propositions), and setting those up in place of the [[One]]. 

This is very common in systems of religion in the [[Old World]], in which Authorities establish sets of written propositions or beliefs, and demand that individuals "bow down" or subordinate their spiritual and intellectual will to the Authorities and their Propositions. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], the [[One]] Ultimate Reality That Creates and Sustains [[All]] Life and Consciousness is related to as the fundamental mystery, that can and must be rightly related to with humility, but never be fully comprehended. 

[[Knowledge]] in the System is organized through the lens of a [[Meta Science]] that reflects our [[Current Best Understanding]], with the humble acknowledgement that it is partial and incomplete at best. 

Grappling with the [[Absolute]] as a eternal and ineffable mystery, while still aiming at it and trying to [[Get A Little Better Every Day]] as we progress towards It, is the antidote to the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] of Idolatry.
