# All
All things, equally and without exception. 

The concept of **All** couples with the [[Meta Idea]], which is that there is [[One Thing]] that unites and orders **All** things within Itself. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[All]] is used to contrast, compliment, and complete the concept and Reality of [[One]].
