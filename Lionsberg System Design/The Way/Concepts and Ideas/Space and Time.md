# Space and Time

[[Space and Time]], or [[Spacetime]], refers to both to our our perceptions of space and time, and to the mathematical models that combine three dimensions of space and one dimension of time into a four-dimensional manifold. 

It is critical to understand that our perceived [[Spacetime]], and the associated mathematical models, are _not fundamental_. 

One can intuitively think of [[Spacetime]] as a simplified user interface that we use to interact with the fundamental underlying [[Reality]]. 

At the [[Meta]] level of analysis, it is critically important that we are striving to actually interact with underlying [[Reality]], and not only our simplified spacial and temporal representation of it. 

Our [[Meta Model]] will necessarily have to start with the [[One Thing]], advance to the [[Reality]] emerging from it, and then map [[Reality]] into [[Spacetime]] where we can make predictions and test it. 

This is a critical step towards liberating ourselves from the perceived limitations of [[Spacetime]].
