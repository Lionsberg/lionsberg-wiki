# Integration And Alignment Of Resources And Power
Whereas that we are beings in motion, and there is work to be done, and work demands power and resources to accomplish it...

And whereas if power and resources become the Goal we destroy our Selves, our Right Relationship, and our world...

We pledge to only develop as much power and resources as are necessary to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

We pledge to integrate and align the fullness of any power, leadership, or resources entrusted to us in service of [[One]], [[All]], and the [[The Goal]], to Help, and not to Harm.
