# Integration And Alignment Of Resources And Power

Whereas we are beings in motion, and there is work to be done, and work demands power and resources to accomplish it...

We pledge to only develop as much power and resources as are necessary to accomplish [[The Goal]], and to use [[Minimum Necessary Force]]. 

We pledge to integrate and align the fullness of any power, leadership, or resources entrusted to us in service of [[One]], [[All]], and the [[The Goal]], to Help, and not to Harm.
