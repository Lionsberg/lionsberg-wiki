# Best Possible Future
Of all the potential Futures that we could pull into Reality, which one lies at the absolute top, as the Best Possible Future, or what we might call the Meta Future in the Lionsberg System? 

Like everything else at this [[Meta Level]] of abstraction, this takes us into the realm beyond concrete propositions and knowledge. It takes us into the realm of images, dreams, and imaginations. 

And even at the out edges of our imagination, we can be certain that what is possible is _exceedingly and abundantly beyond all we could ask or imagine._ 

But let's explore the [[Configuration Space]] / [[Creative Field]] to see what might be possible. 

If we can develop a conceptul intuition for it that is at least close to the Goal, and then Aim unwaveringly at it and begin progressing towards it, we can improve our Vision and Aim over time as we [[Get A Little Better Every Day]].  

If on the other hand we fail to develop a Vision and Aim for it, we will perish wandering in the desert that lies between [[Where We Are]] and [[Where We Are Going]]. 

This is an opening Vision that we can begin to improve together as discover how to [[Fill Up What Is Lacking]], and [[Remove What Does Not Belong]]. 

## A Working Vision For The Best Possible Future 
One of the first ways we can begin developing our Vision of the Best Possible Future for All is to remember what the prophets and sages have aleady imagined or been shown. 

An even simpler Way is hold a single uniting and defining design criteria or theme in [[Mind]]: [[Love]]. 

If we Love, we desire a future that is as close to Heaven on Earth as possible.

So given [[Where We Are]], how do we get to [[Where We Are Going]]? How can we possibly cross the chasm that lies between the Old World of captivity and the Land of Promise? 

Simply, we _choose_. We _decide_ to insist upon and Aim unwaveringly at the Best Possible Future for All, and we strive together daily towards that end in partnership with [[One]] and [[One Another]]. 

If it is what [[One]] intends, and we Aim for it and align the fullness of our Being with it, what could possibly stand in our Way? 

More pragmatically, we are doing our best to Co-Create a Meta Community, a Meta Project, and a Meta Game to help guide and empower you on our shared Quest towards the [[Most Worthy Goal]].
