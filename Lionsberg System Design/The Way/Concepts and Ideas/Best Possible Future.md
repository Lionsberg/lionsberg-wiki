# Best Possible Future
Of all the potential Futures that we could pull into Reality, which one lies at the absolute top, as the Best Possible Future? 

Like everything else at this [[Meta Level]] of abstraction, this takes us into the realm beyond concrete propositions and knowledge. It takes us into the realm of images, dreams, and imaginations. 

We can be certain that what is possible is _exceedingly and abundantly beyond all we could ask or imagine._ 

Let's explore the [[Configuration Space]] / [[Creative Field]] to see what might be possible. 

If we can develop a conceptual intuition for it that is at least close to [[The Goal]], and then Aim unwaveringly at it and begin progressing towards it, we can improve our [[Vision]], our [[Aim]], and our [[Reality]] over time as we get [[A Little Better Every Day]].  

If we fail to develop a Vision and Aim for it, we will perish wandering in the desert that lies between [[Where We Are]] and [[Where We Are Going]]. 

This is an opening Vision that we can begin to improve together as discover how to [[Filling Up What Is Lacking|Fill Up What Is Lacking]], and [[Removing What Does Not Belong|Remove What Does Not Belong]]. 

## A Working Vision For The Best Possible Future 
One of the first ways we can begin developing our Vision of the Best Possible Future for All is to remember what the prophets and sages have aleady imagined or been shown. 

An even simpler Way is hold a single uniting and defining design criteria or theme in [[Mind]]: [[Love]]. 

If we Love, we desire a future that is as close to Heaven on Earth as possible.
