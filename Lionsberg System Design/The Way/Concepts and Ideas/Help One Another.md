# Help One Another
The single unifying design principle of Lionsberg is [[Love]]. 

If we [[Love One Another]], we [[Doing Our Best|Do Our Best]] to [[Help One Another]], and not [[Harm One Another]]. 

If [[All]] things [[Love One Another]] and [[Help One Another]], great synergies are unleashed in the System of Systems as [[All]] things help [[All]] things rise towards the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish in harmony.
