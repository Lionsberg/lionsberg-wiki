# Retrospective

A core element of the [[Lionsberg System]] is the mandate to [[Get A Little Better Every Day]]. 

This is the basic principle behind [[Continuous Learning]] / [[Continuous Improvement]] / [[Continous Elevation]]. 

The primary way that individuals, teams, organizations, and communities grow and improve is through the intentional practice of pausing to reflect, learn, and grow. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], we call this process a [[Retrospective]]. 

See [[6.24 Retrospectives]] in the [[Governance Guide]].
