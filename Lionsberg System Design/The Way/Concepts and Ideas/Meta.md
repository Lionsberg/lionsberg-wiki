# Meta

The word **Meta** as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, all encompassing, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

For example, we could speak of:

The [[Meta Story]]: the highest universal overarching and uniting "Story of stories", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible stories.

The [[Meta Intention]]: the highest universal overarrching and uniting "Intention of intentions", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible intentions.

The [[Meta Goal]]: the highest universal overarching and uniting "Goal of goals", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible goals.

The [[Meta Project]]: the highest universal overarching and uniting "project of projects", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible projects.

The [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]]: the highest universal overarching and uniting "Game of games", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible games.

It is critical to note that *by definition*, the intention, object, or goal of the [[Meta Project]] or [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game]] could not be anything other than the [[Meta Goal]].

This is because [[All]] are fundamentally and functionally unified by [[One Thing]].
