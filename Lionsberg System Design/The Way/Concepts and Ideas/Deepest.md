# Deepest

The concept of "deepest" is derived from the term "depth", which refers to how fundamental or underlying something is to other things that depend on it. In the context of the [[Lionsberg System]], the concept of "depth" is used to describe the amount of other things that depend on a particular level of abstraction.

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that there is [[One]] deepest thing that all other things depend on. This deepest thing is sometimes referred to as the "deepest level of abstraction", and is equivalent to what other philosophical traditions might refer to as the [[Uncaused Cause]], [[Source]], [[Creator]], or [[God]]. In the Lionsberg System, this concept is often referred to as [[One]], in contrast to [[All]] things that depend upon It. 

The idea of "deepest" is closely related to the idea of "highest", as both concepts refer to fundamental and underlying aspects of Reality. However, in the context of the Lionsberg System, "deepest" is specifically used to refer to the most fundamental and underlying aspect of reality, while "highest" is used to refer to the most elevated or transcendent aspect of reality. These are both [[One]]. 

In practical terms, the concept of "deepest" has important implications for how we understand the nature of reality and our place within it. By recognizing that there is [[One]] single deepest level of abstraction, an [[Ultimate Reality]] that all other levels depend on, we can better understand the interdependence of [[All]] things and work towards a more integrated and harmonious understanding and operation of the world.

The concept of [[Depth]] is an important part of the Lionsberg System's framework, and provides a useful tool for understanding the nature of reality and our place within it.
