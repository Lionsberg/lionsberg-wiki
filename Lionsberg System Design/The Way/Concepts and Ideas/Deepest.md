# Deepest
Deepest is derived from "depth", which refers to how far "down" something is. 

As used in the [[Lionsberg System]], the concept of [[Depth]] refers to the amount of other things that depend upon something. 

The Lionsberg System is based on our [[Current Best Understanding]] that there is [[One]] deepest thing that [[All]] other things depend upon. 

In other philosophical language, the [[Deepest Thing]] would be pointed to with phrases such as the [[Uncaused Cause]], [[Source]], or [[God]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg]] system, It is simply refered to as [[One]], in contrast to [[All]]. 

In this sense, Deepest is philosophically equivalent to Highest. 

The Deepest and Highest things are [[One]].
