# Meta Story

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the [[Meta Story]] is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Story of stories", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible stories.

The idea of the [[Meta Story]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual stories, with the stories of the various things we participate in, with the [[Meta Story]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

For a quick approximation, see [[0.4 The Meta Story]].
