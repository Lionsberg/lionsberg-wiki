# Meta Story

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the [[Meta Story]] is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Story of stories", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible stories.

The idea of the [[Meta Story]] is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual stories, with the stories of the various things we participate in, with the [[Meta Story]] that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

For a quick approximation, see [[0.4 The Meta Story]].

The Meta Story is the overarching narrative that connects all of humanity and guides us towards a better future. It is a story of hope, of courage, and of determination to overcome the challenges that stand in the way of a flourishing and abundant world for all. Each person's story fits into the Meta Story as a unique and essential piece of the puzzle, contributing their talents, skills, and experiences to the greater whole. Together, we are co-creating a new future that is shaped by our shared values, visions, and commitments to making the world a better place for all. The Meta Story is an ongoing process of discovery, learning, and growth, as we each do our part to make a positive impact on the world around us.
