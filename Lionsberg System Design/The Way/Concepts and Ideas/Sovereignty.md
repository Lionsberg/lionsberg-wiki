# Sovereignty

[[Sovereignty]] refers to the ultimate power or authority to [[Governance|Govern]] one's Self. 

It affords [[Autonomy]], which in conjunction with [[Agency]] is crucial to the capacity of [[Conscious Agent|Conscious Agents]] to co-create Reality.  

[[Sovereignty]] does not begin with a Ruler, a Nation State, or a Corporation.  

The locus of [[Sovereignty]] and inherent Divine worth lies inalienably with the [[Individuals|Individual]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] dispenses with the abstractions, [[Categories]], [[Classes]] and power structures of the [[Old World]], and recognizes the inherent worth, dignity, and Sovereignty of each Individual and locality.
