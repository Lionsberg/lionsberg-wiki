# One
In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[One]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point to the same [[Ultimate Reality]] that English word tools such as [[God]], [[Source]], [[Absolute]], [[Creator]], etc. point to. 

It refers to the [[One]] thing from, through, and to which [[All]] other things arise and return. 

Rather than adopt any existing concretization of the [[Absolute]], the [[Lionsberg System]] intentionally leaves this in the [[Abstract]] so that it stays transcendent of all human ideology, and so that people from many different perspectives and systems of belief can relate to it and wrestle with it eternally. 

By putting our Selves in service of [[One]] and [[All]], we are compelled to align our [[Aim]] with the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] of which we can presently conceive. 

WARNING: Do not attempt to [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]] or the System will fail! In religious terms, reducing [[Ultimate Reality]] to a human-made set of forms or propositions is akin to [[Idolatry]]. 

In the [[Old World]] humanity devolved into ridiculous debates and warfare over whose God was the One. In the [[New World]] we can see that this is ridiculous, and that we [[All]] flow from [[One]] eternal and universal [[Source]]. 

By placing our Selves in service of [[One]] and [[All]], we place our Selves in service of the [[One Thing]] that unites us All, and we [[Help One Another]] progress towards Unity and Wholeness through Love.
