# Concretize The Absolute

See also [[Idolatry]].

[[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretizing The Absolute]] is a core [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]]. 

In religious terms, it is akin to the sin of Idolatry, in which one sets up an image and worships it as if it were [[One]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], the [[Meta]] level of conceptual abstraction must always remain [[Universal and Eternal]], and not reduced to any one thing in any place or time. 

We can participate in, relate to, and experience the [[Meta]] level, however the moment we attempt to contain it, box it in, or define it too narrowly it ceases to be the [[Absolute]] that we are trying to rightly relate to. 

[[Knowledge]] in the [[Lionsberg System]] System is organized through the lens of a [[Meta Science]] that reflects our [[Current Best Understanding]], with the humble acknowledgement that it is partial and incomplete at best. 

Grappling with the [[Absolute]] as an eternal and ineffable mystery, while still aiming at it and trying to [[Get A Little Better Every Day]] as we progress towards It, is the antidote to this [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]].
