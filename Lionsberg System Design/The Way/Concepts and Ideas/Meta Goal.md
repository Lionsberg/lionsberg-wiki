# Meta Goal

The word [[Meta]] as it is used in the [[Lionsberg System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

Therefore the **Meta Goal** is the highest universal overarching and uniting "Goal of goals", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible goals.

The idea of the **Meta Goal** is critical because it provides a framework in which to stack up and align our individual goals, with the goals of the various things we participate in, with the **Meta Goal** that is big enough to unite [[All]].  

Because the word [[Meta]] in the System points towards the [[Absolute]], it is intentionally not concretized. This is to avoid the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that occurs when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]]. 

It could be described as (something like): 

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness._  

Making this Goal a Reality would require solving the total set of problems and accomplishing the total set of goals. 

This is our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Aim]] of the [[One]]. It is the perfect [[Unity]] that lies at the end of the [[Logic of Love]].
