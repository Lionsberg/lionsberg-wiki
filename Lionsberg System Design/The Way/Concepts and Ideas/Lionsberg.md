# Lionsberg

Lionsberg is a mythical name and place where we can [[All]] come together to attempt to act out and embody the [[Meta Idea]] / [[Meta Project]] right here in our own [[Space and Time]]. 

It was created based on the hypothesis that in order for the [[Meta Idea]] to [[Realize]] itself, it needed to "descend" and be embodied in a structure, place, and time, so that it could [[Perceive]] and interact with our world.  

It was conceptualized and articulated by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a growing network / community of friends and allies. See [[Jordan's Guide to Lionsberg]] for the founder's perspective.
