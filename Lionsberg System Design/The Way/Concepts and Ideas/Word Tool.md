# Word Tool
In the [[Lionsberg System]], the term [[Word Tool]] is frequently used in order to remind the reader / listener that the words being spoken are merely tools to point towards an underlying aspect of Reality. 

Why: This convention began ddue to the polarization, division, and co-opting of words in the [[Old World]] that made it very difficult to talk about the [[Most Important Things]]. 

By creating "space" between the Word Tools being used, and the underlying Reality they were pointing towards, we aim to open up space for genuine communication to occur.
