# Fill Up What Is Lacking
This is the basic idea that if we are moving towards the [[Best Possible Future]], and we see something that is lacking, we should fill it up. 

If it exists in the New World, and it does not exist [[Where We Are]], then we Co-Create it. 

This statement works in parallel with [[Remove What Does Not Belong]].
