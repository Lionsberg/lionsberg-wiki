# Meta Idea

The **Meta Idea** of the [[Lionsberg System]] and the [[Meta Project]] is that [[All]] things flow from [[One]] thing that contains and orders [[All]] things within Itself. 

This notion points at the same [[Ultimate Reality]] that words like [[One]], [[God]], and [[Absolute]] point to. Rather than adopt any existing concretization of the [[Absolute]], the [[Lionsberg System]] intentionally leaves this in the [[Abstract]] so that it stays transcendent of human ideology. 

## Extension 

The pragmatic extension of this idea is that [[All]] things that flow from the [[One]] thing are intended to function in [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] and [[Harmony]]. 

## Application 

The [[Lionsberg System]] was incarnated as a [[The Way|Way]] to pragmatically [[Act As If]] the [[Meta Idea]] were [[True]]. It is an attempt to help people [[Operationalize]] the [[Universal and Eternal]] right here in our own [[Time]] and Place. 

The [[Meta Idea]] logically leads to the notion of a [[Universal Law]] or a [[Meta Law]] of unconditional [[Love]] that compels us to help, serve, and not harm [[One Another]]. 

This highest level of abstraction, or the most fundamental aspect of [[Reality]], expressed in the [[Lionsberg System]] as the [[One]], or the [[Meta Idea]], can be brought down a level into the differentiated aspects, expressions, or ways to think about and participate in It, through ideas such as: 

- The [[Meta Project]]  
- The [[Meta Game]]  
- The [[Meta Science]]  
- The [[Meta Community]]  
- The [[Meta Goal]]  
- The [[Meta Intention]]  
- Etc...
