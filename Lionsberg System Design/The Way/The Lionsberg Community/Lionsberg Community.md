# Lionsberg Community
One basic #epiphany is that in order to design and build a better word, we must inspire a global community of goodwill to design and build itself. 

While that [[Meta Community]] is eternal, universal, and beyond any name, down here on earth, in our time and place, we have to be able to find one another, help one another, and pragmatically work together to gather and apply energy and resources. 

This requires that the eternal / universal / highest level of abstraction / most fundamental [[Meta Level]] be brought down to earth and [[Incarnates|Incarnated]] in our time and place. 

The [[Lionsberg Community]] is our attempt to incarnate and [[Enact]] / [[Operationalize]] the idea of the [[Meta Community]].
