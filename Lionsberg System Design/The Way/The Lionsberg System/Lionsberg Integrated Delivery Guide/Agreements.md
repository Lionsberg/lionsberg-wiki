Agreements play a significant role in forging the basis of [[Right Relationship]]. 

In order for our [[Agreements]] to properly stack up and align, they must start with the [[One]] must fundamental thing, progress to Our [[Self|Selves]], and then begin to extend out to those around us.

These agreements are all elements of one overarching and uniting [[Meta Agreement]], which contains and orders within itself the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Agreements]].
