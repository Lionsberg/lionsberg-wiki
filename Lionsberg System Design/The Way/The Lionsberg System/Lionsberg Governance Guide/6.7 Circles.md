# 6.7 Circles
To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, Individuals [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Circles]] and [[Communities]].  

Small, effective groups and teams are the basis of execution in the System. These nodes of community, life, and action are called [[Circles]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] respects the Sovereignty and Autonomy of [[Circles]] composed by Voluntarily Associating Individuals. 

Circles inalienably possess all inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] defined in the System, via the Individuals that compose them. 

Each Circle should do their best to [[Co-Operate]] a [[Circle Instance]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Circle Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating at every [[Fractal]] level. 

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, [[Circles]] [[Organize and Federate]] by forming Sub-Circles and Super-Circles. As they do this, they become [[Organizations]] and [[Communities]]. 

In general, circles: 

- Have a defined Aim / Goal  
- Have responsibility and authority in a [[Domain]]  
- Have defined [[Roles]]  
- Process and Solve [[Issues]]  
- Make decisions based on [[Discernment]] and [[Consent]]  
- Have [[Links]] to other [[Circles]] that produce energy and information flow, and alignment.
