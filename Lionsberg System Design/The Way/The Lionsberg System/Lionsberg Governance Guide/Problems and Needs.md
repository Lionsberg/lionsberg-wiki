# Problems and Needs

Sovereigns find themselves thrown into a [[Time]] and [[Space]] in the Universe, and immediately find themselves faced with an inherent set of [[Problems and Needs]]. 

These Problems and Needs constitute a basic [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]]. 

The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] is is composed of [[General Issues]] that are common to [[All]]. 

If, for instance, one does not have a current issue with food, water, shelter, energy, clothing, or community, it is not because the Issue does not exist, but rather that the Need is somehow being met. 

Our [[Problems and Needs]], often made manifest to us through [[Pain]], are like a stick or goad that drives us away from the Pain and Suffering, towards a Higher and Better Place. 

From our own direct experience, a basic set of [[Universal Problems and Needs]] can be derived. 

These [[Universal Problems and Needs]] are reflected in the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]].  

## Away From Suffering and Dysfunction

Basic human nature impels us to move away from unnecessary [[Suffering]] and [[Dysfunction]], and towards something [[Better]]. 

The basis Spirit of [[Love]] impels us to help [[All]] others do the same.
