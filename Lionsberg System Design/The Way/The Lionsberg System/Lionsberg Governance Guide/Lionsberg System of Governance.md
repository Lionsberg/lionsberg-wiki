# Lionsberg System of Governance

The [[Lionsberg System]] is a [[System of Systems]]. One [[System]] is the Lionsberg System of Governance. 

The Lionsberg System of Governance is designed to ensure that decision-making and resource allocation within the community are transparent, accountable, and representative of the diverse needs and interests of all members.  

As they are lived out in the [[Old World]], the existing examples of governance, from military dictatorship, to authoritarianism / totalitarianism, to monarchy, to colonialism, to aristocracy, to oligarchy, to socialism, to communism, to democracy, to anarchy all have revealed critical cracks in their nature and implementations that make them, despite their benefits, inadequate for this millennium of human history.

The Lionsberg System aims to respect and retain the very best features and ideas of each of the existing and paradigms, while adding in significant new features and capabilities. 

In keeping with our current best understanding of governance, the Lionsberg System operates with four branches of government: legislative, judicial, executive, and regulatory. 

At the highest level of wisdom and discernment, the Lionsberg System is guided by the [[Lionsberg Council of Elders]], comprising respected leaders and thinkers from within the community who are charged with guiding the [[Vision]] and direction of the community. The Council of Elders is elected by the community, and serves as a steward of the community's wisdom, principles, and values, as well as a facilitator of dialogue, collaboration, and dispute resolution among all members. The Council of Elders is akin to a Supreme Court in a governance system such as the united states, with the additional role of serving as wisdom council to the key legislative and executive leaders. 

On the legislative front, the policy and procedure of Lionsberg is determined by the [[Lionsberg General Assembly]]. 

Executive functions are carried out by the [[Lionsberg Core Enterprise]] under the guidance of the [[Lionsberg Executive Council]] 

Beyond the three general branches of governance listen above lie an array of functional Groups in the [[Regulatory Branch]] that hold the entire System within the [[Range of Tolerance]] for each [[Function]]. 

These [[Functional Groups]] are responsible for regulating, empowering, and balancing the various functions of the Whole within their specified [[Range of Tolerance]]. 

Beyond the [[Lionsberg Council of Elders]], the [[Lionsberg General Assembly]], the [[Lionsberg Core Enterprise]], and the [[Lionsberg Regulatory Groups]], which form the relatively small federal government, the Lionsberg System is composed of a vast array of self-governing, sovereign, and autonomous individuals, organizations and communities, each with their own self-governance structure that conforms to the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]]. 

These communities may be organized around geographic regions, areas of practice or expertise, or shared interests, and may have their own elected leaders and decision-making bodies.

Decision-making within the Lionsberg System is based on a consensus-based model, in which all members of a community have a say in the decisions that affect them. This model is designed to ensure that all voices are heard and that all members feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the direction of the community.

In addition to more traditional forms of governance, the Lionsberg System also incorporates mechanisms for empowering crowd-sourced decision-making and resource allocation, such as online voting and crowdfunding platforms. These tools allow for greater participation and transparency in the decision-making process, and help to ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the collective will of the community.

Recall that the entire [[Lionsberg System]] is constructed as an interoperable [[Kit of Parts]] contained in a [[Prototype]], that can be localized and [[Instantiation|Instantiated]] in any time or place. 

The entire [[System]], like any System, is designed to [[Interoperate]] as a unified Whole  to produce [[Throughput]] of its [[Meta Goal|Goal]], which is the wellbeing and flourishing of all. 

The **Lionsberg System of Governance** is inherently designed to interoperate with the [[Lionsberg Economic System]], the [[Lionsberg Community and Culture System]], the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]], and the [[Lionsberg Integrated Development System]], and other core elements of the System and Structure. 

More information on the how the entire [[System of Systems]] interoperates to empower the community to progress towards [[The Goal]] can be found in [[The Lionsberg Meta Guide]].
