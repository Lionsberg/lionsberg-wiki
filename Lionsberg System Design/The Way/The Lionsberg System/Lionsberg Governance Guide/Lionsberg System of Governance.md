# Lionsberg System of Governance

The [[Lionsberg System]] is a [[System of Systems]]. One [[System]] is the Lionsberg System of Governance. 

The Lionsberg System of Governance is designed to ensure that decision-making and resource allocation within the community are transparent, accountable, and representative of the diverse needs and interests of all members.  

[[False Dichotomies]]  



As they are lived out in the [[Old World]], the existing examples of governance, from military dictatorship, to authoritarianism / totalitarianism, to monarchy, to colonialism, to aristocracy, to oligarchy, to socialism, to communism, to democracy, all have revealed critical cracks in their nature and implementations that make them, despite their benefits, inadequate for this millennium of human history.

The Lionsberg System aims to respect and retain the very best features of each of the existing and paradigms, while adding in significant new features and capabilities. 

In keeping with our current best understanding of governance, the Lionsberg System operates with three branches of government: legislative, judicial, and executive. 

At the highest level of wisdom and discernment, the Lionsberg System is guided by the [[Lionsberg Council of Elders]], comprising respected leaders and thinkers from within the community who are charged with guiding the [[Vision]] and direction of the community. The Council of Elders is elected by the community, and serves as a steward of the community's values and principles, as well as a facilitator of dialogue, collaboration, and dispute resolution among all members. The Council of Elders is akin to the Supreme Court in a governance system such as the united states, with the additional role of serving as wisdom council to the key legislative and executive leaders. 

On the legislative front, the policy and procedure of Lionsberg is determined by the [[Lionsberg General Assembly]]. 



Below the Council of Elders, the Lionsberg System is divided into a number of smaller communities, each with its own governance structure. These communities may be organized around geographic regions, areas of expertise, or shared interests, and may have their own elected leaders and decision-making bodies.

Decision-making within the Lionsberg System is based on a consensus-based model, in which all members of a community have a say in the decisions that affect them. This model is designed to ensure that all voices are heard and that all members feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the direction of the community.

In addition to traditional forms of governance, the Lionsberg System also incorporates mechanisms for crowd-sourced decision-making and resource allocation, such as online voting and crowdfunding platforms. These tools allow for greater participation and transparency in the decision-making process, and help to ensure that resources are allocated in a way that reflects the collective will of the community.
