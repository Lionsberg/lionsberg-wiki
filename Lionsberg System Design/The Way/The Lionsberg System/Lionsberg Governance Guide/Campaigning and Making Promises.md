# Campaigning and Making Promises
## The Problem
A common issue with governance is when it devolves into a System in which individuals must campaign. 

This often leads to a system in which outgoing, attractive, charismatic leaders win office by making promises and compromises, and pitting constituencies against one another. 

- Only those comfortable putting themselves forward confidently will run for office. 
- Often results in making a series of promises to special interest groups 
- Often results in divisiveness and splitting constituencies into opposing camps. 

## Hypothesis

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of how to address this issue is through a bottom up system of fractal self-governance, in which leaders are recognized and nominated at each level of abstraction.
