# Meta Aspiration

Any time we use our left hemisphere to separate out elements of a System, we must eventually progress beyond the discrete elements to get back in touch with the System view of the Whole. 

The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is unified at the top by [[One]] highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

We could articulate it as something like _the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness._  

Beyond that, we could say it is simply [[Love]]. 

Beyond that, we could say it is simply [[One]]. 

It is at this One [[Aim]] that the entire [[Lionsberg System]] is pointed. 

It is our System of Governance that helps us Navigate towards it.
