# Transformation

[[Metamorphosis]] of the character, nature, or embodiment of something.

Perhaps the most important mechanism in the [[LIONSBERG System]] is the process through which it elevates and transforms as it progressively conforms itself to the [[Ideal]]. 

Rather than being primarily identified with its current [[State of Being]] of Embodiment, Lionsberg is primarily identified with _Spirt guiding its subsequent transformations across time and place_ as it advances towards [[The Goal]].   

Because [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]] is directly related to transformation, a Process of [[Continuous Elevation]] has been articulated and should be applied at every fractal level of the System, including the System as a Whole. 

The importance of this cannot be overstated.
