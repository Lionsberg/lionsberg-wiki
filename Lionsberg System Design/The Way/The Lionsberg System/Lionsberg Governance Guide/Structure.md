# Structure
Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community should adopt a [[Wise Right]] [[Structure]] that is appropriate for their current [[State of Being]], and development towards their [[Potential]].  

It is very difficult to model the principles and behaviors of the New World in the antiquated structures of the Old World, so it is our duty to design and build the best New structures we can. 

## Built to Elevate and Transform 

Structures, like the System as a whole, should be designed and built to [[Transform]] over [[Time]] as the Life within advances towards its [[Aim]] and [[Potential]].  

Over time, all structures should strive to conform themselves towards the Most Faithful Prototype / Ideal. 

## Federated Stewardship Structure 

A legally federated [[Stewardship Structure]] is the [[Ideal]], and should be activated in all areas where possible as a pragmatic aid to governance. 

For an example of a federated Stewardship Structure, see [[Provisional Structure]].
