# 6.9 Communities
To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, Individuals, Circles, and Organizations [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Communities]].    

The [[Lionsberg System]] respects the Sovereignty and Autonomy of [[Communities]] composed of Voluntarily Associating Individuals, Circles, Organizations, and other Communities. 

[[Communities]] inalienably possess all inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] defined in the System, via the Individuals that ultimately compose them. 

Each Community should do their best to [[Co-Operate]] a [[Community Instance]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Community Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating at every [[Fractal]] level. 

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, [[Communities]] [[Organize and Federate]] by forming Sub-Communities and Super-Communities. 

As they do this, they advance towards the ultimate unity of the [[Meta Community]] of [[One]] and [[All]] through Love.
