# Decision Making

Each [[Participant]] in the System has the Right and Responsibility to engage in the [[Governance]] and [[Decision Making]] of the Circles they Participate in, and to ensure that the Individual and Local Governance aligns with and supports the Governance of the Whole. 

Decision making is rooted in the belief that each Individual has a spark of the Divine and an inner guide, and is therefore both equipped and qualified to Govern them Selves, and Participate in the Self Governance of their Circles and the Whole. 

Decisions are made on the basis of Discernment and Consent around Proposals.
