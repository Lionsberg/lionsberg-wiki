# 6.4 Transparency and Accountability 
All elements of the System commit to relationships of [[Transparency]] and [[Accountability]] with the Systems they are a part of of, the Systems that are a part of them, and the other Systems they relate to. 

Transparency is not absolute and should be balanced within the context of all other [[Rights And Responsibilities]] in a Spirit of Truth and Love. 

See [[x.x Minimum Standards of Interoperability]].
