The President shall submit proposed members of the [[Core Group]] to the [[General Council]] for review and approval.

The Self-Governance at each fractal level aggregates up to a total strategy and roadmap to advance the Whole towards [[The Goal]]. 

As [[Proposal|Proposals]] are adopted, they are passed to the [[Executive Branch]] for execution as projects nested within the [[Integrated Delivery System]]. 

The [[Core Enterprise]] will intentionally be kept as small as possible, with functions delegated out to the greatest extent feasible to other organizations within the System.  

This is critical to preventing the System from devolving towards a large and relatively [[Unaccountable And Opaque]] central bureaucracy, which should be avoided at all costs.
