The General Assembly shall appoint an Executive Council of 7 to 12 members. 

The General Assembly shall appoint one of these leaders as Chief Executive of the [[Core Enterprise]]. 

The Lionsberg Executive Council acts in the capacity of a [[Wisdom Council]] for the [[Core Enterprise]]. 

The Chief Executive of the Core Enterprise is responsible for forging a [[Core Group]] capable of successfully leading execution of the Lionsberg [[System Wide Master Plan]]. 

The Chief Executive shall submit proposed members of the [[Core Group]] to the [[General Council]] for review and approval. 

The [[Core Group]] and [[Core Enterprise]], under the supervision of the Executive Council, are responsible for all executive and coordinative functions at the federal level required to support and empower the federation to accomplish the milestones identified in the [[System Wide Master Plan]].

The Self-Governance at each fractal level aggregates up to a total strategy and roadmap to advance the Whole towards [[The Goal]]. 

As [[Proposal|Proposals]] are adopted, they are passed to the [[Integrated Delivery System]] for execution, and overseen by the [[Core Group]] or its delegees. 

The [[Core Enterprise]] will intentionally be kept as small as possible, with functions delegated out to the greatest extent feasible to other organizations within the System.  

This is critical to preventing the System from devolving towards a large central bureaucracy, which should be avoided at all costs.
