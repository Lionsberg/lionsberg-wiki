# Roles

Groups use the [[Decision Making Process]], rooted in [[Proposals]], [[Discernment]] and [[Consent]], to nominate Individuals into [[Roles]]. 

An Individual should only serve in a Role if they have the respect and trust of their peers in that particular [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]], and are willing and able to reliably execute the [[Function]]. 

Roles should be based on [[Functional Accountability]] rather than Hierarchy. 

Be especially aware of creating Roles or [[Titles]] that create bottlenecks or lids. This usually occurs by creating a role that there can only be one of, such as King or Chief. This is one of the [[Patterns of Failure]]. 

We are [[One Body]], and there is only [[ONE]] King. 

Remember, we assemble [[The Body]] by Function and [[Responsibility]]. 

[[Roles]] should be clearly represented on a [[Functional Accountability Chart]].
