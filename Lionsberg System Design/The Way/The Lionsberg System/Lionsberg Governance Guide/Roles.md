# Roles

Groups use [[Decision Making Process]], rooted in [[Discernment]] and [[Consent]], to nominate Individuals into [[Roles]]. 

An Individual should only serve in a Role if they have the respect and trust of their peers in that particular [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]].  

Roles should be based on Function, rather than the traditional Hierarchy of the Old World. 

Be especially aware of creating roles or titles that create bottlenecks or lids. This usually occurs by creating a role that there can only be one of, such as King or Chief. This is one of the [[Patterns of Failure]].
