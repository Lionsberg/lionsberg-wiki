# Representation

In any government or committee, if all perspectives are not represented those who are unrepresented are likely reject the [[Proposed Solutions]] and [[Decision Making|Decisions]]. 

This sentiment is reflected in the popular statement "Nothing about us without us". 

If one party does not have their needs met, or fears they will not be met in the future, escalating conflict is unavoidable. 

Representation is key to being seen, heard, and valued. This crates an environment of love, safety, and trust. If we can make All feel genuinely loved, safe, and valued, then we can have trust. If we can have trust, we can unite. If we can unite, we can transform the world.
