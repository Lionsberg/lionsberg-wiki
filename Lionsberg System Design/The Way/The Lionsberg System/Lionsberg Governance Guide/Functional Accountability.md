# Functional Accountability

The [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] is rooted in Functional Accountability across levels of abstraction. 

It views the entire Human System and Living System as one Whole / Body, with each element of the System responsible and accountable to certain functions within the System. 

Each Group, Organization, and Community should develop a [[Functional Accountability Chart]]. 

While Groups necessarily delegate Functional Accountability to Individuals, they should retain full Accountability and Responsibility for All Functions at the Group Level. 

Organizations should delegate functional accountability to [[Groups]], not Individuals. 

This prevents the entire weight of the Whole from every resting on a single point of potential failure, and fosters a [[Zero Blame Environment]].
