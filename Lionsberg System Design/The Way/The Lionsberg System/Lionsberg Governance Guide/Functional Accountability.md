# Functional Accountability

The [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] is rooted in Functional Accountability across levels of abstraction, rather than hierarchy. 

It views the entire Human System and Living System as one Whole / Body, with each element of the System responsible and accountable to certain functions within the System. 

Each Circle, Organization, and Community should develop a Functional Accountability Chart. 

While Groups necessarily delegate Functional Accountability to Individuals, they should retain full Accountability and Responsibility for All Functions at the Group Level. 

Organizations should delegate functional accountability to [[Groups]], not Individuals. 

This prevents the entire weight of the Whole from every resting on a single point of potential failure, and fosters a [[Zero Blame Environment]].
