# Functional Accountability

The [[Lionsberg System]] co-operates via clearly defined Functional Accountability across [[Levels of Abstraction]] and [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]]. 

It views the entire Human System and Living System as [[One Body]], with each element of the System responsible and accountable for certain [[Functions]] within the System. 

Each Group, Organization, and Community should develop and continuously update and improve a [[Functional Accountability Chart]]. 

While Groups necessarily delegate Functional Accountability to Individuals, they should retain full Accountability and Responsibility for All Functions at the Group Level, and cultivate a [[Zero Blame Environment]]. 

[[Second Degree Groups]] and Higher Order Groups of Groups should delegate functional accountability to [[Groups]], not Individuals. 

This prevents the entire weight of The Whole from ever resting on a single point of potential failure, and fosters a [[Zero Blame Environment]].
