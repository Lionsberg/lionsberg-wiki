# Goals and Aspirations

From the depths of our suffering, we can always lift our eyes up to the mountain tops, and aspire towards something [[Better]]. 

These Goals and Aspirations constitute a basic [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]].

A close approximation can be found in articulations like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that were ratified by 193 member nations, and represent broad human consensus about what we aspire to. 

[[All]] [[Life]] is longing for a [[Better World]] in which we are liberated from unnecessary suffering, and have the opportunity to develop into our potential and flourish. 

See [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]].  

The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] is unified by [[ONE]] overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]].  

The Purpose of the [[System]] is to bring the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] into [[Reality]].
