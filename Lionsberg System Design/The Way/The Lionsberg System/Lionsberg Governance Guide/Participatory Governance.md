# Participatory Governance

Each [[Participant]] in the System has the Right and Responsibility to engage in the [[Governance]] and [[Decision Making]] of the Circles they Participate in, and to ensure that the Individual and Local Governance aligns with and supports the Governance of the Whole. 

## Governance 
Governance in the System relates towards how we navigate or steer our Selves towards our Aim. 

Our System of Governance is like a milestone-based roadmap that enables us to rapidly operate and iterate day to day as we advance towards our Goal. 

This [[Self Governance]] occurs at every fractal level of the System, as well as the Whole. 

## Decision Making
Decision making is rooted in the belief that each Individual has a spark of the Divine and an inner guide, and is therefore both equipped and qualified to Govern them Selves, and Participate in the Self Governance of their Circles and the Whole. 

Decisions are made on the basis of Discernment and Consent around Proposals. 

### Proposals

This [[Proposal]]-based-system serves as the basis of [[Continuous Improvement]]  of the System. 

### Consent 

[[Consent]] is defined as the absence of [[Objection]] to a [[Proposal]], which ensures that the Proposal, even if not perfect, Â falls within each member's [[Range of Tolerance]] as the Circle advances towards its Aim.

### Objections

Individuals have the moral obligation to Object if they reasonably believe that the Circle will be unable to achieve its Aim if the Proposal is Enacted.

Any member of a Circle has the right and responsibility to stop the Progress and require improvement of the Proposal before it can advance if the Proposal will cause [[Harm]]. 

Objections should be framed relative to Progress towards the Aim. The Objection should address how the [[Proposal]] would  [[Harm]] the ability of the Circle to advance towards its [[Aim]]. 

Individuals should balance their Preference and [[Range of Tolerance]], and use [[Wisdom]] to [[Discern]] when to Object, and when to accept something that varies from Preference but is within their Range of Tolerance.

As a general rule, the greater the [[Span of Impact]] of a Decision, the more [[Time]] the group should be willing to spend to merge towards the [[Consensus]] that is always available with enough Wisdom, Time and Patience.

### Delegation

Individuals may choose to delegate their Decision Making Authority to another member of the Circle they trust.
