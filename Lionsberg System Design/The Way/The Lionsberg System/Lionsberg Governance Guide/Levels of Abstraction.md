# Levels of Abstraction

The concept of levels of abstraction is a way of describing the different layers of thinking and understanding that we use to interpret and make sense of the world around us. It is a framework that allows us to move from the highest level of abstraction, which is beyond language, concepts, and thought, to the most concrete level of action and implementation.

## Overview

At its core, the concept of levels of abstraction is about understanding the different layers of thinking that are involved in solving complex problems or exploring complex ideas. It provides a framework for thinking about the various stages of thinking that we go through as we move from pure consciousness to action.

The exact number and description of levels of abstraction can vary depending on the context and the goals of the analysis. However, a typical model might include at least three levels: 
1. Pure consciousness 
2. Conceptualization 
3. Action

At the level of pure consciousness, we are in a state of awareness that is beyond language, concepts, and thought. 

At the level of conceptualization, we are engaging with ideas and concepts to develop a deeper understanding of the world. 

And at the level of action, we are taking concrete steps to achieve our goals.

## Levels of Abstraction in Practice

The levels of abstraction can be applied in a wide range of contexts and disciplines, including philosophy, science, engineering, business, and education. In each context, the specific levels of abstraction and their meanings may vary depending on the goals and objectives of the analysis.

For example, in a business context, the levels of abstraction might include additional levels such as strategy, planning, execution, and evaluation. In a scientific context, the levels might include additional layers such as observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis. In a philosophical context, the levels might include perception, reasoning, theory, and philosophy.

Regardless of the specific context, the levels of abstraction provide a valuable framework for understanding complex problems and developing effective solutions. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable layers of abstraction, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and principles that govern the problem. This can help us to develop more effective strategies and plans, and to take more informed and effective actions.

## Proper Use of Levels of Abstraction

While systems of hierarchy are often misunderstood, misused, and abused, Systems must be understood and operated with a reasonable understanding of [[Depth]] and [[Levels Of Abstraction]].  

In complex adaptive Systems such a Body or a Tree, Decisions must be made and the System must be structured according to Depth, such that the System prioritizes the Trunk of the Tree over a Leaf, and the Heart of the Body over the hair.  

Further, the System cannot be rightly perceived, understood or operated without making such relative judgments of Value. 

While we should always attend to the entire System or Gestalt as a Whole, there is a healthy and natural process whereby we begin to make wise and practical use of categories and levels of analysis / abstraction to organize energy, resources, and effort. 

This categorization and organization is an _intermediate step_ to once again perceiving the Whole, with a far greater and richer level of understanding and functional capability. 

Where hierarchy and differentiated levels of abstraction can be misused is when they become mechanisms for domination and control, rather than service and support. 

If instead ontologies and levels of abstraction are productively used to differentiate out and organize understanding and action, such as in an outline, the Dewey Decimal System or the Work Breakdown Structure in a Project Plan, they can be extremely useful in terms of organizing and prioritizing energy and action. 

In its best and highest use, the [[Whole]] is perceived and related to first in its entirety, prior to being broken down into various levels of analysis that create the ability to relate to the Whole through the relative simplicity of headings and categories, without mistaking the Map for the Territory. 

The categories and differentiated levels of abstraction / analysis allow for the mass of details, processes, and steps to be managed and understood in an organized way, without losing the ability to relate to the System _first_ and primarily as a Whole. 

Properly viewed, the [[Left Hemisphere]] / Analytical / Differentiated view affords the opportunity to serve and support by aligning and supporting each element of the Whole correctly and usefully for All, without losing the [[Right Hemisphere]] / Intuitive / Receptive perception of the Whole as the interexistent Mystery that it is. 

The Lionsberg System attempts to afford a useful philosophical and conceptual hierarchy to promote understanding and organization, while protecting the primacy of right relationship in the Whole.  

## Conclusion

In summary, the concept of levels of abstraction is a powerful framework that allows us to navigate complex problems and ideas by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable layers of thinking. By understanding the different levels of abstraction and their relationships, we can develop more effective strategies and plans, and take more informed and effective actions.
