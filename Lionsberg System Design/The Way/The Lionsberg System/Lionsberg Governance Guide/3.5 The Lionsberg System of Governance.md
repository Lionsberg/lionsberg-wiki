# 3.5 The Lionsberg System of Governance
The [[Lionsberg System]] is a [[System of Systems]]. 

It contains a System of Governance, just like one would find in democracy, sociocracy, or other national or corporate governance methods.

Just as the Lionsberg System of Economy is equidistant from the false binary choices of capitalism and socialism, so too is the Lionsberg System of Governance equidistant from the false dichotomies around centralization and decentralization, democracy and monarchy, etc.

As they are lived out in the [[Old World]], the existing examples of governance, from military dictatorship, to authoritarianism / totalitarianism, to monarchy, to colonialism, to aristocracy, to oligarchy, to socialism, to communism, to democracy, all have revealed critical cracks in their nature and implementations that make them, despite their benefits, inadequate for this millennium of human history.

Just as it is possible to simultaneously embrace both autonomous action by participants in free markets, as well as love leading to robust social and environmental stewardship, so too is it possible to embrace both the Sovereignty and Autonomy of each individual and each element, as well as the highest duty to co-operate in a spirit of Love for the Good of All.

Rather than blindly import and accept any of the Old models as the right answer despite their clear dysfunctions, we are [[Doing Our Best]] to fulfill the moral imperative to elevate and transform [[What Is]] in to [[What Ought To Be]] so that together we can Succeed and Avoid Failure at this critical juncture in history. 

The goal in such phase transitions is to do our best to retain the best features of the [[Old]] systems, while gaining significant new capabilities and competence across a broader array of scenarios, including the immediate crises facing us today.
