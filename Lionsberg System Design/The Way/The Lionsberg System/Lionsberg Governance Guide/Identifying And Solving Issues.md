# Identifying and Solving Issues 

The [[Lionsberg System]] recommends a five part approach to identifying and solving issues. 

1. Every [[Actor]] should establish an [[Issue Tracker]]    
2. **Identify** - Name and describe [[Issues]] in detail as they are encountered to bring them into the Light  
3. **Prioritize** - Prioritize and [[Solve The Most Important Issues First]]. 
4. **Dialogue** 
	1. Step 1: Ask clarifying questions 
	2. Step 2: Dialogue and explore without offering solutions 
5. **Solve** - Use [[Wisdom]] and [[Discernment]] to arrive at a [[Proposal]] that Solves the Issue  

**Escalate If Necessary** - if the group is unable to solve the issue at the local level, use the [[Escalation Ladder]]. The [[Escalation Ladder]] should be used sparingly so that Actors at Higher [[Levels of Analysis]] can properly [[Focus]] their [[Attention]].
