# Rights and Responsibilities
  
 All Individuals flow from [[ONE]] [[Source]] and are members of [[One Family]] and [[One Community]] of [[Life]]. 

As such, every Individual inalienably possesses all the inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the family and community of [[ONE]]. 

These [[Rights And Responsibilities]] are both equal and inalienable to [[All]]. 

After the horrors and world wars at the close of the last millennium, humanity made great progress in articulating and agreeing upon the [[Universal Rights]] common to [[All]] human beings.  

At the opening of the New Millennium, these rights began to be extended legally and foundationally to [[All]].  

The [[LIONSBERG System]] begins from the foundational starting point of the total reintegration and [[Right Relationship]] of [[ONE]] and [[All]], rooted in [[Love]]. 

## Rights Extend First to the Weak and Vulnerable

Diametrically opposed to the logic of the [[Old World]], in the [[New World]] Rights extend first to the weakest and most vulnerable. 

## Responsibilities Extend First to the Strong 

Diametrically opposed to the logic of the [[Old World]], in the [[New World]] Responsibilities extend from to the Strongest and most Capable. 

It is the moral duty and ethical imperative of those capable of exercising [[Power]] to do so in service of helping, protecting, and lifting up [[All]], starting with the weakest and most vulnerable. 

The strongest, most intelligent, and most capable in the System bear the overwhelming burden of the responsibility and accountability to ensure that [[All]] flourish, without exception.
