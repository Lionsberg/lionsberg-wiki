# The Harsh Reality of Where We Are

There is no candidate we could vote into office, to piece of legislation we could pass, that could ever ensure such aspirational rights for All. 

The harsh reality is that the statements contained in the UN Declaration are extremely aspirational, and there is a vast [[Chasm]] between [[Where We Are]] and that better and higher Society that we all desire. 

## Natural Starting Points

If we imagine our Selves alone with our tribe in Nature: 

- There are no courts of justice
- There are no social safety nets
- There are no hospitals 
- There are no schools 
- There are no homes 
- There are no securities 
- There is no written law 
- There is no infrastructure 
- There are no guarantees 

It all must be forged from the ground up. 

From the primal natural starting point, we are in a struggle for survival. 

And yet we can imagine that perfectly Just and Good society, and we measurably make progress towards it. 

We _have_ measurably made progress towards it. 

## Temporal Starting Points 

In our time and place, some of us are still alone with our tribe in Nature. 

Others of us live in places that are struggling to take steps and progress towards a better society. 

And others of us live in great empires that are beginning to fray and slip back towards decadence or the corruption that inevitably has accompanied power. 

Hundreds of millions of us are homeless, billions are in various states of poverty and lack. Corruption and injustice abound. Inequality is rampant, and the rich shape law and governance to their benefit, while the poor progressively suffer. 

Returning to the metaphor of navigation there is massive variation in [[Where We Are]] around the world, but for nearly all of us, from where we are today it would be possible navigate to somewhere that is a lot better, or a lot worse. 

As new technologies in-break and accelerate us along whatever trajectories we choose, wherever we are going, we will get there at an ever increasing rate of speed. 

So let's pick the best possible trajectory.
