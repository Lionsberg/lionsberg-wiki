# The Starting Point

## Self-Evident Need To Move

As the existing structures of society reveal their inability to meet the present challenges and opportunities facing us, we are moving in response to the self-evident need for sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities to collaborate in some kind of higher order functional unity that might actually be capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems, and capturing the opportunities inherent in this unique moment in history. 

## Vision

Our Vision is a properly ordered future in which all individuals, groups, and communities are helping one another rise towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony. 

For a more articulated version of what this might look, smell, and feel like, see [[Best Possible Future]]. 

## Learnings  

After bringing together lifetimes of preparation, process and infrastructure, we began with a social experiment, followed by three six-week cycles of emergence. 

We [[Realized]] that it actually will not work to work on the Universal and Eternal [[Meta Project]] in the abstract, or within one group.   

Therefore, we are going to strive to connect and empower a [[Group Of Groups]] from the standpoint of a minimum viable: 

1. Identity  
2. Structure / Container  
3. Aim / Goal  
4. System of Governance  
5. Infrastructure and Technology Platform   
6. Set of Conditions to Facilitate [[Emergence]]  

Because it is not possible or desirable to get everyone in one group, we are facilitating the [[Emergence]] of a [[Group Of Groups]] that protects Individual and Local Sovereignty, Culture, and Identity, while affording the opportunity to Co-Operate where that is the [[Wise Right]] thing to do. 

The near term mission of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut|J]] and [[Lionsberg]] is to serve, connect, empower, and align the distributed [[Group Of Groups]] advancing towards [[The Goal]]. 

## A Progression Towards Oneness Through Love

We have [[Realize|Realized]] that the [[Group Of Groups]] must progress through a series of developmental phases before it can [[Co-Operation|Co-Operate]] as one. 

These may be something like: 

1. Awareness  
2. Intention  
3. Communication  
4. Relationship  
5. Mutual Aid  
6. Collaboration  
7. Integration 
8. Co-Operation 
9. Higher Order Functional Unity  - One Body and Mind 

Each of these stages requires a System and Infrastructure to support it, before we can advance to the next stage. 

## Next Learning Exploration  

Our next learning exploration will be invite 5 to 20 groups to come into greater awareness and communication with [[One Another]]. 

[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut|J]] and [[Lionsberg]] will do their best to create the set of conditions in which the possibility of advancing towards higher stages of [[Oneness]] can occur.
