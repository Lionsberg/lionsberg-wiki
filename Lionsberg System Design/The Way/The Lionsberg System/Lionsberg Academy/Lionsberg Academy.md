# Lionsberg Academy

# Introduction

Believe it or not, this is an elementary portal to a world class education for anyone in the world that can access an internet connection. For free. 

The Aim of the Lionsberg | Academy is to ensure that every person on earth has access to a world-class lifelong program of  learning and human development. 

As a starting point for anyone who current doesn't have a pathway to learning, we have curated together a lifelong learning journey by linking to external resources. 

We have bootstrapped up this availability primarily through five stages: 

- **Stage 1**: English Language as a key to unlock all available courses   
- **Stage 2**: Khan Academy as primary curriculum for early childhood development (Khan Academy Kids) through early college / AP courses   
- **Stage 3**: MIT OpenCourseWare to access the entire curriculum from one of the top universities in the world for free 
- **Stage 4**: The Lionsberg System and Community as the culture and context in which individuals, organizations, and communities can help one another develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony  
- **Stage 5**: From this Starting Point, we will work together to continuously learn and improve all elements of the System  

This means that, through this webpage alone, anyone in the world with an internet connection can access the highest quality learning opportunities available on earth. 

## Stage 1: English Language as a Key to Unlock Knowledge

### A Language is Merely a Key

While it is likely a far superior solution for humanity to cross-pollinate its knowledge into all local contexts, stories, and languages, this is a project that will take time. 

In the meantime, there is tremendous unnecessary pain and suffering throughout the world caused by a lack of access to basic learning pathways. 

Each individual and community of earth is sovereign and possesses the right to choose how they will help their children learn. 

Far from attempting to impose a particular language on any community, we are gathering up world class learning pathways, and offering any individual who desires it a key to unlock the gate and gain access to humanity's knowledge. 

This key can be mastered in approximately 2 to 3 months. 

With just two to three months of effort to learn English, any person on earth can embark on the entire learning journey outlined below to "level up" to college-degree level at their own pace, which places them in the top 7% of global population in terms of learning. 

### English for Adults 

The basic idea for adults is: 

- Use the pareto principle to focus on the small subset of 10% to 20% of words that make up the majority of the material (300 to 500 words)
	- ~ 25 words make up ~ 1/3 of all written materials in English 
	- ~ 100 words make up ~ 1/2 of all written materials in English 
	- ~ 300 words make up ~ 2/3 of all written material in English 
- Use an existing area of passion that you already spend time doing / reading / talking about to expand your vocabulary and sustain interest. 
- Set up a Learning Circle so you can practice daily.   
- Use a free online learning platform to support your learning journey - we currently recommend [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)

### Free Tool 1: Duolingo
