# Integrated Delivery Guide
This [[Integrated Delivery Guide]] is a [[Work In Progress]]. Please enjoy and utilize it if it is helpful as we evolve it!

If you are finding this early on, start with the [[0.0 Warning]] and [[0.2 Minimum Viable Version]] pages, and then dive into the other sections if you want more depth.  

Also feel free to skip down to [[3.1 Project Delivery Guide]] and [[3.2 Template For Project]], and [[3.3 Communications and Reporting]] if you would like to quick start a project.

And don't forget to review [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]] to help ensure your team gets off on the right track.
