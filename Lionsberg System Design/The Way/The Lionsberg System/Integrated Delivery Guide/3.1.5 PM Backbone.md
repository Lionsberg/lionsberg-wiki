# 3.1.5 PM Backbone
## Introduction
Havig something as simple as a reasonably high level [[PM Navigation Meeting]] requires an underlying PM Backbone / Framework before it can occur. 

## PM vs. Lionsberg Integrated Delivery 
The Lionsberg System draws from multiple triangulated and proved fields to create a hybrid System that retains the best elements and capabilities of: 

- Lean Integrated Program Delivery from AEC Industry  
- Product Management / Agile from Tech Industry  
- Lean Manufacturing Principles ... 

...While simultaneously offering significant new capabilities and benefits in the context of a single integrated system designed to produce Throughput of The Goal across a global community / Federation. 

To function optimally, the System encourages each Team to implement and continuously improve at least a basic PM Backbone.
