# 1.4 Time
Given the urgency of the problems facing humanity and the [[Living System]], the Receiverâ€™s time line from concept to completion for all core systems, facilities, services, and infrastructure (total transformation 80% to 90% complete) was determined to be approximately thirty years, culminating in 2050 when the program torch would be passed to a new generation adequately trained and enlightened to carry it forward towards completion and flourish.

Additional markers and milestones were established for 2075, 2100, and 3000 to ensure the Program was executed in a way that could continuously elevate and serve the living system across all generations of life to come without exception.

Additional markers and milestones were established for 2050, 2040, 2030, 2025, 2023, tied back to annual and quarterly plans, which informed monthly, weekly, and daily action.

These milestones were then tied out a logical [[Network of Commitments]] made and kept. 

**_This enabled the global community to actually see, day by day and week by week, its meaningful and measurable progress towards the Goal_**.

In light of its observations on [[Space]] and [[Time]], these timelines were held loosely, as the [[Federation]] determined to continuously improve its measurable capacity to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]]. 

It was noted as a #principle that historically humans tended to greatly overestimate what they could accomplish over relatively short periods of time, and greatly underestimate what they could accomplish over relatively large periods of time.
