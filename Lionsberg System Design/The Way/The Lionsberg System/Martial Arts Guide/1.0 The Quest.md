# 1.0 The Quest

Hello. Welcome. 

We have been waiting for you. 

You have struggled valiantly and overcome many obstacles to get here. 

Yet faced with all that lies before you, it is evident that the same patterns and behaviors that got you to this point cannot and will not carry you forward to your [[Destiny]]. 

There comes a time in each individual's [[Quest]] towards the [[Goal]] when they reach a [[Chasm]] they cannot cross, or a terrifying [[Existential Threat]] they do not know how to vanquish.

It is at this point when they must lift their eyes and their hearts to the Heavens, and [[Ask For Help]] from [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Inevitably, in exactly the right timing ([[Kairos]]), that Help appears. 

It often appears in the form of a [[Guide]], who can show them the [[Way]] to overcome the [[obstacles|Obstacle]] or [[Threat]] they are facing so that they succeed, and avoid failure, on their [[Quest]] towards their Worthy Goal.
