# 2.1 Inexhaustible Individuals
Just as the [[Way]] cannot be boxed in, ruled over, or reduced to a category, so too is every unique individual a sovereign manifestation of the [[One]] that creates and sustains [[All]] things.

You likewise cannot be categorized, boxed in, or contained.

The [[Way]] begins with returning to the state of childlike awe and wonder, in which we curiously explore and test ourselves against an infinite [[Reality]] to see what is possible.

Every Practitioner of the [[Way]] transcends all categories, and must be respected and regarded as a unique, sovereign, and irreducible manifestation of the [[One]]. 

You are an inexhaustible well of complexity and potential that [[One]] and [[All]] are longing to experience. 

So lay down the false identities you have adopted that separate you from direct right relationship and freedom of expression before [[One]] and [[All]]. Those were products of the Old World that limit and bind you. 

Rediscover the inexhaustible and true Spirit and Essence within you.
