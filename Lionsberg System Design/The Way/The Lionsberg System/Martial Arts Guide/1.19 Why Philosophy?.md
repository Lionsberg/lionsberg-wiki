# 1.19 Why Philosophy? 
Why so much philosophy? Who so much talk about the [[Old]], the [[New]], the [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]], and the Spirit in which one must progress out beyond the [[Boundary]] and across the [[Chasm]] that separates [[Where We Are]] from [[Where We Are Going]]? 

It is because we are going to equip you with great [[Power]], and the philosophy that directs that [[Power]] towards a very specific [[Aim]] will mean the difference between Life and Death for you and for many. 

Philosophy, the Love of the Mind of God, must lead, and everything else must follow and harmonize with that [[One]] Spirit. 

If those we are equipping and empowering are divided against themselves, they mutual destruction is assured, and they will drag [[All]] down towards the pit with them.
