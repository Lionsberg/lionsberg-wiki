# 1.17 The Chosen Ones
To whom does the flourishing and abundant [[New World]] we are Co-Creating belong? 

Who are the chosen people or species? 

Whom shall we include? 

Whom shall we exclude? 

Whom shall we privilege?  

Who is “we”? 

Who is invited to the great banquet table? 

There is only [[One]] that [[All]] things flow from. 

The [[One]] Divine Father and Mother love [[All]] Their children, without exception. 

And Their flourishing and abundant [[New World]] belongs to [[All]] generation of life without exception. 

No one can escape the universal rays of [[Love]] that eternally flow from the [[Source and Sustainer]] of Life. Like the rays of the sun, they penetrate, permeate, and illuminate All things. 

The [[Spirit]] of [[Love]] is universal and without exception. 

Therefore the opportunity to discover one’s potential and flourish in service of [[One]] and [[All]] should also be universal and without exception. 

You, whoever you are, are Loved and Enough. You are invited. You are welcomed. 

You have been sought out and chosen, because we [[All]] are loved, and we [[All]] are chosen, because we are [[All]] the family of the [[One]].
