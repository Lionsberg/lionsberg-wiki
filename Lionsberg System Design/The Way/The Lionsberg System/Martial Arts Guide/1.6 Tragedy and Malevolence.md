# 1.6 Tragedy and Malevolence
Make no mistake. As you rise, tragedy and malevolence will be waiting in your path. 

They are inherent in the [[Old]] world. 

In a world full of inherent tragedy and suffering, that has been further corrupted by malevolence, there is no safety. There is no permanent security. 

As you venture out of it, beyond the [[Boundary]] and across the [[Chasm]] that separates the [[Old]] from the [[New]], the only security you will ever have is who you have become, and who we have become, in partnership with [[One]] and [[One Another]]. 

There is no option available to build bigger walls and forge a garden of safety in the midst of the crumbling and failing [[Old]]. 

Our only safety lies in elevating and transforming one another into the kinds of beings who can contend with and adapt to whatever arises from the depths of the dark waters of [[Chaos]] to confront us. 

And we can rest assured that the [[Existential Threat]] lurking in those waters will certaintly arise when it discovers that we have united ourselves with the eternal Force For Good that is helping all things escape the bondage of the [[Old]] and advance towards the [[Goal]]. 

The only solution to a world of suffering, tragedy, and malevolence, is to sharpen and transform ourselves so that we become the kinds of competent, strong beings properly identified with the [[Spirit]] that rises up and hovers over the waters of [[Chaos]], so that it can speak the [[Truthful]] words that vanquish it and bring forth the [[New]] and the [[Good]].
