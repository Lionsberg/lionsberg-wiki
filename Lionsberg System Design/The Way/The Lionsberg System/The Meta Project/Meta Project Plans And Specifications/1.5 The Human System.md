# 1.5 The Human System
The [[Human System]] refers to the total set of all human systems and activity. 

The Human System is a single System within the broader [[Living System]] whether we acknowledge it or not. 

It is a complex adaptive system that co-operates as a totality and impacts both the human beings that it contains, and the Living System that contains it, for better or worse. 

In the [[Old World]], the Human System was dysfunctional and harmful to both human beings and the Living System. 

In the New World, the Human System we are co-creating will be functional and hepful to both human beings and the Living System. 

The Goal of the Human System in the New World is to create flourishing and abundant life for All.
