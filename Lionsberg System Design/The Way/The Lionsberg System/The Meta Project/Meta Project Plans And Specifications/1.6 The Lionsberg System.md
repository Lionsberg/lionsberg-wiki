# 1.6 The Lionsberg System
The Lionsberg System should be co-created and continuously improved according to our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Meta System]]. 

In other words, it is intended to be an Incarnation or living Embodiment of the abstract / conceptual [[Meta System]]. 

It should harmonize the total [[Human System]] with the total [[Living System]] and its [[Source]]. 

The sole purpose of the System is to measurably produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]]. 

As with all elements of [[Lionsberg]] and the [[Meta Project]], humanity should be careful to co-create it without destroying themselves by [[Concretizing The Absolute]]. 

This can be done by acting within the system "as if" it were the Meta System, and trying to conform it to the conceptual / Absolute [[Ideal]], while recognizing that the Absolute will eternally remain "out there" in the realm of the [[One]], as something we are striving towards.
