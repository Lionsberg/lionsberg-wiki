# 1.1 Designer's Intent 
The best designs are often guided by a single word that serves as the defining principle of all elements of the creation. 

The [[One]] overarching and uniting design principle of the [[New World]] is _Love_. 

If we [[Love]] something, we desire for it to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony with [[All]]. 

If we share in [[One]] [[Love]] for [[All]] things, we desire for [[All]] things to develop into the fullness of thier potential and flourish in harmony with [[One Another]]. 

The Community, System, and Infrastructure of the New World is therefore the means by which all Creation can [[Help One Another]] rise towards their potential and flourish. 

For [[Worksite: Earth]], it is not our Intention that reigns supreme, but the Intention of the [[One]], which is [[Love]]. 

All workers on [[Worksite: Earth]] are responsible for [[Doing Our Best|Doing Their Best]] to understand and honor the [[Designer's Intent]] in all they do. 

Any work not conforming itself to the [[Designer's Intent]] will be incompatible with the core functionality of the New World, and will therefore be rejected. 

If you are not sure what the [[Designer's Intent]] is, please [[Requests For Guidance|Ask For Guidance]].
