# 6.2 Values 
Each element in the System must ascribe to the [[Meta Value]], which can be articulated as something like Love and its Source. 

They must also align in spirit and understanding with the articulated [[Core Values]] flowing the [[Meta Value]], which include [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], and [[Wisdom]]. 

A more articulated discussion of [[Values]] is contained in [[Core Values]]. 

Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community in the System is encouraged to adopt the Lionsberg Core Values, or to articulate their own unique statement of Values in alignment with the [[Meta Value]].
