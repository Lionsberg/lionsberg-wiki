# 6.13 Integrated Delivery 
Whenever [[Work]] needs to be done, rational humans build [[System|Systems]] or machines to accomplish it. 

This use of System and Machines becomes ever more logical and necessary as the amount of [[Work]] and [[Power]] that must be applied grows. (Power here defined in terms of physics as the Rate of doing Work). 

The leading practice for transforming large programs of action into [[Goal Delivery System|Goal Delivery Systems]] is [[Integrated Delivery]]. 

The [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] has been designed and built to allow for easy [[Interoperability]] among System Elements with a minimum level of effort and skill, while simultaneously supporting the highest levels of professionalism, precision, and execution where necessary. 

The [[Organizational Development System]] and [[Organizational Development Guide]] contain within them the basic tools and resources necessary to integrate with the System. 

This is included in the [[Governance Guide]] because when a large fleet needs to [[Navigate]] together towards [[The Goal]], each Vessel must be aware of an integrated with the fleet as a Whole in order for the [[Quest]] to succeed.
