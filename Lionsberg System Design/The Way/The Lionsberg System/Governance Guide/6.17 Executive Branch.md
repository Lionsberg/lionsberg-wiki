# 6.17 Executive Branch
The Self-Governance at each fractal level aggregates up to a total strategy and roadmap to advance the Whole towards [[The Goal]]. 

As [[Proposal|Proposals]] are adopted, they are passed to the [[Integrated Delivery System]] for execution. 

At the heart of execution and operations in the federation is a [[Core Enterprise]], whose function is to act as a servant leader to all other organizations in the Federation.

The [[Core Enterprise]], like all organizations in the System, will be led by a [[Core Team]], including a designated Servant Leader responsible and accountable for the overall mission, values, and goals of the organization.

The [[Core Enterprise]] will intentionally be kept as small as possible, with functions delegated out to the greatest extent feasible to other organizations within the System.  

This is critical to preventing the System from devolving towards a large central bureaucracy, which should be avoided at all costs.
