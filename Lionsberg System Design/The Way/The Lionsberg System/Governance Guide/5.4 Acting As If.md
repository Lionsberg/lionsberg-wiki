If it were our responsibility to Govern our Selves, how might we do so for the Good of All, in a Way that _might actually work_ to solve the [[Grand Challenges]], accomplish the [[Global Goals]], and Forge the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]?  

Recognizing that [[We Do Not Know]] and we are on a [[Quest]] to search it out, the following sections lay out the components of the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]], the Minimum [[Standards Of Interoperability]], and a [[Starting Point]]. 

Remember, the entire System is built not to cling to any words, forms, or propositions contained herein, but to continuously elevate and transform along with us as we advance together towards [[The Goal]].
