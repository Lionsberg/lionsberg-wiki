# 6.10 Structure
Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community should adopt a [[Wise Right]] [[Structure]] that is appropriate for their current [[State of Being]], and development towards their [[Potential]].  

Structures, like the System as a whole, should be built to [[Transform]] over [[Time]] as the Life within advances towards its [[Aim]] and [[Potential]].  

Any form of Structure can be made compatible with the [[Lionsberg System]] through the use of Voluntary [[Agreements]]. 

For example, even a group of physicians, attorneys, or other licensed professionals who are prohibited from co-operating in a [[Stewardship Structure]] can [[Act As If]] they were operating on the basis of Stewardship by Integrating themselves with the System through [[Agreements]].  

There is nothing that prevents any individual, circle, tribe, state, nation or association from voluntarily choosing to play the Meta Game.  

Over time, _many_ different structures of _many_ different types will need to [[Organize and Federate]] in order for us to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

To facilitate this, and lower the legal and compliance costs for [[All]], [[Lionsberg]] establishes Prototypical Structures as shared [[Infrastructure]] that can be leveraged by those advancing together towards [[The Goal]]. 

See [[Provisional Structure]].
