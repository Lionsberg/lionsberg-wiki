# 3.4 Transformation
Perhaps the most important mechanism in the [[Lionsberg System]] is the process through which it transforms as it progressively conforms itself to the [[Ideal]]. 

Rather than being primarily identified with its current [[State of Being]] of Embodiment, Lionsberg is primarily identified with _Spirt guiding its subsequent transformations across time and place_ as it advances 

Because [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]] is directly related to transformation, a Process of [[Continuous Elevation]] has been articulated and should be applied at every fractal level of the System, including the System as a Whole. 

The importance of this cannot be overstated.
