# 4.4 Rights and Responsibilities
Because All Individuals flow from [[One]] [[Source]], All Individuals are members of [[One Family]]. 

As such, every Individual inalienably possesses all the inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the family of [[One]]. 

These [[Rights And Responsibilities]] are both equal and inalienable to [[All]]. 

After the horrors and world wars at the close of the last millennium, humanity made great progress in articulating and agreeing upon the [[Universal Rights]] common to [[All]] human beings.  

At the opening of the New Millennium, these rights began to be extended legally and foundationally to [[All]].  

The [[Lionsberg System]] begins from the foundational starting point of the total reintegration and [[Right Relationship]] of [[One]] and [[All]], rooted in [[Love]]. 

## Rights Extend First to the Weak and Vulnerable
Diametrically opposed to the logic of the [[Old World]], in the [[New World]] Rights extend first to the weakest and most vulnerable. 

## Responsibilities Extend First to the Strong 
It is the moral duty and ethical imperative of those capable of exercising power to do so in service of helping, protecting, and lifting up [[All]], starting with the weakest and most vulnerable. 

The strongest, most intelligent, and most capable in the System bear the overwhelming burden of the responsibility and accountability to ensure that [[All]] flourish, without exception. 

## Universal Rights 
Recognizing the inherent dignity, worth, and Value of [[All]] as members of [[One Family]] of Life, a basic list of [[Universal Rights]] can be articulated, which flow from the [[Universal Law]] and [[Universal Values]] derived from the [[Logos]] of the Universe. 

These Rights are distinct from the [[Universal Aspirations]], which are not guaranteed, but rather are the [[Ideal]] we are striving towards.
