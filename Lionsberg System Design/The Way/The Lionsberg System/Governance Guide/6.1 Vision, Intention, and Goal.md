# 6.1 Vision, Intention, and Goal
Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community must be headed in the same overarching and uniting direction, towards the same overarching and uniting Goal. 

If we are not headed in the same direction, we will not be able to [[Help One Another]] along the path to get there. 

Therefore, all elements of the System must align to the [[Meta Intention]], which is Love, and the [[Meta Goal]], which can be expressed as something like _the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life and consciousness. 

A more articulated Vision of what that might look like is outlined in [[Best Possible Future]]. 

Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community in the System is encouraged to articulate their own unique vision in alignment in the Meta Goal.
