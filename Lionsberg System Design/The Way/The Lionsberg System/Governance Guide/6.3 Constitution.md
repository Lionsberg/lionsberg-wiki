# 6.3 Constitution
## Universality

Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community must honor and uphold the highest overarching and uniting Constitution. See [[Provisional Declaration]] and [[Provisional Constitution]]. 

The Lionsberg Constitution should be incorporated by reference into each individual, circle, organization, and community constitution. 

## Durability 
The Constitution may not be changed except by 85% supermajority vote of each of the following groups: 

1. All members 
2. The Stewardship Circles of each of the member organizations and communities 

## Localization

Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community in the System is encouraged to localize, adapt, and adopt their own unique Constitution in alignment with the Lionsberg Constitution. 

## Sequence 

Formal constitutions are often preceded by Provisional Declarations that hold space and unite the Circles until such a time as a Constitution can be developed. 

A typical sequence might be: 
1. Assenting to the Lionsberg Constitution  
2. Issuing a Local Declaration  
3. Developing a Local Constitution
