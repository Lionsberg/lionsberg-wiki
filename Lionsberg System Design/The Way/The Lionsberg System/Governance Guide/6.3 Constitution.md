# 6.3 Constitution
Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community must honor and uphold the overarching and uniting Constitution. See [[Provisional Declaration]] and [[Provisional Constitution]]. 

Each Individual, Circle, Organization, and Community in the System is encouraged to localize, adapt, and adopt their own unique Constitution in alignment with the Lionsberg Constitution. 

Formal constitutions are often preceded by Provisional Declarations that hold space and unite the Circles until such a time as a Constitution can be developed.
