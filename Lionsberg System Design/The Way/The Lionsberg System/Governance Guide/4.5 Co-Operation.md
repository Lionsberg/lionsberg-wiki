# 4.5 Co-Operation
These inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] impel and empower Sovereign Agents to voluntarily [[Co-Operate]]. 

[[Co-Operate|Co-Operation]], if it is going to occur over indefinitely long periods of times, requires that minimum [[Standards Of Interoperability]] be met. 

Rights, Responsibilities, and the need to Co-Operate over long periods of time give rise to the need to agree upon the "Rules of the Game" that allow the "Game" to be voluntarily played indefinitely to the benefit and satisfaction of All.
