# 4.5 Co-Operation
To accomplish what must be done and get to [[Where We Are Going]], we are going to need to do it together. 

In isolation, we all lack the total skills, resources, experience, and access that is required to truly transform towards The Goal. 

This gives rise to an inherent need to [[Co-Operate]]. 

[[Co-Operate|Co-Operation]], if it is going to occur over indefinitely long periods of times, requires that minimum [[Standards Of Interoperability]] be met. This includes defining the [[Rights And Responsibilities]] of each Participant in the System. 

The need to Co-Operate indefinitely gives rise to the need to agree upon the "Rules of the Game" that allow the "Game" to be voluntarily played indefinitely to the benefit and satisfaction of All.  

The Rules of the Game in voluntary co-operatives are akin to Rule of Law in a community.
