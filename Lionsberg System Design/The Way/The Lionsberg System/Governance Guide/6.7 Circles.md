# 6.7 Circles
To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, Individuals [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Circles]] and [[Communities]].   

The [[Lionsberg System]] respects the Sovereignty and Autonomy of [[Circles]] composed by Voluntarily Associating Individuals. 

Circles inalienably possess all inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] defined in the System, via the Individuals that compose them. 

Each Circle should do their best to [[Co-Operate]] a [[Circle Instance]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Circle Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating at every [[Fractal]] level. 

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, [[Circles]] [[Organize and Federate]] by forming Sub-Circles and Super-Circles. As they do this, they become [[Organizations]] and [[Communities]].
