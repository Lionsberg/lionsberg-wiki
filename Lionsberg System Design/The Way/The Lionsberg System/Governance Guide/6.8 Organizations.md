# 6.8 Organizations
To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, Individuals and Circles [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Organizations]] and [[Communities]].    

The [[Lionsberg System]] respects the Sovereignty and Autonomy of [[Organizations]] composed of Voluntarily Associating Individuals and Circles. 

[[Organizations]] inalienably possess all inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] defined in the System, via the Individuals that ultimately compose them. 

Each Organization should do their best to [[Co-Operate]] an [[Organization Instance]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Organization Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating at every [[Fractal]] level. 

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, [[Circles]] [[Organize and Federate]] by forming Sub-Circles and Super-Circles. As they do this, they become [[Organizations]] and [[Communities]].
