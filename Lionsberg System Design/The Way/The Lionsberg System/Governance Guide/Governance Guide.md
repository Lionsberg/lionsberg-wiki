# Governance Guide
In [[A New Sovereignty]], we posited that it is both possible and necessary for us to transcend the divisions and dysfunctions of the Old, in order to forge a New Sovereignty. 

We posited that process would reciprocally unfurl itself through the right balance and combination of being / relationship, and doing / action.  

We are forging a [[Meta Community]] because in isolation, it is impossible to do what must be done. 

We are forging a [[Meta Project]] because that community must become pragmatically capable of solving the total set of grand challenges, accomplishing the total set of global goals, and forging the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

We are forging a [[Meta Game]] because each and every member of the Community without exception must be able to understand and play the Game. 

The purpose of this Guide is help Sovereign Citizens understand how to rightly [[Navigate]] the [[Vessel of Society]] towards its [[Destiny]]. 

## Governance of the Old
If we were to [[All]] gather in a clean New meeting place and coordinate our activities, over a short period of time we would come to be entirely in possession of all the Old structures and positions of power. This could be accomplished in large part by using their own mechanisms to shine light into all the dark places, expose the corruption, hold them accountable, and vote into power only those true and wise leaders who were fully aligned with the Goal of the New. 

If this movement sweeps the globe, this can be accomplished in a single generation. 

This is going to require concerted effort on two fronts: 

1. Active engagement and participation in every election around the world to get the Old / corrupt voted out, and genuine servant leaders aligned with the New voted in. 
2. The use of whatever systems of justice are present in each country to charge and hold accountable those who do not honor the New Code. 

Action on these two fronts will require the creation of significantly powerful machines / platforms to accomplish each. 

The platform / machine for causing the right people to be elected in all places and all times must be functionally capable of doing so, in all places and times. 

The platform / machine for holding corrupt and exploitative individuals accountable for their actions must be functionally capable of doing so, in all places and times. 

And these platforms must be entirely reflective of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for [[All]], as determined by the local people actually present in each time and each place.  

These two platforms will be critical [[Trim Tab|Trim Tabs]] for steering the [[Vessel of Society]] as we navigate the transition from the [[Old]] to the [[New]]. 

## Governance of the New
The overwhelmingly more powerful and first condition that makes it possible for us to Navigate the [[Vessel of Society]] towards its [[Destiny]] is to forge a higher order system of governance for the [[New]]. 

Only the [[New]] is truly capable of the kind of transformational course correction that is required.  The [[Old]] will simply never be able to be turned in time. 

So we therefore must create, in the [[Wise Right]] Way, a successor system of governance to navigate the [[Meta Community]] and [[Meta Project]] towards their [[Meta Goal]]. 

## The Limitations of the Old Systems
The [[Old World]] had a strange mix of legacy systems of varying degrees of corruption and cleanliness, function and dysfunction. None of them worked to our satisfaction. 

Out of times of danger and chaos, we sometimes looked to Kings or other Totalitarian forms of government. These had the benefit of an individual who could act rapidly and without consultation. This was extremely effective in the short run if the ruler was good. It invariably led to ruin when power corrupted the present or successive generation of leadership. 

Minor adjustments to the rule of Tyrants led us to determine that power should not be vested in one individual, and we took steps to limit their authority. This usually led to the intentional or unintentional creation of oligarchies, who indeed did limit the unilateral power of the ruler, but shared the tendency to become corrupted by the still-too-concentrated wealth and power. 

We tried blood revolutions and chopped off the heads of the elite, only to learn that the fruit of the next government is inherent in the seeds of the revolution, and one bloody revolution always leads to the next. 

We attempted pure democracy, only to discover how easily the crowds are manipulated, swayed, and deceived, and how easy it is for majorities to opress and exploit minorities. 

We tried exiting from the system all together, and attempting to be sovereign and free by separating ourselves from society and being alone. However there is much we lack in isolation. 

We tried handing control over to a central government, who would plan for us and provide for us. Millions of us suffered and died. 

We tried creating categories and classes, assigning one another to them on some basis, and then establishing class-based systems. We discovered that people hate being treated as a number in a class, and that class based systems devolve to disrespect and tremendous suffering. 

We tried representative democracy, in which individuals would vote for representatives who contended for positions of power. However we discovered a continually degrading quality of candidates, and a continually rising corrupted political elite. Over time it devolved into massive  unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy, appointed by the subservient politicians that the political and economic elite allowed to run.  

We tried tribal governance, however we discovered that without an overarching and uniting structure, identity, and law of some kind, we were constantly at war with the "enemy" "out there".  

We tried to subordinate everything to capital and shareholder interest, trusting that the markets would sort it out over time, yet by the time the markets began to understand and price in the exploitation, the people and the earth had been raped and pillaged. 

We tried nationalizing the corrupt corporations, however we discovered that governments cannot efficiently operate what founders build. 

So we auctioned them off and ended up back in oligarchy. 

We tried massively strong central party governance by the elite, however we again discovered that absolute power corrupts, and they were willing to enslave and exploit millions to accomplish their goals. 

We tried forging a United Nations, however it suffered through subsequent generations, was beset by the corrupt governments represented within it, and proved ultimately incapable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in our lives and our world. 

We tried creating political parties, but discovered that they too became corrupt centers of power that lied, sowed division, and failed to accomplish the Goal. 

And so we were left wondering... How will we govern the New? 

## How Now Shall We Govern Ourselves? 
The amazing thing about the New was that because it was New, we could attempt to act out and implement anything we could imagine. 

So we resolved to attempt to do our best to not repeat the failed mistakes of history, to not accept at face value any of the [[Old]] solutions, and to attempt to forge a [[New Way]]. 

We resolved that we would attempt to create a system that retained the best features and benefits of the [[Old]], while simultaenously developing and adding the substantial [[New]] capabilities required to accomplish the Goal. 

We further determined that the New System, if it were to succeed, would need to extend out, hear from, and lift up every being on earth. 

## Principles

### Principle 1: Sovereignty
Every individual, and every voluntary association of individuals, is sovereign, autonomous, and free. 

### Principle 2: Organization and Federation
Sovereign individuals should voluntarily [[Organize and Federate]] in order to accomplish things together that they cannot accomplish in isolation. 

### Principle 3: Community
All individuals, organizations, and federations should co-exist and rightly relate to one another in the context of a harmonious Community. 

### Principle 4: A Continuously Improving System 
Success and happiness should be secured by designing, implementing, and continuously improving a system purpose-built to bring about that end. 

### Principle 5: Co-Operation
The System should be co-operated by All members of the Community. 

### Principle 6: Individual and Local Strength
Rather than creating central dependency, the System should make the individual and local as strong and resilient as possible. 

### Principle 7: Helping One Another Rise
Because none of us are as strong and capable as we could be, the System should be designed so that all individuals and localities are incentivized to help all other individuals and localities rise to the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony. 

### Principle 8: Shared Services and Infrastructure
Because the vast majority of problems, needs, and opportunities are common to All, we should pool resources and coordinate our efforts in order to created shared services and infrastructure that will help us All advance towards the Goal. 

### Principle 9: Unity of Intention and Goal
We should all aim in the same direction, towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for All. 

### Principle 10: Unity in the Essentials
In the essential things required for all elements of the System / Community to Interoperate, we should strive towards a continously improving unity. 

### Principle 11: Diversity in the Non-Essentials
In the non-essentials, we should celebrate and promote the greatest amount of richness and diversity possible. 

### Principle 12: Alignment and Co-Ordination
Since we are all heading in the same direction towards the same [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]], we should co-ordinate and align our energy and resources into some form of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. 

### Principle 13: Do Not Harm
Knowing the things that would harm us, or have harmed us in the past, we should not do those things, either individually or collectively. See [[Patterns of Failure]]. 

### Principle 14: Fractal Consistency Throughout 
The wisdom, principles, and values that apply to the individual also apply to the family, to the team, to the group, to the organization, to the community, and to the [[Meta Community]]. 

### Principle 15: Getting A Little Better Every Day
Because we do not know the best answer, either for ourselves or for subsequent generations, the entire System / Community should be designed and built to simultaneously embody our [[Current Best Understanding]], while continously learning, improving and transforming itself towards the Goal. 

### Principle 16: [[One]] Highest Authority and Law
Across all generations, all places, and all times, there is only [[One]] [[Absolute]] Authority and Law, and it is the [[One]] Source and Sustainer of [[All]]. The [[Absolute]] cannot be concretized or turned into an idol or a set of propositions. It must be wrestled with as the Mystery and Goal we are trying to rightly relate to. The unwritten and eternal [[Absolute]] is superordinate to every written law or human authority. We must always be free to disobey or transform the articulated rules in order to do what is right. However our [[Current Best Understanding]] and articulation of the rules should only be broken with great care, and full willingness to accept the consequences. 

### Principle 17: Old / Subordinate Authorities
While the [[Old]] authorities are subordinate to us as individuals striving towards right relationship with [[One]] and [[All]], nevertheless in order to preserve the benefits of the [[Old]] while we establish the [[New]], and avoid an unnecessary descent into chaos, we should strive to honor and support the approximately just systems and authorities of the [[Old World]], even in their imperfection, while actively working together to transform and transcend them. The fruit of the [[New]] cannot be born out of the seeds of restlessness or revolution. We must descend into the depths, if we can, to raise up the dying Old to New life. It is the combined strength of the [[Old]] and the [[New]] that is the [[Wise Right]] Way towards the [[Best Possible Future]]. Even as you bring forth the [[New]], beware if you rashly kill the Spirit of the Father and Tradition, lest you find yourself alone in the midst of the wolves.
