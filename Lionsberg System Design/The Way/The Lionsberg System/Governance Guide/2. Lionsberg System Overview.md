# 2. Lionsberg System Overview
Lionsberg has created an integrated and comprehensive [[Lionsberg System|System]] to serve, connect, and empower a distributed network of individuals, organizations, and initiatives to accomplish our shared overarching and uniting set of goals.

### Intention / Aim / Goal 
The [[Meta Intention]] of the [[Lionsberg System]] is [[Love]].

The [[Meta Goal]] / [[Aim]] derived from Love could be articulated as (something like) _the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life and consciousness._ 

### Mission
Our overarching and uniting Mission is to Progressively [[Realize]] [[The Goal]]. 

### Quest
The Mission unfolds like a [[Quest]] towards the object of Greatest Worth. 

This imagery empowers Individuals, Organizations, and Communities to align their individual and local Quests with the [[Meta Quest]] towards the [[Meta Goal]]. 

### Navigating FROM -> TO
The word “Govern” derives from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. It begs the question: 

_How do we collectively navigate our Vessel towards The Goal?_  

Having fixed our [[Aim]], how do we get from [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]? 

The Lionsberg System was created as an answer to this question.
