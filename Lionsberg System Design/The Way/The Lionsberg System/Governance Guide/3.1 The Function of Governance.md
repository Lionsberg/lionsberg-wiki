# 3.1 The Function of Governance
The function of a Governance System is to Navigate the Vessel towards its Destiny / Goal. 

This requires establishing comprehensive structure, culture and process that is protective and purposeful, and accomplishes what is needed given the social, economic, and political nature of the mission and goal. 

The Governance Infrastructure must be simultaneously simple and understandable enough that it can be participated in by All and robust enough to protect the System against all forms of co-option or erosion by internal or external forces, while promoting transparency and accountability by, among, and between all members of the Community.
