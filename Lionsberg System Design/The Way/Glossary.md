## Mapping

We use "mapping" to mean the collection and collation of a set of data -- for instance, projects, some information about them, including project participants.

The collected data, in a database, is a "map" of projects we know about.

Then, various visualizations -- tabular reports, graph network visualizations, geolocated positions -- can be generated from the data.

We note the difference between our use of "map" to mean data+visualizations, and the common meaning of "map", which is generally a visual representation, particularly of geography, often without a separate data table or database.
