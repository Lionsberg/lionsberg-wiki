- and if you resonate with that HOW come join us... 
- This is HOW republicans want to address the issues, democrats, both parties and sides see the issue, want better life society community, dissagreeing on how, here is where I see wisdom adn flaws in each, and a proposed plan that incorporates the essence of what needs to get done... the how that reconcilces the mom and dad, male and female, conservative and liberal... 
- The part missing - is the HOW... 
- which creates concerns questions confusion... 
- on meetings - we agree what the issues are - we are wondering HOW you are going to move forward to address the issues... 
- that is why there is conflict, leading even to civil and international war - because we violently disagree on how we go about fixing the issues
- movement of meeting this time in history, where we all agree the division is toxic, and that with tech nuclear bombs social media division has become more toxic and acute than ever
- we agree on what the issues are famine dirty water pollution environmental collapse... everyone agrees, if you don't ... of course we agree... 
- warring and fighting on how we go about fixing
- and meanwhile the corrupt leaders engaged in wrong relationship with other corrpt leaders using power to harm, starve, oppress... 
- so we the people need to rise up and unite in a way that is helpful... 
- It is asking people to join together and meet this time in history because division and chaos has become so palpable... 
- we agree on the issues... 
- lets divise a plan on how to meet those issues for each unique culture country, answers will look different in each place... 
- problems and issues are universal... 
- solutions are universal 
- how they get implemented in each place will be unique.. 
- help each individual and community rise into their unique potential, recognizing the same basic needs, and as God uniquely meets our needs, our heart is uniquely meet the needs in a way we are all doing it together...

## Universal Values 

Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom 

## Universal Goals 

Ensuring that all families and ecosystems have access to the help, resources and services they need to develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in a properly ordered society. And ensuring that our properly ordered society is integrated and aligned with a properly ordered and flourishing natural world. 

## The Grand Challenges 


## The Chasm 
There is a vast chasm separating humanity from its shared goals and values. 

## Proposed Solution 

We have created a bridge to help humanity cross the chasm that separates us from our destiny. 

The Lionsberg System is a successor system that invites us to bring forward and incorporate the best features and benefits of all our existing systems, while affording us significant new capabilities that will enable us to build a properly ordered society, in a properly ordered world.   

This is accomplished by forging a higher order functional unity out of our siloed and disparate efforts and institutions. 

## Overarching and Uniting Campaign Narrative: 

Welcome to our shared movement towards a better future. 

Our vision is a properly ordered society, in a properly ordered world, where every family, community, and ecosystem has the opportunity to achieve their full potential and flourish in harmony. 

This movement is built upon the belief that everyone deserves to live a life of purpose and fulfillment. A life in which each of us has the opportunity to develop towards our potential and not just survive, but thrive.  

Our nation, our society, and our world are at a crossroads. From where we are today, it is possible for things to get unimaginably better, or unimaginably worse. We believe that our future can be brighter in every way than the past we are leaving behind. But this can only occur if we work together to change our trajectory, and realign ourselves in service of our highest shared goals and values.

That is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign to forge a new and united Force For Good. A Force strong enough that it can actually rise up to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in great and tragic story of our human species aboard planet earth. 

This will require taking action at a historic scale to address the crises facing us, such as poverty, inequality, environmental collapse, political instability and conflict, mental and physical wellbeing, and social, political, and economic injustice. 

This total complex of crises also presents us with historic opportunities to make a positive difference in the world, to learn and grow, to work together towards common goals and values, to help others, and to create something new and good. 

Our goal is to forge a properly ordered society out of the present chaos and disorder, and to ensure that our human society is properly reintegrated with nature and its Source so that all generations of life can thrive in harmony. 

To accomplish this, we are proposing an unprecedented set of public-private joint ventures. These joint ventures will ensure that every family on earth has access to the basic goods and services that all families need. By working together to meet the needs and solve the problems faced by families around the world, we will open up the opportunity to focus on higher order objectives, like proper long-term stewardship of our culture and environment.

We are also proposing a new paradigm of stewardship of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and nuclear power. This new paradigm will ensure that these technologies will be used only in service of life, and that the value they create will be properly distributed throughout society.

This will require a new era of public-private partnership, shifting power away from opaque and unaccountable bureaucracies and empowering the private sector with the kinds of resources, support, and technologies found in our shared governments. This shift will put government back in service of the people, and the people back in service of helping life and society flourish.

To achieve this new paradigm, mission, and vision, we have designed and built the foundations of a new system called Lionsberg. Lionsberg is a story of a global community who, at a critical inflection point in human history, arose and united to co-create a better future. It is also a solid and pragmatic system, platform, and technology to make this story our reality.

The Lionsberg System is a successor system that invites us to bring forward and incorporate the best features and benefits of all existing systems, while affording us significant new capabilities. These capabilities will enable us to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this moment in history.   

We believe that a comprehensive new vision, system, and plan is the only answer to the interrelated crises facing our communities and our world. 

To launch the movement and lead by example, I am running for United States President as an independent candidate in 2024. The people of America and the world have entrusted the United States with unprecedented power and authority on earth, and it is time that we rediscover what it means to dawn the mantle of servant leadership and responsibility, and use it to lift up humanity and the earth. 

This is an unusual and unorthodox strategy, but historic times call for historic measures. 

We hope that you will join us in this movement and campaign towards a better future. The world needs all of us to work together to solve our grand challenges, and accomplish our global goals. Together, we can create a world that is more just, more loving, and more wise - a world that is a suitable dwelling place for all generations of life to develop towards the fullness of their unique potential and flourish together. 

Thank you for your support, and for your deep commitment to building a brighter future for All.

The next steps are to begin connecting, serving, and empowering the vast array of unique local, community, and sectoral efforts we are all engaged in. Together, we are capable of achieving far more than any of us can in isolation. 

We would be honored to have your support to help make this effort a success.
