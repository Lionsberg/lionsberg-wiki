# Guiding Principles

This thread is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

The Lionsberg System is rooted in universal principles. 

Principles, not politics, will guide our lives and society from hence forth. 

There is no definitive list of guiding principles for life and society. A proper mode of being and doing must be guided not by a fixed dogmatic articulation, but by Spirit. 

Depending on how broadly or narrowly each principle is defined, a list of guiding principles could be one, several, several dozen, several hundred, or several thousand. 

Because universal principles flow from one Spirit, they are not mutually exclusive, and they all interconnect and overlap in various. They are like parts of one integrated personality. 

It is the spirit and consciousness of each individual that must mediate between a potentially infinite array of principles, situations, beings, and patterns of action in order to find the pattern of action most appropriately suited to that person, time, and place. 

## Definition of Principle 

A principle is a fundamental rule or law that serves as a basis for a system or method of behavior or conduct. Principles are typically based on values or beliefs that are considered to be important or fundamental, and are used to guide decisions and actions.

For example, in the context of a society, principles might include values such as respect for human rights, fairness and justice, and compassion. These principles can serve as a guide for how people within that society should behave and interact with one another, and can help to create a sense of shared values and purpose within the community.

Principles can also be used to guide decision-making in other contexts, such as in business or personal relationships. In these cases, principles might include values such as honesty, integrity, and responsibility.

In general, principles are intended to provide guidance and direction for behavior, and to help people make decisions that are consistent with their values and goals.

## Central Animating Spirit or Ethos 

The [[Central Animating Spirit]] or [[Ethos]] of an individual, community, or society refers to the unifying spirit that gives rise to the underlying values and beliefs that shape its culture and way of life. It is the driving force behind the actions and behaviors of the people within that society, and helps to create a sense of shared purpose and identity.

Each individual unit of society is inexhaustibly complex, with a complex array of interrelated beliefs, values, principles, and drives, many of which are opaque or subconscious. 

Because the complex and interrelated hierarchy of principles and drives cannot be fully articulated, it is often better thought of and grappled with as a 'guiding spirit' or 'essence' that is not static, but transforming over time. 

The central animating spirit or ethos of a society can be shaped by a variety of factors, including its history, cultural traditions, religious beliefs, and shared experiences. It can also be influenced by the principles and values that are most important to the people within that society, such as fairness, justice, compassion, and respect for human rights.

Because the central animating spirit cannot be articulated, to know it we must look to the behaviors and outcomes manifesting as a consequence of it. The central animating spirit or ethos of a society is often reflected in the way that people within that society interact with one another, and in the behaviors and attitudes that are considered acceptable or unacceptable. It can also be seen in the laws and policies that are put in place to govern the society, as well as in the way that people within that society view and understand the world around them. Most importantly, it can be seen in the "fruit" or outcomes manifesting from each particular "tree of life". 

## Relationship of Spirit, Ethos, and Principles 

Principles and the central animating spirit or ethos of a society or community are closely related, as the principles that guide a society reflect its core values and beliefs, and its core values and beliefs reflect its unifying guiding spirit. 

The central animating spirit or ethos of a society can be thought of as the underlying set of values and beliefs that shape its culture and way of life. 

Articulated principles help to give concrete form to the central animating spirit or ethos of a society, providing a set of guidelines for behavior and decision-making that are based on the values and beliefs that are most important to that society. In this way, principles can help to create a sense of shared purpose and unity within a community or society, and to ensure that people are acting in accordance with the values that are most important to them.

## The One Meta Principle 

For any personality or society to not be fragmented, anxious, and divided against itself, it must have one unifying principle that integrates, coheres, and orders within itself all other principles. This gives rise to the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Principles]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Principle]]. 

In the Lionsberg System, that principle is simply referred to as [[One]], which is conceptually equivalent to [[God]] or [[Ultimate Reality]]. 

[[One]], or [[God]], or the [[Creator]], is the [[Ultimate Reality]] that integrates, coheres, and orders within itself the total set of [[All]] things that rise from, are sustained by, and return to It. 

This is not a dogmatic or religious claim, but a philosophical, psychological, and conceptual necessity. 

## All Principles 

From [[One]], we can move out to [[All]]. Flowing from [[One]] [[Creator]], is [[All]] [[Creation]]. 

1. [[One]] - [[Creator]]   
2. [[All]] - [[Creation]] 

In these two conceptual realities exist [[All]] things, and the Source from which they flow. 

## The Principle of Absolute and Unconditional Love 

Across a vast array of religious and wisdom traditions, the highest guiding principle, or the central animating spirit of God, has been articulated as something like [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

Therefore the universal guiding principle can be articulated as something like: 

_Love [[One]] and [[All]] as you love your [[Self]]._  

The [[Love]] and [[Right Relationship]] between [[One]] and [[All]] is the proper central animating spirit and ethos for all life and society.
