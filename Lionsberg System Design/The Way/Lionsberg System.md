# Lionsberg System
Lionsberg is a mission and values driven community working together to co-create the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

Producing the [[Best Possible Future]] requires a [[System]] that empowers us to [[Co-Operate]] in [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is a comprehensive and integrated [[System]] designed to produce [[Throughput]] of our One overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]]. 

It is designed to connect, empower, and accelerate All other things moving in service of [[The Goal]]. 

It is not a finished answer, blueprint or silver bullet. It is not the one right answer. It is a hypothesis, a Prototype. The only Way we will be able to test how well it conforms to Ultimate Reality will be to experiment, learn, experience, embody and transform it. 

Therefore at the Core of the System is an identification not with the present embodiment, articulations, or hypotheses,  but with the Spirit and processes guiding our learning, growth, and transformation across Time. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is emerging to address all elements required for this Higher Order Functional Unity to emerge:

2. Vision & Intention - See [[Provisional Declaration]]  
3. Values - See [[Values]]

9. Process - See [[The Way]] and [[Integrated Delivery Guide]]  
10. Economy - Coming Soon

All elements of the System are designed to integrate and align [[All]] in service of [[The Goal]] that unites us All.
