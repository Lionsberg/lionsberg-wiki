# Your Story
For opening guidance on how to articulate and align [[Your Story]], please see [[The Power of Today]]. It is a short read, so we would recommend that you dive into it to get a broader and more beneficial context that leads [[Your Story]] into a Team, a Community, and a [[Daily Practice]]. 

If you want to skip directly to the content on Story, start with [[3.0 Story]]. It will begin to contextualize how Your Story and Our Story fit with the [[Meta Story]]. 

If you want to skip to any of those sections directly, please see: 

[[3.1 Your Story]]  
[[3.2 The Meta Story]]  
[[3.3 Our Story]]
