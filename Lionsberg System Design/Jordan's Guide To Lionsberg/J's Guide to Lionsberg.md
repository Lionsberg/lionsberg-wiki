[[Beloved Co-Creators]], 

Welcome to [[The Bridge Between Worlds]].   

Our Mission is simple: We have only a few years remaining to move humanity FROM the [[Old World]] TO the [[New World]], with no one [[Involuntarily Left Behind]].  

Our [[Tipping Point Strategy]] begings with [[The First Three Percent]]. 

How many of Us, how quickly, can exit [[The Caves]] and [[Cross The Chasm]]? How many of Us will make it through [[The Wilderness]] and into [[The Promised Land]]? 

As the [[Existing Order]] accelerates into [[The Collapse]], how many billions of lives can be saved?
