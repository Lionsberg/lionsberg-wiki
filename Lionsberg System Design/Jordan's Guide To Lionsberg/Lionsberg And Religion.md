# Lionsberg And Religion
Lionsberg is very intentionally _not_ written from the perspective of any particular religion. 

Yet it also very intentionally grapples with the [[Deepest]] things that religions were created to point towards. 

Trying to walk this balance and articulate this [[New Language]] has caused quite a bit of confusion already. 

For people from a particular fundamentalist religious or ideological background, any language that is different than the language used in their dogma is triggering and sounds like heresy. 

For people who do not associate with a particular religion, any words that begin to approach the realm of [[God]] / [[One]] can sound cultish or elementary. 

It might be the wrong approach, and it might not work, but being simultaneously compelled to speak to [[All]] about [[One]] thing... we cannot think of any other way _it might work_ other than to do the hard work of forging a transcendent [[New Language]] that will allow us to communicate accurately with New [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] as we labor together to [[Co-Create]] the [[New World]]. 

Lastly, by avoiding any narrow religious interpretation or set of human propositions, we avoid committting the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that occurs when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]], rather than humbly relating to It as an eternal Mystery that will be forever beyond our grasp.
