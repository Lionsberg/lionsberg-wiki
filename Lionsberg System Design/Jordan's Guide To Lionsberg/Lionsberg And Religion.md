# Lionsberg And Religion

Lionsberg is very intentionally _not_ written from the perspective of any particular religion. 

Yet it also very openly and intentionally grapples with the [[Deepest]] things that religions were created to point towards. 

Trying to walk this balance and articulate this [[New Language]] has caused quite a stir already. 

For people from a particular fundamentalist religious or ideological background, any language that is different than the language used in their dogma is triggering and sounds like heresy. 

For people who do not associate with a particular religion, any words that begin to approach the realm of [[God]] / [[ONE]] can sound cultish or elementary. 

Being simultaneously compelled to speak to [[All]] about [[ONE]] thing... We are working to co-create a transcendent [[New Language]] that will allow us to communicate accurately with New [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] as we collaborate to [[Co-Create]] the [[New World]]. 

Lastly, by avoiding any narrow religious interpretation or set of human propositions, we avoid succumbing to the [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that occurs when we [[Concretizing The Absolute|Concretize The Absolute]], rather than humbly relating to [[ONE]] and [[All]] as eternal Mysteries that will be forever beyond our grasp.
