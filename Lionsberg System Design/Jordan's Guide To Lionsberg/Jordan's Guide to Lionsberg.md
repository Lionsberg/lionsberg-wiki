# Jordan's Guide To Lionsberg
Hello friends, 

Welcome to a bridge between worlds. 

I am writing this Guide from my personal perspective as one of the primary Authors of Lionsberg, so that if anyone gets lost or confused in the mythical story they can directly know what I have in mind instead of guessing. 

In a time of deepening polarization and division, my [[Current Best Understanding]] is that bridging divides and forging the [[Best Possible Future]] will require that we find ways to move beyond the triggering and emotionally charged language we are divided by, into a realm of story, experience, community, and action that can begin to bring us back together. 

To aid in that process, I am offering up my life and my story in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

I was also led to begin co-creating a mythical [[New World]] called [[Lionsberg]], including its inherent [[Lionsberg System|Systems]]. 

## A Personal Story As A Bridge
If you'd like to know more about where the story originates from, my life is an open book, and I would be happy to share it with you. It may be that the more you get to know me, the more the mythical story I am living in and telling will make sense.

## A Mythical Story As A Bridge
The more I grew to understand the eternal and universal Story, the more I came to understand that it had to be incarnated here, on Earth, in our own perceived time and place. 

Because it cannot be told or understood literally, the Story has to be told mythologically.  

While it is an extraordinary challenge, I was deeply compelled to begin co-creating a mythical place called Lionsberg in which we could begin to act out the propositions, Logic, and Way of Being in the [[New World]]. 

If enough people simply decided to act it out, as if it were a game we could voluntarily choose to play together, it would actually in-break, displace the [[Old]], and become our present Reality. 

The [[Story of Lionsberg]] is the story of an epic Quest out of the bondage and suffering of the [[Old World]], into an entirely regenerated [[New World]].  

It is an experiment. It might work. 

## Your Story
If it is going to work, I am going to need your help, and I am going to need you to creatively weave your own story into the [[Meta Story]] that is unfolding through us. 

Would you be willing to in engage in an experiment with me and see what happens? The world needs you, and you have a unique and important role to play. The [[New World]] cannot become our Reality until we [[All]] decide to play the same overarching and uniting Game, and live in the same overarching and uniting Story.

## Why Write This Guide
At first, Lionsberg may appear confusing or disorienting, especially as it is being co-created openly and transparently as part of the Story. 

One of the most confusing parts initially, that I hope will be among the most helpful parts in the end, is the [[Language of Lionsberg]]. 

In the short term, it would have been far easier to adopt an existing set of Language to talk about the [[Most Important Things]]. However we discovered that by using existing words, we immediately lost and alienated everyone who had been programmed to think those were the words of the enemy. 

We considered the approach taken by many families: Do not discuss religion, politics, or the [[Deepest]] things. 

However it appears obvious that our systems of belief and ways of organizing and governing ourselves are among the principle causes of our present division and suffering.  

So it might not work... everyone might get confused and run away... but despite the risks I am following my deep intuition that bringing us all back together is going to require that we find our unique places in an epic Story big enough to unite us all. 

The language in [[The Book of Lionsberg]] and throughout the [[Lionsberg System]] is written from the standpoint of "We". As an individual I cannot comment or speak from the [[Voice of Lionsberg]]. 

So I am writing this guide from the standpoint of an Author and Co-Creator of the Story to let you know what I think the Story is about, and what I believe is trying emerge through it.

## Lionsberg and Religion
Lionsberg can be a confusing place at first because it intently focuses on and grapples with the [[Deepest]] and [[Most Important Things]], while not subordinating those discussions to any one religion. 

Over time Lionsberg will begin functioning in all the ways that any community or nation must function. One of the critical lessons from history is the importance of preserving the Freedom for each individual to rightly relate to God and the world around them in their own unique way, without being subordinated to any one [[State Religion]] or Ideology. 

If you would like to know more about how I personally think about this, see [[Lionsberg And Religion]]. 

## My Faith 
If you are curious about my personal journey and experience with Faith, please see [[Jordan and Faith]]. And please know that whatever your background and beliefs, I love you and I appreciate you because God loves and appreciates you. You are my family. We [[All]] flow from [[One]] [[Source and Sustainer]] of our life, our breath, and our consciousness. Everyone who wants to be here is welcome to the banquet table that has been prepared, regardless of where any of us are on our [[Quest]]. [[Jordan and Faith]].
