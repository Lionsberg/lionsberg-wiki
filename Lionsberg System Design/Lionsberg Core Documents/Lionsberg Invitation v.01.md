# Lionsberg Invitation v.0.1

Fellow Citizen, 

We are part of an emergent Community, System, and Approach called Lionsberg. 

The purpose of Lionsberg is to inspire, connect, serve, and empower citizens of Goodwill to meet the needs, solve the problem, and capture the opportunities at hand. 

Lionsberg is a completely independent and international system, ecosystem and movement that is not part of or subordinate to any existing institution, party, or ideology. It was founded, funded, and purpose-built by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a network of allies to address the unfolding [[Meta Crisis]], and design and build the better future we all aspire to. 

Our first two membership cohorts, one international and one emerging out of Kenya, are embarking on the Lionsberg Orientation and Training Process the week of May 21st. Membership in Lionsberg is invitation only. Invitations to subsequent membership cohorts will be issued by members of the Pioneer Cohort. 

You are receiving this invitation because you have expressed interest, and are being invited by Jordan to join the Pioneer Membership Cohort. Our Quest will be to venture out together into the Unknown, confront and overcome obstacles and challenges as they presence themselves, and forge the roadways, bridges, and infrastructure that will make it easier for all future cohorts to progress alongside of us. 

The adventure will be challenging and daunting at times, however if successful has the potential to transform our lives and our world for the better. 

If you would like to join the Pioneer Membership Cohort and take up the extraordinary rights, responsibilities, and opportunities that will emerge as a result, please respond to Jordan by 10AM on May 23rd. 

For additional information and access to the Field of Agreements that will govern our Quest at the outset, please see Jordan's travel log from [[The Lionsberg Experience - Day 9]]. 

With Love, Faith, and Hope, 

~ J
