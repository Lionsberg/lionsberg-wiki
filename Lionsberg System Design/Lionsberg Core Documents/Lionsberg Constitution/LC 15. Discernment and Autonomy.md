# LC 15. Discernment and Autonomy

Unlike the agreements of the past, which were mediated by kings, governors, priests, and courts, this New Covenant is mediated through direct right relationship between the Creator and each unique Created Individual. 

In the New Covenant, there is no royalty or high priesthood to which Citizens must submit. Every created being is invited into direct, personal right relationship with the Creator, One Another, and All Creation. 

Recognizing the aspect of the Creator present in the Consciousness of each unique Individual, the New System of Governance is based not on top down rule, compulsion, or control, but on sovereignty, autonomy, discernment, right relationship, and voluntary collaboration and cooperation from the bottom up. 

This revolution in human governance pushes all power, responsibility and authority on Earth out away from the corrupted centers that have accumulated it in the past, and places it back in the hands of the Citizens of Earth, as One Citizenship Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All. 

This decentralized and rightly related redistribution of power and authority demands that each of the billions of citizens and millions of localities understand and embody the universal and eternal [[Pattern Language]] of Spirit, Intention, Wisdom, Values, Principles and Practices that cause people, society, and the Living System to flourish in harmony.
