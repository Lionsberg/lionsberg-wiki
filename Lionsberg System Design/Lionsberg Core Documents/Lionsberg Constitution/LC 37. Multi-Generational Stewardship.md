# LC 37. Multi-Generational Stewardship

The Lionsberg System is designed to facilitate the multi-generational stewardship of the New World we are co-creating. 

All children of Citizens under the age of 15 years may become Provisional Citizens at the request of their parent or Guardian. Provisional Citizens have the right to voluntarily take up or revoke full Citizenship when they reach the Age of Consent at 18 years old, and after 3 years of Membership. 

At 15, young adults are eligible for Membership. After 3 years of Membership and reaching the age of 18, individuals are eligible for Citizenship. 

Full Citizenship is not automatically granted, but rather is extended only to consenting adults who have completed the course of Membership and training, and voluntarily agree to take up the [[Rights and Responsibilities]] associated with Citizenship in Lionsberg. 

Upon becoming a Citizen, each Citizen becomes Equal to All other Citizens without class or discrimination. 

Each generation of Citizens is responsible for continually nurturing, cultivating, and Passing the Flame to [[Future Generations]].
