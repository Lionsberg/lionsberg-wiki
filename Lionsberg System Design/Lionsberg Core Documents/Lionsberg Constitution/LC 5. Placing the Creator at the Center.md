# LC 5. Placing the Creator at the Center

*2024.05.17 Draft For Review and Improvement*

We acknowledge that beyond the One Living System that contains us All is the [[One]] creating, sustaining, and guiding All of its subsequent manifestations and transformations across time and space. 

We confess that we have so corrupted and abused the [[Word Tools]] we use to point to this [[Ultimate Reality]] that words like [[God]] and [[Creator]] have become divisive, misunderstood, and alienating rather than uniting to many. 

Nevertheless, we understand that our continued existence as a civilization is dependent upon the resurrection, rediscovery, and reclamation of the knowledge of the [[One]] that unites us [[All]]. 

Therefore, while transcending and liberating our Selves from the arrogant and elementary ideas and false constructs about [[That Which Creates And Sustains The Universe]] that have separated and divided us in the past, we humbly stand together in awe of the inexhaustible and ineffable Mystery of the Creator and all Creation, and reverentially reorient our Selves towards eternal Right Relationship and reunion with the [[One]] in whom [[All]] subsequent generations of life live, move, breathe, and have their being. 

Understanding that there is only [[One]] Deepest and Highest Being, Spirit, Ideal and Goal capable of uniting us [[All]], we hereby reexalt and place the [[Creator]] back at the Center and Highest Place in the Lionsberg System, our lives, and our world.
