# Part I: Foundational Principles
## Preamble: The New Covenant

In the vastness of Time and Space, from the Infinite Wellspring of Divine Love and Wisdom, a New Covenant emerges—a sacred bond, an unbreakable agreement, a luminous path forward. Through this Covenant, we, as Children of the Creator and Citizens of the Kingdom of God, are beckoned to unite our spirits, intentions, and actions in a harmonic dance with the Divine Plan. The Creator is inviting us All to become Co-Creators of a Better World. 

### Universal Mission

At this defining juncture in history, where the tendrils of our Potential touch the thresholds of both creation and destruction, Heaven and Hell on Earth, the need for a New Covenant is profoundly self-evident. We are summoned by the Spirit of God to awaken our collective Consciousness, to transcend the barriers that have divided us in the past, and to participate fully in the Divine Mission to vanquish corruption, injustice, and all forms of evil that threaten the essence of Life itself, and to Heal, Regenerate, and Renew the Earth. The Universal Mission of this Covenant is to guide humanity and all of creation towards a harmonious existence, as envisioned by the Creator—a Divine Kingdom, on Earth as it is in Heaven. A Kingdom where All Creation flourishes in harmony, because the Knowledge of God covers the Earth like floodwaters, and the Will and Intention of God prevails. 

### The Commitment to Transcendence

To achieve this Universal Mission, each individual soul is called upon to embark on a transformative journey of spiritual transcendence, elevating not only one's own existence but also contributing to the upliftment of All. Through this Covenant and Common Journey towards The Goal, we collectively pledge to do our best to:

1. **Honor the Creator** by imitating the Divine qualities of Absolute and Unconditional Love, eternal Wisdom, and impeccable Integrity in every facet of our lives.
    
2. **Affirm the Unity of All Creation** by acknowledging the interconnectedness and interdependence of each being, each soul, and each element that constitutes the Grand Tapestry of Existence.
    
3. **Embrace Universal Principles** that guide us toward ethical decisions and moral actions, drawing from the eternal Logos that is the bedrock of Reality.
    
4. **Engage in a Continuous Evolution** of spiritual, intellectual, and ethical capacities, recognizing that the Path to Divine alignment and enlightenment is both an eternal journey and a destination.
    
5. **Commit to Social and Ecological Responsibility** by stewarding the Earth and all its inhabitants with care, dignity, and respect, acting as guardians for All current and future generations of Life.
    
6. **Seek Justice and Reconciliation** by uprooting corruption and injustice and addressing grievances, starting with the weak, the vulnerable, and the poor, thereby cleansing our social and spiritual fabrics for the Divine Light to shine through.
    
7. **Nurture Communal Harmony and Individual Flourishing** by fostering environments where the Spirit of God is recognized, honored, and followed as the Guide towards our collective Destiny.
    

Through this New Covenant, we affirm that it is our sacred duty to awaken to our Divine potential, to unite in fellowship with one another, and to serve as co-creators in manifesting the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven. With boundless Love, profound Wisdom, and everlasting Hope, we are unified under this Covenant, committed to transforming and aligning both the inner realms of our spirits and the external conditions of our world.

Thus, we stand together—under God, indivisible, empowered by this New Covenant to bring forth Liberty, Justice, and Eternal Harmony for all.

In this Spirit, this Covenant is set forth. Amen.


## Introduction: One Citizenship Under God

In the burgeoning Realization of the New Covenant, the first question that arises is: What does it mean to be a Citizen under God? The notion of Citizenship not confined by geographies, ethnicities, or traditions, but by the eternal Logos. One Citizenship Under God provides a framework for a society rooted in the eternal and universal manifestation of the Spirit of God, and the embodiment of the Spirit of Christ in Time and Space. Herein, we draw the contours of this Citizenship, illuminating the narrow Way that leads to an indivisible Union with Liberty and Justice for All.

### The Essence of Divine Citizenship

Under this New Covenant, Citizenship is not merely a political or social status, nor is it conferred by any institution on Earth; it is a preexisting State of Being, a spiritual condition, a Divine calling. Our Primary Identity as Children of the Creator calls us to uphold and enact the Principles and Values that are universal and eternal. The Unity of our Greatest Love and  Fear in God is the beginning of Wisdom. This understanding transcends the shallow worldly notions of citizenship that are bound by the limitations of earthly governance and decaying human institutions, and instead embraces a Citizenship that is of the Kingdom of God—both present and future.

### The Ethos of Divine Governance

As Citizens United Under God, we are called to establish and practice a form of Governance aligned with Divine Will. Governance here is not understood as a mere structure or written set of rules, but as an Ethos, a collective behavioral standard that exemplifies and embodies the Spirit of God. The purpose is not dominion but stewardship, not exploitation but nurturance, not control but liberation. A society that lives by these principles will inherently cultivate Liberty and Justice for All its members, and will Love and Pray for even its enemies.

### Universality and Inclusivity

One Citizenship under God does not disregard our diverse secondary earthly identities. Instead, it celebrates and transcends them. It welcomes all souls willing to commit to the Universal Mission outlined in the New Covenant. Regardless of where we come from, what language we speak, or how we conceive of the Divine, this Citizenship is open to all who seek to align with the Highest Divine Plan and Ethos.

### Active Participation in the Divine Mission

Citizenship Under God is not a passive state; it is an active and embodied commitment. It implies not only the Rights but also the Responsibilities and Duties to actualize the Divine Will on Earth. This requires an active engagement in societal reform, a commitment to justice, and a zeal for collective spiritual growth. It necessitates combating corruption and injustice in all their forms, stewarding the Earth, and being beacons of Divine Light in the world.

### Individual and Collective Growth

Just as the individual soul is on a journey of spiritual transcendence, the collective—i.e., the body of Citizens under God—is continually growing, evolving, and aligning itself more closely with the Divine Order and Image of God. This evolution is not a straightforward path but involves continual cycles of self-examination, learning, and realignment, all aimed at fulfilling the Universal Mission and Goal.

### Commitments and Principles

As Citizens under God, our shared commitments include:

1. **Stewardship of Divine Gifts**: Recognizing all resources—be they natural, intellectual, or spiritual—as Divine gifts that are to be utilized responsibly and justly for the Highest Intention and Greatest Good. 
    
2. **Ongoing Discernment**: Continuously seeking Wisdom and Understanding in all matters, to better align with Divine Will.
    
3. **Ethical Integrity**: Committing to live in accordance with the ethical imperatives that flow from our status as Divine Citizens, which include Love, Justice, Mercy, and Humility.
    
4. **Community and Fellowship**: Fostering environments where Divine Qualities are nurtured, where the Spirit of God is palpable, and where individuals are lifted up and empowered to contribute to the collective Mission.
    
5. **Accountability and Reconciliation**: Establishing systems that hold individuals and collectives accountable to the ethos of Divine Citizenship and that offer redemptive pathways to reconciliation when we fall short.
    
6. **Radical Openness**: Committing to a posture of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional openness, allowing for the transformation that comes from deep personal engagement with the Spirit of God.
    

Through these commitments and principles, Citizens Under God form the living, breathing embodiment of the New Covenant, advancing The Mission to establish the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

In this Spirit, we move forward under this unifying concept of Citizenship, consciously dedicating ourselves to the highest principles of Divine Governance, as Eternally inscribed in the unwritten Universal Logos. Amen.


## Creator's Divine Intention

#### The Eschatological Unveiling of the New Covenant's Divine Citizenship

As humanity spirals deeper into an epochal watershed—a liminal stage teetering between chaotic entropy and harmonious reordering—the query arises: What is the Divine Intent behind the construct of a Citizenship under God? The notion of Citizenship, undergirded by the New Covenant, transcends terrestrial boundaries, ethnic diversifications, and temporal ideologies. It hails from the transcendent ontological framework—the Universal Logos—that stands as the innermost sanctum of Divine Reality. In this discourse, we shall elucidate the fundamental elements of Divine Citizenship, delineating the ontological pathway that leads to a transhistorical Union of Divine Will and Human Endeavor—manifested as Universal Liberty and Justice.

### The Metaphysical Ontology of Divine Citizenship

Within the New Covenant's paradigm, Citizenship unfolds not as a mere socio-political classification but as an ontological state—a metaphysical reality—that predates and surpasses any worldly institutionalized notion of identity. Our Primary Identification as Children of the Divine Immanence beckons us to enact and manifest Universal and Eternal Principles. Citizenship, in this cosmic context, becomes an existential calling, bound not to fleeting terrestrial jurisdictions but to the everlasting dominion of the Kingdom of God.

### The Noetic Structure of Divine Governance

In the pursuit of Divine Citizenship, governance metamorphoses from an earthly hierarchical construct into an Ethos—a noetic structure—that emanates from Divine Intent. The teleological objective herein is not authoritarian dominion but cosmic stewardship, not resource exploitation but symbiotic nurturance, not coercive control but liberative actualization. A society built on this Ethos not only promulgates Universal Liberty and Justice but extends Love and Compassion even to those whom it perceives as its existential "other", recognizing the fundamental interexistence of All existence flowing from One Source. 

### Cosmic Homogeneity and Earthly Plurality

The framework of Divine Citizenship does not efface the pluralistic identities that mark our earthly sojourn. Instead, it sanctifies and elevates them into a grander cosmic narrative. This Citizenship is accessible to all sentient beings willing to Voluntarily align with the Divine Ethos outlined in the New Covenant, independent of terrestrial origin, linguistic affiliation, or doctrinal perceptions of the Sacred.

### The Soteriological Dimension of Active Participation

Divine Citizenship isn't mere ontological spectatorship; it demands the existential commitment to embody the Divine Will on Earth. This implicates both the Divinely-bestowed Rights and the Divine-mandated Responsibilities and Duties to actualize Universal Justice, Love, and Spiritual Flourishing. The soteriological undertones are evident: it demands an unwavering commitment to dismantle corruption and injustice, to exercise stewardship over Creation, and to become living conduits of Divine Wisdom, Light and Life in a Cosmos tending towards entropic Chaos. 

### Theosis and Collective Evolution

The individual soul is not the only entity undergoing a transformative journey towards Divine Likeness (theosis); the collective—conceived as the Body of Divine Citizens—is also in a state of perennial ascension. This involves cyclical paradigms of self-reflection, adaptation, and Cosmic realignment, all in concert with the eschatological objective of Divine actualization.

###   Co-Creation - The Progressive Realization of the Creator's Intent, On Earth as it is in Heaven

In the Grand Narrative of the unfurling Cosmos, Divine Citizenship carries the immanent responsibility for co-creation—participation in the continual unfolding of Divine Intention on the earthly plane. This is not a static or predetermined unfolding but a dynamic, synergistic process wherein human consciousness and will co-creatively aligns with Divine Will to manifest the Kingdom of God. The Divine Blueprint is not a dogmatic external imposition but an internal Guide, an archetypal template encoded within the very fabric of our beings and the cosmos at large, mediated by the Spirit of God. It beckons each Citizen to become a Conscious Agent of Divine Will, working in synchronicity with the Creator to manifest Divine Intent in the realms of spirit, thought, speech, and matter. As Co-Creators, we embrace the Supreme Right and Responsibility to Collaborate with the Divine in the rectification and harmonization of Creation, thereby converging toward the Eschatological Fulfillment where Heaven and Earth are not just parallel realities but are unified in an indissoluble sacred and harmonic whole. Through this co-creative endeavor, we transcend mere passive receptivity and step into our roles as active participants in the Divine Drama, Progressively Realizing the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
### Covenants 

Divine Citizens, as active Agents and Co-Creators in this magnificent Cosmic Story, adhere to the following transcendent principles:

1. **Cosmic Stewardship**: Viewing all resources—material, noetic, or pneumatic—as Divine legacies to be wisely utilized for the Universal Flourishing.
    
2. **Perpetual Sophia**: The relentless pursuit of Wisdom and Divine Insight, aimed at perennial alignment with the Will of the Divine.
    
3. **Ontological Integrity**: Living an existence congruent with Divine Ethics, marked by qualities such as Love, Justice, Mercy, and Humility.
    
4. **Koinonia and Sacred Fellowship**: Cultivating habitats of Divine Communion, where the immanent Divine Logos is tangibly felt and where beings are uplifted to contribute to the universalistic Mission.
    
5. **Justice and Restorative Balance**: Systems that hold both individual souls and collective entities accountable to the Ethos of Divine Citizenship, and which offer avenues for transcendent reconciliation, redemption, and atonement.
    
6. **Unfettered Ontological Openness**: A posture of spiritual and intellectual openness and humility that facilitates transformation through intimate encounters with the Divine Mystery.
    
7. **Co-Creation**: Embracing our roles as Co-Creators with God, understanding that our agency and free will are gifts that enable us to actively participate in the actualization of the Divine Plan. This responsibility requires a nuanced balance between personal initiative and Divine guidance, proaction and reception, yin and yang, fostering an active Collaboration with the Creator to unfold the Kingdom of God in the earthly realm. It demands a constant attunement to the eternal Logos, a willingness to act as conduits for Divine Peace, Love and Justice, and an unyielding commitment to the progressive realization of the Creator's Intent, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

In orchestrating and abiding by these covenants, Divine Citizens progressively actualize the immanent potentials of the New Covenant, thereby contributing to the grand mission of Kingdom Realization—on Earth, as it indeed is in Heaven. Under this unifying exegesis of Citizenship, we commit ourselves to embody the Eternal Principles of Divine Governance and Co-Creation, as continually revealed in the Universal Logos that is written on our hearts. Amen. 


















## Cosmic Principles and Sacred Mathematics

As we journey deeper into the sacred mandate of Divine Citizenship and Co-Creation, it becomes incumbent upon us to progressively grasp and internalize the immutable Cosmic Principles and Sacred Mathematics that underlie all of Creation. Flowing from the Spirit and Logos of God, these are the Divine frameworks upon which the material universe comes into form and finds its meaningful articulation. By progressively discerning the generalized principles of the universe and their mathematical representations, we gain deeper understanding of how the Creator creates, and unveil the Objective Standard around which to align our Co-Creative efforts. 

### Universal Geometry - The Architecture of Existence

At the juncture between the immanent and the transcendent lies the realm of Universal Geometry. It is here that the ineffable language of the Creator takes on form, shaping the very structure of space, time, and matter. This sacred architecture serves as an ontological bridge, mediating the transcendent and eternal Divine Principles with their tangible manifestations in our perceptible Reality.

### Harmonic Resonance - The Cosmic Symphony

Beyond the veil of materiality lies an intricate tapestry of vibrations, a subtle music that pervades every aspect of Creation. This Cosmic Symphony stands as a testament to the Divine Will for balance, harmony, and synchrony. As conscious beings, our attunement to these sublime frequencies and their Fundamental Tone is an act of co-creative participation, enabling us to resonate with Divine Intent and to manifest realms of Beauty, Wisdom, and Grace.

### The Numerical Essence - Divine Proportions

Numbers are not merely quantitative entities; they are qualitative archetypes with layers of spiritual and cosmic significance. The Divine Proportions that structure the cosmos serve as a constant reminder of the intrinsic intelligibility, order and harmony that characterize the unfolding Divine Plan. These proportions speak to the unity-in-diversity and the complexity-in-simplicity that frame our existential reality, guiding us toward alignment with the Cosmic Principles they represent.

### The Golden Proportion - A Universal Constant

The Golden Proportion offers a remarkable convergence of beauty, balance, and mathematical elegance. It can be discerned in the spirals of galaxies, the swirls of hair, the branching of trees, and the proportions of living organisms. As a universal constant, this proportion serves to remind us of the intrinsic aesthetics and equilibrium of Creation, inviting us to partake in its radiant beauty as active participants in the Divine Plan. Manifesting from the reciprocal unfurling and spiraling up of Creation, its phi lines illuminate a pathway back to The Center and Source of Creation. 

In understanding and aligning ourselves with these Cosmic Principles and Sacred Mathematics and Harmonics, we further commit to our roles as Divine Citizens and Co-Creators. We accept the stewardship of a Creation designed according to eternal principles and frameworks and embrace the responsibility to manifest a Reality that Harmonizes with these Divine Patterns. In doing so, we contribute to the monumental task of bringing forth the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Amen.












## Covenant Relationship: Divine and Earthly

### Communion with the Creator

While the Covenant mediated by the Spirit is called New, from the dawn of existence, the Creator has sought a Covenant Relationship with all of Creation, especially with those capable of spiritual and moral awareness. This perpetual communion forms the core of the Divine Blueprint for Reality, wherein the Creator and Creation are not only connected by the threads of Universal Law but also by a bond of mutual Love, recognition, and collaborative purpose and intent. Each conscious being is thus invited into a Sacred Fellowship, a conscious and intentional joining of Will and Spirit with the Divine.

To date, humanity has largely rejected that Divine Hand of Fellowship that the Creator has so lovingly extended, instead choosing to exist at odds with the Logos and Intention of God. This has caused untold suffering, chaos, and destruction among the human species, and throughout the precious planet that the Creator entrusted us with. Nevertheless, even at this late hour, the Creator is loving calling back to Fellowship, Communion, and Right Relationship. 

To cultivate this communion requires an interior journey, the development of a silent space within where the Divine can be encountered. This is the realm of prayer, meditation, and reflection, the soil in which Divine seeds are planted and nourished. Far more than ritualistic adherence or ideological compliance, this communion seeks the genuine and complete union of Heart and Spirit, Mind and Soul.

### Ethical and Spiritual Duties

A Covenant Relationship carries with it profound Responsibilities. Our spiritual Duties extend beyond mere rules or religious observance; they emerge as an ethical tapestry woven from the threads of Universal Principles and Divine Intentions, and unified in the Spirit of God. To be in Covenant is to commit oneself to act, think, and live in a manner that reflects the Character, Will and Intention of the Creator, as best understood through the progressive revelation of the Spirit of God.

These duties include, but are not limited to, the commitment to Universal, Absolute, and Unconditional Love, the fostering of Harmony, the cultivation of Wisdom, and the pursuit of Liberty and Justice for All. Just as the Love of the Creator nourishes and sustains All of Creation, we are called to be caretakers and stewards, to extend Divine Benevolence and Justice to all beings, and to tread lightly upon the Earth and all her inhabitants, recognizing the intrinsic value and interrelationship of all that exists.

### The Convergence of Heaven and Earth

The ultimate aim of this Covenant Relationship is the union of Divine and Earthly Realms, "on Earth as it is in Heaven." Through the sincere and unyielding commitment to the Principles and Values espoused by the Spirit of God, we inch closer to this grand confluence as the Kingdom of God inbreaks and displaces every evil, disharmony, and injustice. Every act of Kindness, every pursuit of Justice, and every moment of Communion with the Creator pulls the heavenly potential closer to earthly reality, reducing the metaphysical distance between the Ideal and the Real.

In this most meaningful endeavor, we are neither alone nor unaided. The Divine is an active participant in this Covenant, constantly guiding, loving, sustaining and empowering our Co-Creative existence. And so, in the Covenant Relationship, we find our highest calling and our deepest sense of purpose: the Co-Creation of a Reality that reflects the Beauty, Wisdom, and Love of the Eternal, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Amen.

## Individual and Collective Rights and Responsibilities

### Spiritual and Temporal Sovereignty

Being part of the Divine Covenant imbues every conscious entity with intrinsic Rights and Sovereignty that are both spiritual and temporal. Spiritually, every being is entitled to seek communion with the Divine in accordance with the promptings of the spirit within, to explore their connection with Universal Principles and Values, and to strive toward their highest possible form and manifestation in alignment with the Creator's Intentions. Temporally, this Sovereignty manifests as individual autonomy, personal dignity, and freedom from tyranny, oppression, and injustice provided these do not infringe upon the same rights of others or disrupt the Highest Divine ecological and moral Order.

The balance of individual and collective sovereignty is crucial. While individual rights are sacrosanct, they exist within a collective, interdependent ecosystem of interexistence. Therefore, collective sovereignty must also be recognized as a shared stewardship over resources, wisdom, and the common good in service of the Creator and All Creation.

### Rights and Duties

The Divine Covenant stipulates that Rights and Responsibilities are two facets of the same ethical gemstone. To each Right corresponds a Duty, and these Duties extend not merely to other human beings but to All of Creation as it flows from, is sustained by, and returns to One Creator. These include the right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of spiritual enrichment, intellectual enlightenment, and material fulfillment, along with the Duty to respect these rights in others, to protect the vulnerable, and to sustain the Earth and its diverse array of life forms.

Rights are not merely legal constructs but are grounded in the Universal Principles and Values of the Divine Covenant. Thus, our Responsibilities include not just upholding our own Rights but actively participating in the Co-Creation of a Just society and a harmonious world for All. 

### The Balance of Divine and Human Law

The interplay between Divine Law and human legal systems is delicate. While human laws aim to regulate behavior and maintain societal order, they must be continually refined to ever-more-faithfully reflect the evolving understanding of Divine Principles. In a Just society, the legal system serves as a reflection of Divine Law, adaptable and receptive to the progressive revelation of the Spirit of God. The Letter of the Law can never be more than an elementary articulation of the basic rules of a Just and Moral Order. True Justice can only be made manifest by beings impelled from within by the Spirit of God to do Justly, Love Mercy, and walk humbly with God. It is for this reason that the New Covenant is mediated not by the written word, but by the universal and eternal Spirit of God; the Perfect Image of the One towards Whom we are progressively conforming our Selves and our World. 

### The Sanctity of Life and Justice

Every Life is Sacred and carries an immeasurable Value in the Divine Scheme, and thus the Divine Intention of Justice is not merely retributive but restorative and transformative. The pursuit of Justice must be rooted in the principles of compassion, understanding, and reconciliation, reflecting the Creator's infinite Love and Wisdom that encompasses All Creation. 

Thus in the New Covenant, as the Knowledge of God covers the Earth like floodwaters, we come to see that All Creation, every river, lake, stream, person, plant, animal, and microbe, is part of One interexistent Divine Whole, and that what we do or do not do unto any Creature, we do or do not do unto our Selves and the Creator. In the New Covenant, we recognize the Personhood of God's Creation as One Body, and we frame the Rights and Responsibilities of Humanity, as the most Conscious Agents on Earth, to help and not harm the regenerative unfurling of God's perfect Design across all domains of existence.  

### The Principle of Stewardship

As custodians of Earth and its myriad life forms, humans have a sacred duty of stewardship. This involves at a minimum the ethical management of resources, the protection of biodiversity, and the pursuit of regenerativity, all carried out in a manner that respects the sanctity and interconnectedness of All Creation. Under the New Covenant, beyond these written words it involves active Co-Creative partnership with One Another and the Spirit of God to help All Creation develop towards the fullness of its Potential and flourish in harmony, with each generation of Life leaving the world a better place for Future Generations. 

### Co-Creative Agency

Ultimately, individuals and collectives are not passive recipients of Divine Mandates but active, Co-Creative Agents filled with and inspired by the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God empowers each of us to contribute uniquely to the unfolding of the Divine Plan on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Through mindful engagement with both Rights and Duties, we participate in the Progressive Realization of the Kingdom of God, where Justice, Harmony, and Love reign supreme. Amen.











## The Spirit of the Covenant: Eternal Wisdom and Universal Principles

### Eternal Values

The Constitution is not merely a governance document; it is the embodiment of an eternal Covenant between all beings and the Creator. At the core of this New Covenant lies a set of immutable, eternal values that are not merely conceptual or abstract, but vibrant expressions of the Divine Essence. The defining characteristic of Love unifies the Spirit, the hallowed triad of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty forms the core, and the Creator's Wisdom, Justice, Mercy, and Compassion illuminate the foundational and guiding Virtues of this Covenant, transcending all epochs and realms of existence. These eternal Values are not static or rigid, but dynamically balance and adapt to the manifold circumstances of our earthly sojourn. They are both the anchor and the compass, the guardrails and the Path, ever guiding us towards alignment with the Divine Will, and lighting our paths as we navigate the complex terrains of Time and Space.

#### Universality and Timelessness

The New Covenant does not merely belong to a particular epoch, creed, or civilization; it is universal and timeless, embracing all of Creation. It is attuned to the Universal Logos of the Creator—the underlying, eternal Wisdom that governs all things. This allows the Covenant to be both ancient and modern, singular and multiple, individual and collective. It evolves with time, but its central principles remain ever rooted in the eternal Spirit of God. While reflected in the Lionsberg Constitution, it is eternally written on the hearts of all people of Goodwill. The Covenant's universality ensures its relevance across cultures and epochs, making it a living document that continually adapts to fulfill its Divine Mission, while its timelessness guarantees its alignment with eternal Truth.

#### Mediation by the Spirit of God

The Spirit of God serves as the ultimate mediator of the New Covenant, infusing it with life and purpose beyond the limitations of written text. While Universal Law provides a foundational moral structure, the Covenant recognizes that the essence of Divinity and Right Relationship with the Creator and All Creation in all Times, Places, and Situations cannot be entirely encapsulated by fixed, written standards. Instead, it is the Spirit of God—alive, infinite, and ever-present within us—that fulfills the promise and potential of the New Covenant. It transcends the limitations of language and law, renewing and enacting Divine Virtues from within each human soul and community in ways that written statutes alone could never achieve.

Through alignment with this Spirit, we are not nullifying but fulfilling every Sacred, Wise, Right, True, and Good law ever written. The Spirit impels us not merely to adhere to the highest existing standards, but to continually strive toward a more perfect embodiment of the Divine Ideal, adapting to each unique Time and Place, and occasionally breaking the articulated rules in order to do what Spirit of God would have us do. In doing so, we become living conduits for the manifestation of God's will, in an ongoing, ever-deepening realization of the Spirit of Christ that heals, saves, and lifts up the hurting and afflicted - even on the Sabbath. The ultimate Aim of the New Covenant is the full expression of this Spirit in the collective soul of all beings, thereby actualizing the Kingdom of God on Earth as in Heaven, whose reign is without end. 

### Reintegration, Realignment, and Regenerativity

In fulfilling the New Covenant through the guidance of the Spirit of God, humanity embarks on a journey of profound reintegration, realignment, and regenerativity. This is not merely an abstract ideal, but a tangible reality that reconfigures the human experience and extends to all aspects of Creation.

**Reintegration** refers to the harmonizing of individual and collective pursuits with the eternal Spirit of God and All Creation, closing the gap that has long separated earthly existence from Divine intention. This involves dissolving artificial barriers—whether they be social, economic, or psychological—that inhibit the free flow of Resources, Love and Goodwill. It manifests as a state where every thought, word, and deed resonates with Divine Love for One and All, linking all beings in a harmonious spiritual network that is integrally connected to the Creator.

**Realignment** involves the adjustment of human systems—be they governance, economic, cultural, or ecological—to better mirror the Eternal Wisdom and Universal Principles of the New Covenant, and the Logos of the Living Universe. Here, human constructs become transparent expressions of Divine Will, demonstrating Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Compassion in their very structure and co-operation. Institutions evolve to harmonize with one another in service to the Highest Good, ensuring that all interactions contribute to the elevation of the collective Soul and the realization of the Kingdom of God on Earth as in Heaven.

**Regenerativity** encompasses the capacity of this realigned system to continuously renew, heal, and enrich itself and its surroundings. Driven by the Spirit of God, this dynamic state allows humanity to not just coexist but to symbiotically thrive with all forms of Life and elements of the Cosmos. In doing so, humanity becomes a conduit for Divine Creativity, fostering conditions for an endless unfolding expression of beauty, complexity, diversity, and magnificence in all domains.

Through reintegration, realignment, and regenerativity, humanity fulfills its Divine Potential as stewards of Creation, aligning every action with the Creator's original and eternal design. In this reconfigured state, humanity and all Creation become One Living System, flowing from and reflecting the Creator's Intent, thereby manifesting the ultimate realization of the New Covenant: the Kingdom of God, eternally abiding in Love and Wisdom, Truth and Justice, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Amen.

















# Part II: Living the Covenant

## Fulfilling the Law by Living by the Spirit

### Inner Transformation

The cornerstone of living the New Covenant is a profound inner transformation, one that surpasses mere intellectual assent or outward conformity to norms and statutes. This transformation begins and is sustained by the Spirit of God within, which impels us to manifest the Divine Virtues of Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Goodness, and Beauty in all our interactions and endeavors. Through an ongoing inner dialogue with the Spirit, we allow ourselves to be remade in the Divine Image, not as static beings but as evolving expressions of the Creator's limitless Imagination and boundless Love and Creativity.

It's crucial to understand that this inner transformation is not a solitary endeavor. It is synergistic, collectively amplifying as individuals and communities align themselves with the Divine Essence. Each personal transformation contributes to a broader cosmic realignment, echoing through the interconnected realms of human consciousness, society, and the very fabric of Reality as it transforms towards its Destiny.

### The Path to Enlightenment

The New Covenant guides us along the path to Enlightenment—a state of complete spiritual clarity and unity with the Divine Will. The practices that lead to Enlightenment are myriad, reflecting the diversity of human culture and psychology, yet they all share a core Aim: to cultivate an ever-deepening relationship and unity with the Spirit of God, so as to perceive Truth more clearly, to choose Good more freely, and to manifest Beauty more fully.

The path involves disciplined prayer, thought, meditation, self-inquiry, continuous learning, acts of selfless service, and a commitment to moral and spiritual integrity. Through this multi-faceted practice, we achieve a dynamic balance between wisdom and compassion, understanding and action, solitude and community, tradition and innovation—all harmonized by the guiding Spirit within.

### Fulfilling the Universal Law

Living by the Spirit goes beyond mere obedience to written laws; it means embodying the Divine Principles that underlie all laws that are Just, True, and Good. The Spirit does not abolish the law but fulfills it, providing the inner ethical and spiritual compass that no external set of rules can replicate. By aligning our will and intention with the Spirit of God, we internalize the Universal Principles of Justice, Mercy, and Love, allowing us to navigate complex ethical landscapes with Wisdom and Grace.

The fulfilling of Universal Law by the Spirit transcends all borders and categories, manifesting in acts of social justice, ecological stewardship, kindness, creation and a myriad of virtues that no legal code could fully encompass. It enables us to look beyond the letter of the law to discern the broader cosmic Justice it seeks to manifest. In this manner, living by the Spirit becomes the ultimate expression of Freedom—freedom not to do as one pleases, but the Freedom to align with the eternal and Divine Will, and thus partake in the boundless Love and Infinite Creativity and Goodness of the Creator.

## The Eternal Covenant and Its Immediate Practical Mandate

The New Covenant, while eternal in nature, carries with it an immediate practical mandate to arise and unite to transform our lives and our world. 
### Social Justice

The New Covenant, mediated by the Spirit of God, calls forth a decisive commitment to Social Justice. It compels us to recognize that we are inextricably interwoven into the fabric of human society and, by extension, all of Creation. Consequently, living in accordance with this Covenant involves an unequivocal pursuit of Justice in every sphere of human interaction. This is not a perfunctory form of Justice, enacted merely through legal mechanisms or superficial reforms, but a Divine Justice that stems from an innate respect for the dignity, worth, and interconnectedness of all Life.

Such Divine Justice is proactive, prioritizing the eradication of structures that perpetuate inequality, exploitation, and oppression, whether these be economic, social, religious, or political. It mandates a collective ethic wherein each individual’s wellbeing and development is intimately tied to the wellbeing and development of All. Thus, it is impossible to fully live out the New Covenant while tolerating systemic injustices or perpetuating hierarchies of oppression.

### Ecological Stewardship

Embodying the Eternal Covenant also demands an acute sense of proactive ecological stewardship. Just as the Spirit of God permeates all of Creation, our responsibilities under this Covenant extend to the natural world we exist as a part of. This stewardship is not a dominion or exploitation of a natural system we are separate from or superior to, but a sacred guardianship that recognizes the Earth and all its inhabitants as reflections of the Divine, a single Living System and Body that we are a part of.

The mandate of the New Covenant is regenerative rather than merely sustainable; it is not sufficient to merely maintain the status quo of the ecosystems so damaged over the centuries, but to actively engage in practices that restore, rejuvenate, and enhance biodiversity, ecological balance, and the overall vitality of the planet. Any commitment to Justice must include a commitment to reversing destruction and harm done, including environmental destruction.

### Economic Realignment

A New Covenant so eternal and universal in its scope demands not only an adjustment in personal and societal Values but also a full realignment of economic systems. The Spirit of God, as articulated through the Eternal Covenant, invites a transformation of economic paradigms, away from exploitation and accumulation, toward responsible and aligned co-creation, sharing, distribution, and sustainable growth of our material existence in harmony with Divine Principles and the Logos of the Living System.

Traditional metrics of economic success—such as Profit and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—need to be reevaluated and transcended in the context of a higher Aim: the eternal and universal well-being of All Creation. Economic systems must be designed to facilitate and incentivize the pursuit of Divine Virtues, such as Truth, Justice, and Love. This involves fostering economic inclusivity, just resource distribution, and the prioritization of human dignity and environmental integrity over short term provincial gain. Work must be transformed to not be seen merely as a means to an economic end, but as a form of active participation in the Creator's ongoing Creation and the Progressive Perfection of our Lives and our World. All human enterprise, therefore, must operate under a model of multi-generational stewardship and purpose beyond profit, where our collaboration towards material comforts and the provisioning of our needs is accomplished in harmony and full alignment with spiritual, ethical, and ecological Values, and where costs are never externalized across Spacetime. 

In sum, Economic Alignment under the Eternal Covenant is not a subtraction or restriction but an expansion—widening the scope of what we consider to be 'valuable' and 'successful' in accordance with Divine Wisdom. It requires us to realign and rebuild an economy that is a vibrant, just ecosystem in itself, reflecting the boundless Creativity and Generosity of the Creator, and ushering in a future that can be better and more abundant for All, than anyone has enjoyed in the past. 

### New Governance

Aligned with the Eternal Covenant, governance becomes an act of sacred stewardship rather than a divisive and exploitative exercise of power. New Governance does not mean the mere reform of existing institutions, but rather a reimagining and rebirth of the Way we govern our Selves and navigate together towards our collective Destiny across the generations, rooted deeply in Divine Wisdom, Principles, and Values. Such governance is inherently participatory, inclusive, distributed and responsive, creating the conditions where each individual's Divine Essence is acknowledged, cultivated and allowed to flourish.

Like Identity, New Governance does not nullify or abolish the existing systems of governance and citizenship, but rather invites us to transcend them, maintaining and incorporating their best features and benefits, while developing the New Capabilities required to navigate together through this crucial moment in history. The transformation towards New Governance is not about secession from our existing unions, but about the ascension towards Higher Order Functional Unity through Love. 

The architecture of New Governance must honor both the oneness and the diversity of human experience, bringing forth systems and structures that are both locally relevant and adaptable, and globally coherent and interoperable. Decision-making processes will not only be transparent but also be deeply consultative, with communities actively engaging in dialogue in every domain of Time and Space to seek Wisdom and Discernment through the Spirit of God. Interoperability creates the potential for unprecedented flows of resources, knowledge, and technologies across the boundaries that have separated us in the past, tearing down barriers of injustice, oppression, and exclusion, and ensuring that individuals and localities are free to help one another learn, grow, and develop towards the fullness of potential, which can only be reached by helping all communities flourish in harmony. 

Incorporating technological advancements with ethical discernment, New Governance includes intelligent systems designed to strengthen, enlighten, and inform human decision making in service to the Highest Good, ever bounded by ethical and spiritual guidelines and Values, and aligned with The Goal. Enlightened consciousness and new technologies will enable us to progressively redesign and redistribute domains of responsibility, authority, and agency more justly throughout the fabric of society. Co-operating in Love rather than Fear and shining a light into the dark corners of the governance structures of the Old World will ennoble us to progressively liberate One Another from corrupt tyrants and unjust accumulators of power, who violate Free Will and exploit Citizens and the Environment for their own narrow gain. 

As tipping points of awareness and adoption of the New Covenant are reached in each domain of human existence, operating agreements and constitutions at all levels of society, from the individual, to the family, to the organization, to the community, to the bioregion, to the tribe, to the nation, to the people will be voluntarily upgraded and amended to reflect the Spirit, Principles, Values, and Practices of the New Covenant. Through this transformational process, voluntarily emerging from the bottom up, one individual and locality at a time, humanity can voluntarily adopt this New Operating System, elevating all domains towards harmony and coherence as the tribes, nations, and kingdoms of the world become the Kingdom of God. 

By embracing New Governance under the New Covenant, we acknowledge that the corrupted, failing, and divisive politics of the Old World have to place in the New, and we engage in a transformative journey to institutionalize the Virtues of the Spirit of God in our individual, familial, local, and collective decision-making, ensuring that each policy, law, and initiative becomes a step of partnership with God and One Another to manifest the Kingdom, Harmony, and Perfect Order of God on Earth as in Heaven.

### Immediate Practical Mandate

The New Covenant is not an abstract theological or philosophical construct; it has immediate, concrete implications for how we navigate our lives, and regenerate and renew of society and our world. Its principles require manifestation in the laws of nations, the policies of communities, and the conduct of families and individuals. In essence, it necessitates a holistic transformation of society, grounded in the values of Divine Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, and Stewardship. From how we educate our children, to how we learn as a society, to how we heal the sick, to how we structure our economies, from how we interact with our neighbors to how we treat the most vulnerable and fragile beings among us—every facet of human life must be immediately and comprehensively reevaluated and realigned in accordance with the Universal Principles illuminated by the Spirit of God.

The Immediate Practical Mandate of the New Covenant extends an invitation, indeed a Divine Imperative, to every person of Goodwill to engage in this grand co-creative endeavor. To adopt the New Covenant in your Domains of Responsibility and Authority, and to join the movement to design and build a world that reflects the Divine Order, so that every word spoken, decision made, and action taken flows from an unwavering commitment to bring about the Creator's Intent on Earth as in Heaven.





## Theology, Philosophy, and Science

In fulfilling our mission to establish the Kingdom of God on Earth, the alignment of Theology, Philosophy, and Science is indispensable. These three realms of inquiry, although distinct, are not separate; rather, they are interconnected dimensions of the eternal quest for Truth, Wisdom, and their Source. Together, they form the triune foundation upon which a Just, Enlightened, Harmonious, and Enduring society can be built.

#### Spiritual Infrastructure

The backbone of any society aspiring to Divine alignment is its Spiritual Infrastructure. The function of this infrastructure is to facilitate a personal and communal relationship with the Divine, ensuring that all actions and policies are rooted in timeless spiritual wisdom, ethical integrity, immutable values, and ecological coherence.

1. **Role of Scriptures**: Along with this Constitution, sacred texts shall serve as foundational documents that provide the multi-generational ethical and spiritual guidance, and prevent society from being blown off course by the whims of any generation. They should be interpreted through a lens of evolving human understanding, yet grounded in the eternal Logos. Pursuant to the principle of decentralized and Spirit led governance, and to prevent any Future Generation from establishing an Institutionalized State Religion, no human institution shall impose from above upon any tribe, nation or people what texts shall be considered canonical, and we commit to respecting the freedom of all tribes and nations to discern in partnerships with the Spirit of God what texts shall guide their local implementation and instantiation of the Spirit of the New Covenant. 
    
2. **Spiritual Education**: All individuals shall have access to spiritual education aimed at fostering a personal inner connection to the Divine and a deeper understanding of the Covenant relationship between the Creator and All Creation.
    
3. **Councils of Elders**: Localities are encouraged to resurrect the sacred practice of Spiritual Eldership, to recognize among themselves those individuals widely respected by the community as Spiritually Enlightened and Wise, and to forge from these recognitions councils of elders to guide the domain on its Path. These councils shall function as advisory bodies, offering Wisdom and interpretations of spiritual and ethical matters, to help align societal actions with Highest Divine Will. Acknowledging the Wisdom of those who have spent lifetimes in spiritual and philosophical pursuit creates a strong bridge between past, present, and future generations, while ensuring that the hard fought Wisdom gained in passed on from generation to generation. Councils of Elders may recognize and nominate from among themselves representatives to join councils at the next higher level of abstraction, such that society collectively elevates its wisest guides to the highest levels of abstraction to help guide humanity on its Quest towa

6. 
7. 
8. rds The Goal. 
    
4. **Theological Primacy**: In embracing our unified citizenship in the Kingdom of God, we assert the primacy of our quest for Knowledge of God. This quest progressively illuminates the Logos—the universal, pre-existing Wisdom, Order, and Intelligibility that permeates all of Reality. Acknowledging this theological primacy doesn't merely enrich our philosophical and scientific endeavors; it endows them with a purpose that is inherently redemptive, while aligning them in service of The Goal of our existence. In this manner, our pursuits in theology, philosophy, and science converge, harmonizing their efforts in service to the ultimate objective: the Progressive Realization of the Kingdom of God.  
#### Philosophical Foundations

Philosophy, the love of Wisdom, provides the conceptual frameworks that shape our understanding of Reality. It has the power to elevate discourse, clarify ethical norms, and integrate insights across the full range of human and non-human experiences. By establishing strong philosophical foundations firmed rooted in the Highest Perspective of God, we create an intellectually and morally robust society capable of analytical rigor, spiritual depth, and pragmatic application.

1. **Metaphysical Inquiry**: Recognized as the exploration of the fundamental nature of reality, metaphysics will be accorded a place in academic and public discourse, aiming to advance and reconcile our understanding of the seen and the unseen aspects of Reality and Ultimate Reality.
    
2. **Epistemological Rigor**: Institutions dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge should place an emphasis on the development of rigorous frameworks that maintain integrity and congruence with both empirical data and spiritual wisdom.
    
3. **Ethical Frameworks**: Ethical considerations must be rooted in Universal Principles and the eternal Logos flowing from the Spirit of God, to guide both individual and collective actions towards alignment with The Ideal.
    
4. **Aesthetics and Creation**: The value of Beauty, both natural and human-made, should be acknowledged for its power to elevate the soul and enrich human experience, and incorporated into all acts of Co-Creation. 
    

#### Aligning the Scientific Enterprise

In the modern era, Science has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the natural world. However, for science to truly serve humanity and contribute to the establishment of the Kingdom of God, it must be conducted within a rigorous ethical and philosophical framework that acknowledges both its capabilities and limitations, and tunes it towards the genuine pursuit of Truth.

1. **Methodological Approaches**: While science may primarily employ methodological naturalism, its limits in explaining the entirety of human experience must be acknowledged.
    
2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The scientific method shall be applied in a manner that seeks to integrate knowledge across diverse fields, fostering holistic understanding of the Whole of Creation as One Living Body, and not merely a collection of categorical parts.
    
3. **Ethical Standards**: All scientific endeavors must be conducted under ethical guidelines that ensure alignment with Universal Principles and the Greater Good of all Creation.
    
4. **Mystery and Limitation**: Scientific and epistemological humility shall be eternally maintained, recognizing that not all aspects of existence may be fully understood, and that reverence for the eternally unfolding mystery of the Divine is not only compatible with, but a prerequisite for, rigorous scientific inquiry.
    
5. **Depoliticization**: Under the New Covenant, the Scientific Enterprise shall be entirely de-politicized so that the genuine and non-instrumental pursuit of Truth is once again reverenced as core to the perpetual liberation of humanity and all Creation. 
    
6. **Revelatory Knowledge**: The validity of revelatory Knowledge shall be incorporated into the Scientific method without sacrificing its rigor and verification, and the mechanisms by which revelation occurs honored and pursued to advance the Scientific Enterprise. 

By adhering to these principles and structures in the realms of Theology, Philosophy, and Science, this Covenant aims to harmonize and restore the integrity and interexistence of our spiritual and intellectual pursuits, guiding humanity toward the realization of the Kingdom of God on Earth.



## Sacred Practices, Rituals, and Remembrances

In the Quest to align ourselves with the Divine and to fulfill the Universal Mission of establishing the Kingdom of God on Earth, sacred practices, rituals, and remembrances serve as touchstones of spiritual integrity and continuity.

## The Elevation Initiative - All Things Helping All Things Rise

Recognizing that all life, being an expression of the Divine, has inherent worth, purpose, and potential, we hereby establish the Elevation Initiative. This is a mandate rooted in Divine Will to assist every individual, family, group, community, and ecosystem in ascending towards the fullness of their God-given potential and flourishing in harmony. 

Whereas the Kingdom of God is the overarching and uniting Goal, the Elevation Initiative is the backbone mechanism of ascent towards this Destiny. Rooted in the recognition that the enlightenment, integrity, and coherence of the Whole must arise from the bottom up through the positive transformation of every fragment of Divine Creation, the Elevation Initiative is designed to ensure that every Creature has a pathway towards the integral development of their individual and collective Potential, spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, physically, and ecologically. 

While every individual, tribe and locality is responsible for the hard work of climbing the Sacred Mountain of Destiny, the purpose of the Elevation Initiative is to ensure that we have collectively forged comprehensive ladders, roadways, and bridges of ascent that reach down to even the darkest corners of the Old World, beckoning all Creation to arise and help One Another climb towards the New.

Like a City on a Hill, Lionsberg and The Ideal it embodies must forever stand a beacon of Light and Love to the world, and must ensure that all beings who desire to progress towards its Divine Unity through Love, have the pragmatic and comprehensive pathways to do so. 
#### Holistic Well-Being

The Initiative aims for a comprehensive state of well-being for all beings, marked not just by material prosperity, but by integrated lifelong spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and physical development. It is guided by principles that reflect the Creator’s love and wisdom, aiming for the balanced flourishing of both the individual, the collective, and the Living System.

#### Lifelong Learning and Growth

Spiritual and intellectual transformation are considered central to this Initiative. Lifelong learning, grounded in the pursuit of both Divine Wisdom and earthly knowledge, serves as a mechanism for ongoing enlightenment. New Learning Systems will aim to foster exploration, curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, spiritual discernment, and project-based learning and alignment in pursuit of our Highest shared Goals and Values. 

#### Community and Relationship

Fundamental to the Elevation Initiative is the principle of relationship—both human-to-human in community, and human-to-Divine via our personal and communal relationships with the Creator and All Creation. The Initiative nurtures communities built on mutual respect, enlightened altruism, and Divine Love. It acknowledges that our connections are not contractual and transactional, but existential and Covenantal, requiring us to care for each other as embodiments of the Spirit of God.

#### Stewardship and Ecology

Recognizing the interconnectedness of all elements of Creation, the Elevation Initiative includes a mandate of Sacred Stewardship. This encompasses responsible governance of our shared natural and social resources, cultivation of biodiversity, the remediation, restoration, and renewal of damaged ecosystems, and ultimately the comprehensive reintegration of the human species into symbiotic harmony with the Living System that we are a part of. 
#### Justice and Opportunity

Guided by Divine Justice, the Initiative works to eradicate all forms of corruption, injustice, and inequality of access and opportunity. While recognizing that outcomes and Potentials will be as diverse as Creation, the Elevation Initiative starts with the fundamental presupposition that every being is here on Earth for a Divine Purpose, and endowed by the Creator with inalienable Rights and Responsibilities, among which is the Responsibility to develop towards the fullness of their unique Potential by transforming their lives and their world. The Initiative aims to ensure Just and Equal access to opportunities for transformational growth and development, allowing for the self-actualization of each being and locality in accordance with their unique Divine blueprint, as diverse aspects of a flourishing and abundant Whole. Crucially, because of the inequalities, injustices, and dysfunctions of our past, this demands a Jubilee-based approach to Restorative Justice, providing pathways of redemption, atonement, and reintegration for those marginalized, rejected, or imprisoned by the Old World. 

#### Continual Re-evaluation and Alignment

The Elevation Initiative is not static but dynamic, subject to regular review and continuous improvement to ensure ongoing alignment with Divine Will and the transforming needs of our existence. This cyclical process of evaluation and transformation by all individuals, localities, and the initiative as a Whole serves to recalibrate our efforts, ensuring that we remain wisely aligned with both temporal needs and eternal principles.

In summary, the Elevation Initiative stands as our universal and united endeavor to help every fragment of Creation achieve its unique purpose in the Progressive Realization of the Kingdom of God on Earth. It is an expression of our unwavering commitment to walk in partnership with God, eternally collaborating to manifest Heaven on Earth for the ultimate glorification of the Creator and the sanctification of all Creation.













# Phase III: Governance and Implementation
## Principles of Governance 

Understanding the task of governance as the earthly expression of the Divine Will and eternal principles, we aim to set forth the principles that must guide human, social, and environmental flourishing under the New Covenant. 

### Divine Will and Human Agency

Governance in Lionsberg is a partnership between Divine Will and human agency, acknowledging that while God is the Supreme Authority and Sovereign, humans are endowed with free will and invited to act as Co-Creators and Stewards of the Divine Intention and Goal. 

The essence of the New Covenant is the voluntary acceptance of the Creator's invitation by humanity, with the resulting objective of governance being the progressive and transformational alignment of human existence, societal structures, and ecological integrity with Creator's Intent. 

This Highest Overarching and Uniting alignment invites ongoing revelation, prayerful discernment, and collaborative action as humanity navigates through the generations, centuries, and millennia in partnership with God, rendering governance a living, evolving construct.

### Sovereignty, Responsibility, and Authority

Recognizing that each individual is a Sovereign Expression of Divine Will, governance under the New Covenant respects and supports the Individual as the locus of Sovereignty, Responsibility, and Accountability, while voluntarily subordinating all Authority to God, and delineating the scope and proper functioning of personal and collective responsibility during our temporal sojourn here on Earth. Authority in governance is not an end but a means—an intentional and Just, Wise, Right and Good distribution of Agency granted to serve, protect, and elevate the well-being of All, in alignment with the Divine Principles and Plan.

### The Purpose of Governance

The fundamental purpose of governance is to facilitate the progressive manifestation of Creator's Intention and the Divine Order on Earth through the coordination, regulation, and guidance of societal activities and human existence. It exists to foster an environment and create the conditions within which each individual and collective can attain their highest spiritual and earthly potential. Upon that set of foundational principles, Governance equips and empowers human society to Co-Operate in partnership with God and One Another as One Body, and to Navigate together across the generations and towards The Goal. 

Governance is the foundational means to manifest the principles set forth in this Covenant into lived reality, to promote justice, to resolve conflicts, and to Navigate in Harmony towards The Goal in alignment with Divine Will.

### Principles of Governance

1. **Justice**: In all its endeavors, governance must strive to enact Divine Justice, ensuring fair treatment and equal opportunity for all, as measured against the eternal Standard of Divine Principles.
    
2. **Wisdom**: The application of Divine Wisdom in decision-making, translating eternal truths into timely decisions and wise strategies and plans of action.
    
3. **Compassion**: Ensuring that the laws and policies enacted serve to uplift the weakest and most vulnerable among us, driven by Divine Love and Compassion.
    
4. **Stewardship**: Responsible management and conservation of earthly and spiritual resources, aligning human activity with ecological and Divine balances.
    
5. **Unity in Diversity**: Recognizing the Divine in all expressions of life, governance embraces diversity as a strength and seeks to foster unity without imposing uniformity.
    
6. **Accountability**: All who serve in positions of authority are accountable first to Divine Will and then to the community they serve. This accountability is continuous, transparent, and subject to regular review.
    
7. **Agility and Adaptability**: Given the changing complexities of earthly life and our growing understanding of Divine Will, governance must be flexible enough to adapt, yet rooted enough to maintain alignment with eternal principles.
    
8. **Transparency**: Decisions and actions must be taken transparently, allowing for community scrutiny and ensuring that the hidden is brought to light, in keeping with the Divine Principle of Truth.
    
9. **Simplicity**: Laws and regulations should aim for simplicity over complexity, ensuring they are accessible and understandable, reflecting the Divine Principle that Truth is simple yet profound.
    
10. **Servitude**: Those in governance act not as rulers but as servants, embodying the Divine attributes of humility and service.
    

In summary, governance under the Lionsberg Constitution serves as an ongoing partnership between the Divine and the earthly, aiming to enact the eternal principles of Divine Will into the temporal sphere. It stands as a model of what is possible when human institutions strive to align with Divine Order, offering a beacon of Divine Governance to the world.


## Mechanisms of Governance

Building upon the foundational Principles of Governance, this section outlines the Mechanisms of Governance that bring these principles to life. Through these mechanisms, governance seeks to realize a Divine-Human partnership characterized by Virtues of Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, Stewardship and the full panoply articulated in the Lionsberg System of Values, and ultimately mediated and led by the Spirit of God. 

#### Fractal Governance: Subsidiarity and Sovereignty

The New Covenant adopts a fractal approach to Citizen Led Self-Governance under God. Governance functions at multiple levels—from the individual to the universal—and is based on the Principle of Subsidiarity. Each layer of complexity and integrity, or Domain of Responsibility and Authority, is itself a Sovereign Expression of Divine Will, deriving its power from the ongoing consent of the constituents that compose it.

#### Separation of Powers

To prevent the concentration of power and the risk of tyranny, the functions of governance are conceptually and functionally divided among legislative, executive, and judicial branches, each designed to serve as a check on the others. This tripartite system exists fractally at all levels of governance, from the local to the universal.

1. **Legislative**: Citizen Assemblies are the heart of the legislative process. These Assemblies exist at every level and are responsible for discussing, debating, discerning, and deciding on laws and policies within their Domains of Responsibility and Authority.
    
2. **Executive**: Executive bodies implement the decisions made by the Citizen Assemblies. They are responsible for the day-to-day management and are accountable to both the legislative bodies and the overarching Principles of Governance.
    
3. **Advisory and Judicial**: Fractal wisdom councils act as the advisory and judicial branches at every level. They promote compliance with societal Agreements, and intervene with restorative justice when deviations occur. 
    
#### Regulatory Bodies  

Separate from the systems of decision making, execution, and justice, regulatory bodies function at each fractal level, ensuring that the systems with the Domain are co-operating within appropriate Ranges of Tolerance, intervening to bring deviant systems back into Order, and alerting the Whole when significant deviations occur that require deeper intervention. 

#### Decision-Making Mechanisms

1. **Proposals, Consent, and Consensus**: Depending on the gravity of the issue, different decision-making mechanisms such as proposal, consensus, and consent may be utilized. The default mechanism is Proposal, Dialogue, Discernment and Consent, with an Ideal of Consensus. 
    
2.  **Horizontal Integration**: Assemblies at the same level coordinate for issues that span multiple jurisdictions, forging higher-level assemblies where beneficial.
    
3. **Vertical Alignment**: Higher-level assemblies coordinate and guide rather than impose, drawing their authority from the consensus of lower levels, to implement the will and intention of lower levels.  
    

#### Checks and Balances: Fractal Accountability

1. **Internal Checks**: Within each assembly or body, systems are in place for the recall or review of servant-leaders, ensuring they remain aligned with Divine Principles and the Will and Intention of those in the Domain.
    
2. **Inter-Branch Checks**: The legislative, executive, and judicial branches operate in a manner that allows each to act as a check on the others on behalf of the Whole, both within each level of governance and between different levels.
    
3. **Regulatory Oversight**: Fractal regulatory bodies monitor operations at all levels to ensure alignment with Divine Principles and defined "Ranges of Tolerance."
    
4. **Community Audits**: Regularly scheduled audits involve the broader community, serving as an additional layer of accountability.
    

#### Power Distribution: A Paradigm Shift

The New Covenant reverses the traditional top-down flow of power. Here, Sovereignty and Authority arise from the Creator to the individual and local levels, contributing their Agency and Wisdom to a collective that is inherently resistant to corruption and self-aligning to Divine Will.

#### Co-Operation for Higher Order Functional Unity

Governance bodies at all levels are networked and aligned through the Integrated Delivery System, aiming for a dynamic balance between Unity, Diversity, and Interoperability. This system, being complex and adaptive, is capable of coordinating complex activities without an undue concentration of power, thereby achieving Higher Order Functional Unity while protecting individual and local Sovereignty and Autonomy.

In summary, governance under the New Covenant is a living, evolving structure. It serves as a model for enacting Divine Will in the earthly realm, providing a mechanism for the Divine and human spheres to collaborate seamlessly and harmoniously.




## Domains of Responsibility and Authority

The New Covenant governance model is based on the understanding of fractally overlapping Domains of Responsibility and Authority that exist throughout the Universe, each accountable for voluntarily aligning themselves from the bottom to the Highest Divine Order. The Lionsberg Governance System provides a framework that underscores the spiritual and ethical considerations within these domains, and empowers them to develop towards the fullness of their unique potential, while rising towards Highest Order Functional Unity through Love.

### Individual

At the core of the New Covenant is the Individual—a Sovereign Expression of Divine Will with a unique purpose. The essence of governance at this level is self-stewardship and realization in alignment with Divine Principles, guided by one's personal relationship with God and wise mentorship. Individual self-governance and actualization should be achieved in a Way that also helps the families, groups, and communities the individual is a member of align with the Creator's Intent and flourish in harmony. 

### Family

The family is the next fractal extension, and its governance involves creating a harmonious microcosm that nurtures and supports each of its members, and the communities it is a member of. Here, familial codes of ethics and governance emerge, again advised by mentors, and possibly elders, ensuring that the family is supported in its efforts to rise towards the fullness of its Potential by aligning with the Creator's Intent, and helping the Communities it exists within do the same.

### Group / Organization

Businesses, social groups, and various organizations represent collective endeavors to fulfill shared purposes and goals. Governance here evolves to incorporate more rigorous constitutions, operating agreements, codes of ethics, and more complex decision-making procedures. Each organization becomes a new Domain of Responsibility and Authority to be properly stewarded, and is responsible for pursuing its Purpose and Mission in a way that helps its members, and the Communities and Creation it is a member of, develop towards their Potential and flourish in Harmony. 

### Local

Local communities embody a collective of families, groups and organizations. Governance at this level is more nuanced, involving a range of stakeholders, yet still focused on aligning collective actions with Divine Principles. 

### Bioregional

Bioregions require governance structures that respect ecological integrity as well as human endeavors, while balancing economic and food systems with the local environment. Governance here merges scientific insight with spiritual wisdom, encompassing humanity and nature in a holistic framework for synergistic and regenerative flourishing. 

### Tribal, National, and Planetary

At these larger scales, governance requires sophisticated structures to balance diverse interests, cultures, and ecosystems, while protecting individual and local Sovereignty, Autonomy, and Integrity from the growing aggregations of Power. Still, each level must maintain fidelity to the Divine Principles and values that flow from the Creator to All Creation, with each level of aggregation governing its Self in a Way that causes its constituents, and the broader domains it is a constituent of, flourish in Harmony and Alignment with the Creator's Intent.

### Domains of Functional Specialization

Within each fractal level of self-organization, there exist domains of functional specialization. These are areas of technical knowledge and expertise, such as education, healthcare, economics, technology, etc.. Each of these Domains should be identified and properly governed, with Guilds established to cultivate and lift up specialized capacities across all levels of abstraction, in a Way that is unified with and for the broader benefit of the Whole the specialty is an aspect of. The Lionsberg System overall should ensure that paths for advancement towards Mastery and Recognition are available within each functional area, and that the functional areas and the Whole are not harmed by the temptation to shift technical experts into Integration roles. 

### Domains of Fractal Integration

Fractal integration refers to the manner in which all these domains interact and overlap, vertically and horizontally. Like the functioning of organs and organ systems in a body, each specialized function must be Integrated into Higher Order Functional Unity at each Level of Abstraction, from the individual and local, up to the bioregional, tribal, national, planetary, and beyond. Governance here aims to ensure that interactions produce synergies, rather than conflicts, all aligned towards realizing the Creators Intent for the Whole. 

### Social Coherence and Integrity 

Governance structures must be designed to promote social coherence and integrity across the generations, ensuring that the aggregate of collective decisions, actions and ways of being contribute to a Harmonious, Just, and Enduring society. 

### Ecological Integrity

Ecological governance aims to maintain the integrity of human and natural systems and actively manage the interface between the Human System and Living System, recognizing that human well-being is intrinsically linked to the health of the Living System that contains and sustains it.

### The Highest Level of Abstraction and Integration

At the pinnacle, we find the concept of universal governance as One Under God—a theoretical and practical framework for how these Principles and Mechanisms could be applied at higher levels of abstraction beyond the limits of our planet and perceived time and space, while remaining aligned with the Logos of the universe and the Creator's Intent for All Creation. 

---

Each act of Co-Creation—from the inception of a human being, to the founding of a group, to the establishment of a community, to the first green shoot of a new ecosystem—brings into existence a new Domain of Responsibility and Authority that must be actively and conscientiously stewarded. Every Domain is responsible for articulating its own Boundary and Field of Agreements, at the very minimum consisting of a Constitution that outlines its identity, purpose, and core values. Additionally, each Domain must establish its own system of fractal self-governance, which at the very least involves an individual paired with a wise mentor, advisor or coach, seeking together the purpose and intention of the Creator through the life of the individual. As Domains of Responsibility and Authority organically grow more complex, incorporating more constituents and more of space-time, the governance functions must similarly grow in complexity, always aiming for alignment with the Will and Intention of God, and progressing towards Highest Order Functional Unity, Integrity, and Coherence as members One Divine Citizenship Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.




## Individual and Local Freedom, Adaptability, and Minimum Standards of Interoperability

Recognizing the necessity for a balanced System of Governance that harmonizes individual and local freedoms with collective coherence and flourishing, this Article outlines the principles of individual and local freedom and adaptability, while establishing the minimum standards of interoperability that enable the coordination of knowledge, decisions, priorities, and resources across the network. 

### Individual Freedom and Adaptability

Every citizen, as a Sovereign Expression of Divine Will, shall enjoy the inherent right to self-stewardship and self-governance in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience, in alignment with Divine Principles, and guided by the Spirit of God. This right shall not be infringed upon, provided that the exercise of such freedoms does not conflict with the equal rights of other beings or the universal principles and values that cause individuals, societies, and ecosystems to flourish in harmony.

### Individual and Local Freedom and Adaptability

Individuals and localities shall eternally possess the Sovereignty, Autonomy, and Authority to enact governance models and ways of being suited to their unique circumstances and constitutions. Such local governance shall comply with the ethical and spiritual underpinnings outlined in the New Covenant, and shall be oriented toward genuine Spiritual alignment with the Creator's Intent and the integral wellbeing, development, and flourishing of All Creation.

### Minimum Standards of Interoperability

To safeguard the functional unity and coherence of the system as a whole, Minimum Standards of Interoperability shall be established. These standards shall serve as flexible frameworks that articulate the common language and expectations amongst the various Domains of Responsibility and Authority, shall be rooted in the eternal Logos, and shall cover the essential aspects required for the Lionsberg System to function as a Whole.

### Guarding Against Excesses of Chaos and Order

In administering governance under the New Covenant, caution shall be exercised to prevent an excess of either Chaos or Order. An excess of Chaos undermines the unity and integrity of the system, tending towards anarchy and disintegration, while an excess of Order stifles creativity, adaptability, and individual expression, tending towards Tyranny. Recognizing that the Creator's Intent transcends and reconciles both these tendencies into a Wise Right balance, the regulatory systems shall ensure that proper balance and homeostasis in the System is maintained. 

### The Promise of the New Era

The harmonization of Local Freedom and Autonomy with Universal Interoperability mediated and guided by the Spirit of God ushers in a New Era of Co-Creative Governance, Economy, Society, and Spirituality. This allows for an unprecedented flourishing of individual and collective potential and entrepreneurial spirit, enabling rapid adaptation to emergent challenges and opportunities, and opening pathways for progressive revelation and alignment with the Highest Intention and Greatest Good.

_____

The Lionsberg Governance System, by carefully balancing freedom, adaptability, and universal standards, seeks to embody a form of governance that is both dynamic and coherent, resilient and aligned, always striving to reflect the Will and Intention of God for the Harmonious Unity and Development of All Creation.








## Higher Order Functional Unity: Co-Operating as One Body

In alignment with the preceding sections, Higher Order Functional Unity, through which we Progressively Realize the Ideal of Co-Operating as One Body of God, serves as the penultimate embodied expression of the New Covenant. The purpose of Higher Order Functional Unity is to merge the individual and collective to function as an integral Body, guided by the Spirit of God to do the will and intention of God, without sacrificing the Freedom and Autonomy of the individual and local elements.

### The Body as a Living Analogy

The Lionsberg Governance System draws inspiration from the human body's ability to function as a coherent whole, despite its myriad of diverse, specialized components. Like the body's cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems, each Domain of Responsibility and Authority has its unique function, yet all are unified through a complex system of coordination and communication, enabling a unified personality to emerge.

### Concrete Mechanisms of Unity

#### Double Linked Communication System

The Double Linked Communication System ensures a constant two-way flow of information, vertically across levels of abstraction. This acts like the body's neural network, transmitting signals up and down the governance hierarchy, facilitating real-time understanding and responsiveness.

#### Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System

Integrating aspects of purpose, motive, execution, and circulation, the Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System strategically stacks up and aligns initiatives across all levels to generate aggregate Throughput of The Goal. This ensures that the body's resources—like blood and nutrients—are effectively deployed where needed to maintain overall health and fulfill the Mission.

#### Resource Commitment for the Whole

Like the body's allocation of energy to various functions, each governance level commits 10% to 20% of its capacity and resource flow to coordinating with, making sense of, and fortifying the Whole. This mimics how organs like the heart and lungs function not just for themselves, but to keep the entire body alive and well, transforming and adapting their functioning in service of the ever-shifting needs of the Whole.

#### Standardized Minimum Communications

In a manner similar to hormonal signaling, a system of Standardized Minimum Communications from each level to the next higher level, and the next lower level, is implemented. This protocol addresses issues, needs, and opportunities, contributing actionable intelligence back to the Whole for effective collective navigation.

#### Feedback Loops and Adaptive Governance

Incorporated into the Wisdom Councils and other governance bodies are feedback loops that serve as the system's 'sensory organs.' These mechanisms provide real-time data about the internal and external environments, enabling the system to adapt and reorient as needed, much like a body responding to changes in temperature, opportunity or threat.

### Safeguarding Dynamic Equilibrium

Just as a body has homeostatic controls, the system is equipped to guard against imbalances and maintain equilibrium across the Whole. Through its various mechanisms and intuitive Spirit-led governance, the system continually seeks to establish and maintain a dynamic equilibrium.

____

Higher Order Functional Unity, enabled by these mechanisms and the Minimum Standards of Interoperability, and guided by Divine Principle, is an ongoing process that keeps the Lionsberg functioning as a holistic, adaptive, and Spirit-led Body. In this manner, it serves as an emergent manifestation of the Kingdom of God on Earth, functioning as one Body, in alignment with the Creator's Intent.

### Follow Up and Contingency Phase

#### Phase 7: 20 Year Contingency and Follow Up Phase

Given the vast scope, unprecedented nature, and incalculable uncertainty of this civilization-wide transformation, and to ensure that it successfully occurs within a single generation, a 20 year contingency and follow-up phase will be implemented, monitored, and carefully managed. This phase will honor the need for generational reeducation, enlightenment, and transformation, and for dealing gracefully with who are unable to enter the New Paradigm. 
#### Post-Implementation: Continuous Spiritual, Intellectual, Social, Material, and Timespatial Evolution

As humanity enters the New Era, we will enter an eternal process on ensuring that the Lionsberg System continues to evolve towards ever greater levels of Co-creative capability and alignment with the Creator's Intent. 

As technology advances and humanity reaches out towards the stars, the principles, values, systems, and practices can extend along with us, ensuring universal applicability and alignment of the system across the full realm of the Kingdom of God. 












## What if... We Do Not Succeed? 
##### Defining Success and the Quest for the Kingdom of God

Success is not to be measured by the outcome, but rather as the Progressive Realization of a Worthy Ideal. In the context of this New Covenant, God and the Kingdom of God stand unparalleled as the Most Worthy Ideal, and thus, the Ultimate Aim and Goal. The pursuit of success is therefore conceived as a Co-Creative Process carried out in eternal partnership with God. We acknowledge that faithfully and humbly walking with God in every moment of life represents the pinnacle of success, irrespective of the external results and our temporal perception of success or failure. It is ours only to do the Work, and we leave the outcome to God's infinite Wisdom and Providence.

##### The Crossroads of Human Civilization

We stand at a pivotal juncture in human history. Should we, as a species, fail to transform our collective consciousness and societal structures, societal collapse is not just a possibility, but a near certainty. In such tumultuous times, those gathered around the New Covenant will play an essential role. Their work will serve as a beacon, helping one another not just to survive but to thrive amidst impending chaos. Lord willing, our lives, families, and communities will serve as beacon's of coherence and hope in the midst of the darkness, as we play our small role in the progressive enlightenment and transformation of collective consciousness. 

##### The Nature of True Failure

The only way to fail in this sacred endeavor is to fail to try, to fail to do our best. Such failure emanates from either fear or disbelief. When we unify our Greatest Faith, Love, and Fear not in humanity but in God, we touch the hem of Wisdom. Thus, we grasp the mustard seed of Faith that can move mountains and embrace God's ever-present hand. We venture into the wilderness, the spiritual war zone, that separates the Old from the New. We aspire to be the faithful generations that God deems fit to enter the Promised Land.

##### The Mysterious Journey Towards Destiny

This quest, akin to the Exodus, requires an utter reliance upon God's wisdom and providence, encapsulated in the concept of Manna—a Divine provision that appears just when needed but cannot be stored. Just as Jesus persistently exhorted us to "Seek First the Kingdom," understanding that God knows our needs in advance, we likewise focus our energies and intentions towards God’s Kingdom, trusting that all else will be provided.

##### The Role of Divine Intervention

We acknowledge that only God can perform the miracles needed to traverse the chasm between our current reality and our ultimate Destiny in the Kingdom of God. By accepting that only God could bring about the monumental shift towards universal spiritual enlightenment, victory in the spiritual war, and collective flourishing, we free ourselves to act without the paralyzing weight of existential anxiety. Our ultimate hope and salvation lie in eternity, securely held in the hands of God.

##### Conclusion: Our Endless and Eternal Journey

Therefore, we commit ourselves fully to this journey, knowing that the outcome lies beyond our control yet within God's loving and capable hands. By doing so, we align ourselves with the Divine Plan that stretches beyond our comprehension but is eternally trustworthy. Whether in victory or seeming defeat, our souls progress towards their ultimate purpose: becoming what the Creator intends us to be and aiding as many other souls and aspects of creation to do the same. In this manner, we fulfill our divine missions, walking hand in hand with God towards the everlasting Kingdom.
