# LC 8. Covenant Relationship

Our [[Current Best Understanding]], heralded by a vast array of scripture and prophesy and supported by the logic and Logos of the universe, is that the Creator's Intent is for All Creation to arise and unite in an eternal and universal Covenant Relationship. 

The [[Creator's Intent]], the Highest unwritten Law, forms the basis of this New Covenant between [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Unlike the relational bonds of the past, which were mediated by draconian laws, bureaucracy, and enforcement, this New Covenant is one of spiritual enlightenment, understanding and functional unity flowing from the Higher knowledge, understanding, and fear of the One Who unites us All. 

This is now possible because the Knowledge of God is covering the Earth like floodwaters, enabling All Citizens of Earth to voluntarily *choose*, of their own Free Will, to rise into Right Relationship with One Another, the Creator, and All Creation. 

This Universal and Eternal New Covenant Relationship between the Creator and All Creation is the Highest Order Agreement, which supersedes and takes precedence over all previous agreements. 

This New Agreement unites and empowers all people of Goodwill to work together to transform and conform their lives and their world towards the overarching and uniting Wisdom, Intention, and Design of the Creator.
