# LC 24. The Lionsberg System of Justice

[[Lionsberg System of Justice]] 

## Context

On our [[Quest]] towards our [[Destiny]], we understand the necessity of a just, impartial, and effective system for resolving disputes, rectifying harms, and ensuring the fair application of our principles, values, laws, and policies.

## Purpose of the System of Justice

The Lionsberg System of Justice is designed to resolve disputes between parties, rectify harms done, and interpret and apply the laws and policies enacted by the [[Lionsberg Legislative System]] in a manner that is just, fair, and in alignment with our shared Principles and Values.

## Guiding Values

The System of Justice is guided by the Values of [[Justice]], [[Fairness]], [[Transparency]], [[Accountability]], [[Integrity]], [[Impartiality]], [[Wisdom]], [[Compassion]], and [[Respect]].

## Structure of the System of Justice

The Lionsberg System of Justice is organized in a fractal structure that mirrors and flows through the structure of the Lionsberg Citizen Assembly System.

Each Citizen Assembly has a Judicial Body, which is responsible for the resolution of disputes, rectification of harms, and interpretation and application of the laws and regulations enacted by the corresponding Legislative Body. Each Judicial Body is presided over by a **Elder** who is chosen by the corresponding Citizen Assembly.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The main roles and responsibilities of the Judicial Bodies include:

-   Resolving disputes between parties in a fair and impartial manner
-   Rectifying harms done and ensuring justice for victims of wrongdoing
-   Interpreting and applying the laws and policies enacted by the corresponding Legislative Body
-   Reviewing the actions of the Regulatory and Executive Bodies as required to ensure their fairness, legality, legitimacy, and consistency with our principles, values, laws and policies

## Judicial Leadership

The Judicial Leadership at each Level of Abstraction is chosen by the corresponding Citizen Assembly. The Judicial Leadership, led by an **Elder**, is responsible for leading the Judicial Body, coordinating its activities, and representing it in interactions with other bodies and with the Citizen Assembly.

## The Lionsberg Supreme Court

The Lionsberg Supreme Court is the pinnacle of the System of Justice. It is composed of 9 Justices, chosen from and by the General Assembly, to oversee the interpretation and application of principles, values, laws and regulations at the federal level and those affecting the Whole.

The Supreme Court operates under the leadership of a Lead Elder, elected by the Justices from amongst themselves. The Lead Elder is responsible for coordinating the judicial activities of the Court, and representing the Court in interactions with other bodies.

## Judicial Process

The judicial process in Lionsberg is designed to be transparent, fair, and effective. When a dispute arises or a harm is reported, the corresponding Judicial Body conducts a hearing or trial. Decisions are made based on evidence, law, and our shared Principles and Values, and are subject to appeal to higher Judicial Bodies, culminating in the Supreme Court.

## Accountability and Transparency

The Judicial Bodies, including the Supreme Court, are accountable to the Citizen Assemblies and to the citizens of Lionsberg. They are obligated to conduct their work with transparency, ensuring that their decisions and the reasons for them are accessible to all citizens.

## Checks and Balances

The System of Justice is subject to checks and balances from the Legislative System and the Executive System. The Legislative System reviews the effectiveness of the laws and policies applied by the System of Justice, while the Executive System ensures that the decisions of the System of Justice are properly carried out.

## Continuity of Governance

In the event of unforeseen circumstances that disrupt the normal functioning of the System of Justice, interim measures may be established by the Lionsberg General Assembly to ensure continuity of governance. These measures must respect the spirit of this constitution and be discontinued as soon as it is Wise and Right for normal operations to resume.

By establishing the Justice System in this way, we, the people of Lionsberg, affirm our commitment to effective and accountable governance, and our belief in the power of wisdom, discernment, accountability, and reconciliation to create a just, loving, and good society.
