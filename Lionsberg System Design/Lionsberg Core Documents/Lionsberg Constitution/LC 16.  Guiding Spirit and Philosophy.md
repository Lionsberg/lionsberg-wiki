# LC 16.  Guiding Spirit and Philosophy

The Guiding Spirit of Lionsberg is [[One]] with the Spirit that creates and sustains the universe. 

From this One Spirit of the Creator flows All life, consciousness, and every other Value and Good. 

This Spirit gives rise to a unified and coherent philosophy rooted in Truth and Love of the Logos, the Universe and its Generative Source. 

This Guiding Spirit and the Philosophy impel us to progressively realize and embody the Absolute and Unconditional Love of the Creator for All Creation, desiring for All Life and Consciousness to develop towards the fullness of its Potential and Flourish in Harmony. 

From this Spirit we understand both the inherent worth, dignity, and sovereignty of every individual and locality, as well as the reality that our collective future depends on our ability to understand and embody our interexistence and inherent unity, and work together in partnership with God and One Another towards the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for [[All]].
