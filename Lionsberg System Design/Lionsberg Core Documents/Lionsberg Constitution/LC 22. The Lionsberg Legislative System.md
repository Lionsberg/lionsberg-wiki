# LC 22. The Lionsberg Legislative System

[[Lionsberg Legislative Branch]] 

## Context

On our [[Quest]] towards our [[Destiny]], we affirm the importance of a legislative system and framework that empowers the collective wisdom and discernment of our Citizen Assemblies to shape the processes, laws and policies guiding us on our path.

## Purpose of the Legislative System

The Lionsberg Legislative System is created to create, amend, and repeal decisions, laws and policies reflecting the decision making of the Citizen Assemblies, ensuring these laws and policies are justly crafted and efficiently enacted at every level.

## Guiding Values

The Legislative System is guided by the Values of [[Transparency]], [[Accountability]], [[Responsibility]], [[Participation]], [[Truth]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Discernment]].

## Structure of the Legislative System

The Lionsberg Legislative System is integral to the structure of the Lionsberg Citizen Assembly System.

Each Citizen Assembly, in its diversity of scopes, serves as the foundational legislative body at its respective level, locally making and enacting the decisions, laws and policies that affect its Domain.

This legislative function culminates in the Lionsberg General Assembly, composed of 144 Representatives selected from and by the Citizen Assemblies, that legislates on matters of international importance and those affecting the Whole.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The main roles and responsibilities of the Legislative Bodies include:

-   Crafting, reviewing, amending, and repealing decisions, laws and policies in alignment with the collective decision of the corresponding Citizen Assembly
-   Ensuring the laws and policies are reflective of the guiding values, and aligned with the goals and objectives of the [[Lionsberg System Wide Master Plan]]
-   Providing oversight of the Executive Bodies to ensure that the enacted decisions, laws and policies are effectively implemented
-   Evaluating the impact of existing laws and policies and revising them as needed for the benefit of the whole community

## The Lionsberg General Assembly

The Lionsberg General Assembly is the pinnacle of the Legislative System, working on legislation that affects the federation as a Whole. The General Assembly is composed of 144 Representatives, chosen from and by the Citizen Assemblies.

These Representatives should embody the Values of Lionsberg, demonstrate deep understanding of the System Wide Master Plan, and possess the wisdom to legislate for the Highest Intention and Greatest Good of All.

The General Assembly operates under the leadership of a Facilitator, selected by the Representatives from amongst themselves on the basis of Proposal and Consent. The Facilitator is responsible for coordinating the legislative activities of the General Assembly, and representing the Assembly in interactions with the Executive and Judicial Systems.

## Legislative Process

The legislative process in Lionsberg is designed to be inclusive, participatory, and deliberative. It begins at the level of the Citizen Assemblies, where proposals for laws and policy changes are developed and refined. These proposals can be escalated to higher levels of abstraction, culminating in the General Assembly, based on their scope and significance.

At each level, the proposals are openly debated and modified as necessary, with the aim of achieving consensus or, where needed, a minimum standard of consent around the proposal.

Citizen Assemblies have the right and responsibility to make decisions, policies and laws to properly govern their [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]], as well as to make proposals to Higher Order Assemblies. Decisions, Laws, and Policies can be made at any level of abstraction where Consent around a Proposal can be achieved, provided that such a decision does not infringe on the rights and responsibilities of other Citizens in their respective [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]]. 

Once a law or policy is enacted, it is passed to the corresponding Executive Body for implementation. 

## Accountability and Transparency

The Legislative Bodies, including the Lionsberg General Assembly, are accountable to the Citizen Assemblies and to all citizens of Lionsberg. They are obligated to conduct their work with transparency, ensuring that their decisions and the reasons for them are accessible to all citizens.

## Checks and Balances

The Legislative System is subject to checks and balances from the Executive System and the Judicial System. The Executive System ensures that the laws and policies enacted by the Legislative System are properly implemented, while the Judicial System reviews and rules on their constitutionality and alignment with our Values. 

As an additional check and balance, the Executive System must consent to implement decisions made by the Legislative System. In the event that the Executive Body believes a decision would compromise the ability of the Assembly to progress towards its Goals and Objectives, the Executive Body may raise a [[Meaningful Objection]] and require that the proposal be improved by the Legislative System prior to implementation.

## Continuity of Governance 

In the event of unforeseen circumstances that disrupt the normal functioning of the Legislative System, interim measures may be established by the Lionsberg General Assembly to ensure continuity of governance. These measures must respect the spirit of this constitution and be discontinued as soon as it is Wise and Right for normal operations to resume.

By establishing the Legislative System in this way, we, the people of Lionsberg, affirm our commitment to effective and accountable governance, and our belief in the power of collective wisdom, discernment, and decision making to create a just, loving, and good society.
