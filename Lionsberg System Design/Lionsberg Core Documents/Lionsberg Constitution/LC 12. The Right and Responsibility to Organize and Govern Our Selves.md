# LC 12. The Right and Responsibility to Organize and Govern Our Selves

As One interexistent Body of Creation, we recognize the inherent and inalienable right and responsibility to voluntarily organize and govern our Selves in such a Way that Life and Society can flourish in Harmony. 

This includes the Divine Right and Responsibility to voluntarily enter into a System of Governance that is based of Love, mutual respect, and the collective pursuit of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. 

Recognizing the crises and opportunities at hand, and the failures and inadequacies of our Old Systems, without abdicating our rights and responsibilities relative to the Old Systems we hereby establish a New and Higher Order [[Lionsberg System of Governance]]. 

Our Intention is to establish a New Participatory System of Self-Governance that co-operates in parallel to the Old Systems, allowing us to retain their best features, benefits, and stabilizing affects, while affording the significant new capabilities required to enable us to confront and overcome the challenges and opportunities of a new era. 

We therefore pledge to rise towards [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] in service of One and All in order to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand, and pass the flame to [[Future Generations]].
