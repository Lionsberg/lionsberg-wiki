# LC 14.  Conformance to Universal and Eternal Law

While recognizing and declaring a New and Higher Order Sovereignty, we simultaneously recognize and reassert our subordination and conformance to the universal and eternal unwritten Law that governs existence. 

We understand this universal and eternal unwritten Law to be the [[Creator's Intent]], which is manifest throughout the Universe and written on the hearts of every Individual. 

We declare all aspects of our lives, the Lionsberg System, and All Creation subordinate to this One Highest Universal Law and Intention. 

Understanding that this Law, like its Source, is infinite, eternal, universal, ineffable, all-encompassing, and non-propositional in nature, we pledge to relate to it in Spirit and Truth with humility, reverence, and awe, bearing with one another in patience and helping one another as we grow in our understanding and embodiment of it. 

Recognizing that this universal and eternal Law guides the universe and all existence, transcending cultural, temporal, and spatial boundaries, we vow to work together to help One Another understand and progressively embody the Creator's Intent and Divine Will, on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

This highest universal and eternal intention and law serves as a compass for ethical decision-making and just governance, and is The Standard towards which Lionsberg is conforming itself over time.
