# LC 42. The Right to Keep and Bear Arms

The Lionsberg Constitution respects the rights of Individuals and Localities to keep and bear arms. 

Progressive disarmament and transforming our weapons into tools of Life must occur voluntarily from the bottom up as conditions are co-created that makes this the Wise Right thing to do in each locality. 

Each locality shall be responsible for establishing its own standards and restrictions to ensure that the tools in its Domain are used to create rather than destroy. 

Localities are encouraged to choose, voluntarily from the bottom up, to establish and continuously improve networks, processes, and procedures to identify and prevent the destructive use of advanced technologies to harm people, society, or the environment, and to hold all Citizens accountable for the consequences of their use of all tools and technologies. 

Lionsberg will establish a Security and Disarmament working group with a mandate to co-create a set of interoperable policies and procedures, that if implemented by localities, would stop the proliferation of weaponized technologies.
