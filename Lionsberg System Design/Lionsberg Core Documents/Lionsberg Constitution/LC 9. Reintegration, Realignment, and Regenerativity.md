# LC 9. Reintegration, Realignment, and Regenerativity

The Lionsberg System has been purpose-built to reintegrate and realign humanity with the Logos of the Living System and its Source. 

The Lionsberg System seeks to promote the integrated development and wellbeing of all levels and aspects of life, society and the environment across all time and space. Going far beyond mere sustainability, this holistic approach fosters harmony, resilience, and regenerativity across all [[Levels of Abstraction]], benefiting all present and future generations of Life and Consciousness. 

Rather than viewing Nature as a separate entity or resource to extract, the Lionsberg System and Approach places the Creator at the Center, and contextualizes humanity as one element in the Body of Creation. This transforms the core human role and responsibility to one of decentralized-yet-united regeneration, stewardship, and problem solving in service of [[One]] and [[All]].
