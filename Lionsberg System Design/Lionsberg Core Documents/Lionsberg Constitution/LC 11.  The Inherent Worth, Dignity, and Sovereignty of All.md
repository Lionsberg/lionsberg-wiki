# LC 11.  The Inherent Worth, Dignity, and Sovereignty of All

The Lionsberg System and Approach is rooted in the recognition that every individual and locality, regardless of their origin or circumstances, possesses as a consequence of their Divine Beginning inherent worth, dignity, and sovereignty. 

Our Intention to create an environment where the rights and responsibilities of every Individual and Locality are cultivated and upheld by Society, and their unique gifts are nurtured and celebrated.

The Divine Beginning of every Individual and Locality gives rise to a set of [[Universal Rights And Responsibilities]], among which are rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and potential within the bounds of the Universal Law of Love. 

As a consequence of their Divine Beginning, these rights are universal, eternal, and inalienable, and cannot be deprived by any power or authority on Earth. 

Through the recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals and localities and the universal sovereignty of the Creator, the Lionsberg System and the Lionsberg Constitution seek to create a world that is just, loving, and good, where all individuals have the opportunity to fulfill their potential and pursue their purpose in service of One and All, and where the collective pursuit of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] is balanced with the protection of individual and local autonomy, freedoms, rights, and responsibilities.
