# LC 30. The Lionsberg Communications System

To foster a society that is informed, connected, and responsive to the needs and aspirations of its citizens, we, the people of Lionsberg, establish the Lionsberg Communications System. This system is designed to facilitate open, transparent, and constructive communication throughout all levels of the Lionsberg System, horizontally and vertically. The Communications System ensures that all components of the Lionsberg System can regularly hear the collective sense-making and voice of the whole, and that the whole can regularly hear the collective sense-making and voice of the parts, and that all parts are able to hear one another if they so choose. 

## Principles

The Lionsberg Communications System is guided by the principles of Openness, Transparency, Inclusivity, Responsiveness, and Accessibility. It ensures that information flows freely, accurately, and efficiently throughout the system, enabling all members of society to participate fully and effectively in collective decision-making and action.

## Non-Censorship 

The Lionsberg Communications System is further guided by the principles of Truth and Non-Censorship, which insure that all Citizens are free to express Truth, Wisdom, and Discernment to the best of their ability, without fear of reprisal or suppression. 

## Double Linking

The Communications System is designed to provide "double linking" at all levels of the Lionsberg System. This means that every Citizen Assembly, Executive Body, Legislative Body, Regulatory Body, Reconciliation Body, and Justice Body is connected both upwards and downwards, allowing information and decisions to flow both ways. This double linking ensures that each level of the system is informed by, and can inform, both the levels above and below it.

## Ensuring the Voice of the Whole

The Communications System plays a crucial role in capturing and expressing the collective sense-making and voice of the Whole. Through various channels, it gathers input from all parts of the Lionsberg System, synthesizes this input into a coherent collective voice, and disseminates this voice throughout the system. This process ensures that the collective wisdom and will of the whole are heard and considered at all levels.

## Ensuring the Voice of the Parts

Additionally, the Communications System ensures that the collective sense-making and voice of each part of the Lionsberg System are heard by the whole. It provides channels for each part to communicate its experiences, perspectives, needs and aspirations to the rest of the system. This process ensures that the unique wisdom and will of each part are acknowledged and incorporated into the collective understanding and decision-making of the whole.

## Facilitating Inter-System Communication

The Communications System facilitates communication among the different systems within the Lionsberg System. It provides channels and protocols for the Citizen Assembly, Executive, Legislative, Regulatory, Reconciliation, and Justice systems to communicate with each other at each fractal level of the System, fostering understanding, collaboration, and mutual support among these systems.

## Facilitating Inner-System Communication

The Communications System also facilitates communication with each "Organ System" of Function of the collective Body. This ensures alignment, capacity building, continuous improvement, and problem solving can occur across vertical levels to elevate and transform the functioning of each system. 

## Communications Infrastructure

The Communications System is supported by a robust, secure, and resilient communications infrastructure that ensures the availability and reliability of communications throughout the Lionsberg System. This infrastructure is maintained and updated as necessary to keep pace with technological advancements and societal needs.

## Dealing with Disruptions

In the event of disruptions that impact the normal functioning of the Communications System, temporary measures may be instituted to ensure the continuity of communications. These measures must respect the spirit and principles of this constitution and should be discontinued as soon as normal operations can safely resume.

Through the Lionsberg Communications System, we strive to create a society that is connected, informed, and responsive - a society in which the voice of every citizen and every community is heard, and in which the collective wisdom and will of the whole guides our shared journey towards our destiny.
