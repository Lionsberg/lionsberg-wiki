# LC21. Citizen Led Joint Ventures

To minimize the size of the Core Enterprise and combat the threat over-centralization, Lionsberg encourages all Core Functions the Body to be accomplished through a decentralized array of Citizen Led Joint Ventures and Public Private Partnerships. 

These citizen-led joint ventures seek to promote innovation, collaboration, community engagement, and abundant provision of core functions and essential goods and services. These initiatives empower individuals to actively contribute to their society's development and wellbeing, distribute responsibility, increase local resiliency, reduce dependency, and keep government small.
