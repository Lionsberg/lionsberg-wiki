# LC 7. Creator's Intent

The best designs are unified by a single uniting Intention, which permeates every aspect of the Creation, from highest level concept and abstraction, to lowest level detail. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the Creator's Intent is best encapsulated by the concept of Absolute, Unconditional, Omni-Directional, and All-Encompassing [[Love]]. 

Therefore, we are reuniting and working together in partnership with the Creator and One Another to Co-Create a New World that places the Creator at the Center, and bases everything on Love. 

In this logic of Love, all individuated aspects of Creation are are subordinate to the One generating them, and all things are impelled to help one another rise towards the fullness of their Potential and flourish in harmony throughout the generations. 

We therefore establish [[Creator's Intent]] as the highest principle that aligns [[All]] Creation, the definition of [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]], and the foundation of the [[Universal Law]].
