# LC 32. The Lionsberg System of Integrated Wellbeing and Development

The [[Purpose]] of the Lionsberg System of Integrated Wellbeing and Development is to advance the mutually reinforcing physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health of all citizens, communities, and ecosystems. It is intended to support a network of services and resources that promote growth, resilience, and overall wellbeing at the individual, family, group, community, and planetary levels, leveraging both traditional and modern approaches. 

As we chart our collective journey towards our Destiny, we understand that our progress is deeply intertwined with the holistic wellbeing and development of all aspects of our society and environment. Recognizing this, we establish the Lionsberg System of Integrated Wellbeing and Development, a holistic approach to fostering wellbeing and progress that spans from the individual to the community, from the bioregional to the global, and includes our precious and interconnected Living System.

## Integrated Approach

The Lionsberg System of Integrated Wellbeing and Development adopts an integrated and systemic approach to wellbeing and development across all fractal scales of life and consciousness. It recognizes the interdependencies among different levels and aspects of wellbeing and development and seeks to balance and harmonize them across the entire social and Living System. It acknowledges that our actions at one level or in one aspect of wellbeing and development have impacts on other levels or aspects, and strives to minimize negative impacts and enhance positive synergies. The Intention is to forge an integrated system of holistic wellbeing and development in which All aspects of Creation help one another develop and enlighten towards the fullness of their individual and collective potential and flourish in harmony.
