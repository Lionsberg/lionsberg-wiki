# LC 47. Perpetuity and Secession

The Lionsberg System and Covenant Relationship between the Creator and All Creation is designed to enable a universal and  eternal Highest Order Functional Unity. 

While designed to be perpetual, it is based upon [[Liberty]] and [[Free Will]], and requires the ongoing [[Voluntary Consent]] of all parties involved. 

Therefore any Domain of Responsibility and Authority can secede from the Lionsberg Union at any time, on the basis of [[Consent]] among Citizens within the Domain. 

This means that a Sovereign Individual can secede from the Union at any time on the basis of their own internal conscience. 

Secession of a First Degree Group simply requires [[Consent]] among members of the Group. 

Secession of a Higher Order Group requires [[Consent]] among all participating Groups. 

Dissolving the Lionsberg Federation as a Whole also requires the [[Consent]] of all participating Groups.
