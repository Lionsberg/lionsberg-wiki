# LC 48. Social and Economic Justice

The Lionsberg Constitution strives to create the conditions for a society founded on principles of social, economic, and civic justice for All Citizens without exception, arising from the inherent Spiritual Justice bestowed upon All by the Creator. 

This Justice arises from the bottom up, prioritizing and protecting the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized first.
