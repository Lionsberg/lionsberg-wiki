# LC 4. One Creation

*2024.05.17 Draft For Review and Improvement*

We acknowledge that we are [[All]] part of [[One]] interexistent and interconnected [[Creation]], and that what we do to others or the world around us, we do to our Selves. 

We acknowledge that the air, the water, the land, and the microbiome have no inherent boundaries or borders but [[One]], and that All Creation is One Interrelated Family of Existence.
