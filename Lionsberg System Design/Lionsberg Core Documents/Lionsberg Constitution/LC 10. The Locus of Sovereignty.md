# LC 10. The Locus of Sovereignty

Upon this [[One]] Eternal Foundation, we are reuniting as **[[One Citizenship Under God]], [[Indivisible]], with [[Liberty]] and [[Justice]] for [[All]].** 

We recognize the [[Creator]] as the Ultimate Source of Sovereignty, to which [[All]] Creation is subordinate, and [[Creator's Intent]] as the Ultimate Source of Direction, to which [[All]] Creation aligns. 

We recognize the [[Individual]], made in the image of God, as the locus of Sovereignty, Responsibility and Authority on Earth. 

Upon this Divine basis, we recognize the inherent worth, dignity, and inalienable rights of [[All]] people and [[All]] Creation, interexisting and flowing from [[One]] Source and Sustainer of [[All]]. 

We reassert and reestablish our Divine Rights and Responsibilities as One Family of One Creator. 

We reassert and reaffirm the Sovereignty of God and the Sovereignty of each Individual, made in the image of God. 

We take back up our Divine Right and Responsibility to govern our Selves and our world in partnership with God and One Another. 

And we declare that no power or authority on Earth may rightfully exist except through the voluntary and ongoing consent and intent of Individual [[Sons and Daughters of God]] in each time and place.
