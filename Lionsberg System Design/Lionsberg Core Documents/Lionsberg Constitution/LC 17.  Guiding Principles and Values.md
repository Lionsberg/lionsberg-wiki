# LC 17.  Guiding Principles and Values

From this [[Central Animating Spirit]] flows the [[Golden Thread]] of the universal and eternal Wisdom, Principles, and Values that cause Life and Society to flourish in harmony with Living System that and [[One]] that creates and sustains them. 

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Principles and Values is unified by the One Ineffable Meta Value that contains and orders All other principles and values within Itself. All Propositional Values can be derived from this One Non-Propositional Meta Value. 

Among these derivative Values are [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], [[Wisdom]], [[Liberty]], [[Unity]], [[Beauty]], and [[Right Relationship Between One and All]]. 

From these Values flow core principles, such as: 

1.  The Ultimate Sovereignty of God 
2.  The Subordinate Sovereignty of the Individual and Local 
3.  Loving respect for the inherent worth, dignity, and potential of All beings  
4.  The moral imperative for sovereign beings to wisely organize and govern them Selves
5.  Commitment to the universal and eternal law
6.  Pursuit of wisdom, truth, and justice  
7.  Forthrightly confronting and overcoming endarkenment, ignorance, and injustice 
8.  Emphasis on collaboration, cooperation, and partnership between [[One]] and [[All]]  
9.  Dedication to regenerativity and stewardship on behalf of All Current and Future Generations 
10.  Prioritization of Right Relationship between One and All 
11.  Placing the Creator at the Center 
12.  Basing Everything on Love 
13.  Progressively Realizing the Creator's Intent on Earth as it is in Heaven 
14.  Progressively enlightening consciousness  

These foundational Principles and Values guide all aspects of governance, spirituality and socioeconomic systems in the Lionsberg System and the New World.

7.  **Right Relationship Between One and All:** The Lionsberg System recognizes the importance of the right relationship between [[One]] and [[All]] in all aspects of existence. The right relationship between [[All]] things and the [[One]] that Generates and Unites them is the foundation of peace, the basis of community, and the cornerstone of a harmonious society flourishing in Right Relationship with All Creation.
