# Provisional Trust Manifesto
Hello Friends and Allies, 

This document is being written in response to requests from the field for a "Trust Manifesto". 

The purpose of a Trust Manifesto is to establish a field of information that answers the core questions that people ask when they encounter something new. 

This document is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

## Name 
[[Lionsberg]] is a mythological name for the [[New World]] we are co-creating, and the Community that is co-creating it. 

The [[Meta Project]] is a descriptive name for the total Program of Action required of humanity to bring it into existence. 

Both flow from the same universal and eternal [[Meta Idea]]. 

For information on how we use the word [[Meta]] in the [[Lionsberg System]], see [[Meta]]. 

## Differentiation 
Whereas the [[Meta Project]] refers to the Absolute / highest level of abstraction, [[Lionsberg]] is being co-created to Instantiate / Embody the [[Meta Idea]] here in our place and time on earth. 

## Source Idea  
[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is the primary steward of the Source Idea. 

## Genesis of the Source Idea
Jordan has been consistently advancing towards this idea since a very young age. Because it points to the [[One Thing]] that all the Golden Threads laid through history originate from and lead back to, it has not changed. 

The Source Idea is, to the very best of our ability to discern and articulate it, what the [[Source]] has in [[Mind]]. 

As a builder of large scale heavy civil infrastructure, Jordan has been held accountable every day for decades for: 

1. Thoroughly understanding the Architect's Intent / [[Designer's Intent]]  
2. Thoroughly analyzing and understanding the existing forces and conditions bearing on a worksite 
3. Transforming the physical world to bring [[Intention Into Reality]]  

We are attempting to apply this same approach towards transforming [[Worksite Earth]] in its entirety within a single generation. 

The Genesis of the Source Idea was Jordan's attempt since a young age to search for Wisdom and understand to the best of his ability what [[One]] intends for [[All]]. 

As he thought about it at 12 years old, it felt like getting called up into an epic battle of Good and Evil for the future of Life and Civilization. Numerous outside observers and events reminded Jordan over the years of this highest calling, and encouraged him on in preparation. 

Not understanding how and at what time the events might unfold, Jordan took on as much responsibility as anyone would entrust him with, which led to extensive study of business, economics, finance, philosophy, production systems, martial arts, healing, and a career in building heavy civil infrastructure. 

As Jordan was caught up in building organizations and projects, there was a moment in time where his hypothesis was that if we could build a billion dollar portfolio of capital, real estate, construction, and technology companies, and steward them across multiple generations for the Good of All, a powerful step forward could be taken. 

Meditating on this in the water at 4:30 in the morning, this idea was powerfully shattered by the revelation that the last thing the world needed was someone to spend their lives building another billion dollar portfolio / foundation, and that in the midst the chaotic seas of hundreds of billions of dollars every year in philanthropic giving, and trillions of dollars every year in government spending, something far more fundamental and foundational was broken. 

The shattering revelation made it clear that the root issue was our [[Way of Being]] as a human species on planet earth, and that anything short of a fundamental transformation of our [[Way of Being]] would be mere charity that would continue to subsidize and obscure the true root causes of suffering and injustice. 

It also made it entirely clear that the fundamental transformation of Life and Consciousness on Earth was actually, spiritually, socially, and mathematically _possible_ within a single generation. 

Jordan wrote frantically for about two hours, downloading the essence of the revelation and its general contours and plan. 

It was akin to the first "back of the napkin" sketch an Architect might do, before progressively creating the [[Meta Project Plans and Specifications|Plans and Specifications]] over the coming years, and then overseeing their implementation into Reality. 

After 33 years of building Consciousness and pondering, there was finally a tangible and concrete [[Path]], [[Milestones]], and [[Program of Action]] that _might work_. 

As he struggled to disentangle himself from [[Old World]] agreements and obligations that were incompatible with this new yet eternal understanding, Jordan began discovering and gathering wise advisors to look through a builders lens at the total transformation of [[Worksite Earth]] in a single generation, FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]]. 

It took several years of intensely focused thought and consciousness to discern and flesh out the overall hypothesis of a [[Critical Path]] and Design that actually _might work_ within the available [[Time]]. 

Having developed an approximate understanding of the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]], Jordan and his teams and advisors did extensive research to attempt to find an existing effort, that if fully resourced and driven to its ultimate and logical conclusion, would accomplish [[The Goal]] with a reasonable probability of success. 

Unable to find one, and yet discovering countless heroic efforts and lifetimes of work around the world moving in the same spirit towards the same ultimate goal, they realized that a [[New]] community, system, and structure would need to be designed and built that could connect up, serve, and empower the distributed global community of goodwill to act as one body and mind to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] inherent in the overarching and uniting [[Meta Intention]] / [[Meta Goal]]. 

For more depth, imagery and vision of the [[New World]], see [[Best Possible Future]]. 

## Corruption and Injustice 
Not surprisingly, the path towards [[The Goal]] was interrupted by Jordan's encounters with the spirit that corrupts government and religious institutions on two of his largest projects at the time. 

As Jordan's naïveté collided with and shined light into corrupted power structures of church and state, Jordan and his team members were threatened and retaliated against, ultimately resulting in the loss of their largest company, home, and net worth in the midst of the pandemic in 2021. 

## The Reemergence of Lionsberg
Thankfully, the corruption and destruction occurred before the Old companies were transferred into the New [[Provisional Structure]] that was under intense construction. 

By the beginning of 2022, Jordan and his family had healed and recovered from the descent into chaos, and the technological backbone had been developed to a point where the experiment could begin. 

In Q1 2022, Jordan gathered a "Social Dimensions" advisory group, which spent approximately two months meeting weekly to discuss the conditions that would need to be co-created to begin convening and moving across the network of existing efforts. 

In April, Jordan invited some close friends and allies into a 6 week social experiment to explore aligning around 1) Intention 2) Analysis 3) Engagement 4) Planning 5) Action and 6) Continuous Improvement. 

There was enough energy coming out of the social experiment to continue, so on May 15, 2022 the first official 6 week cycle of the Lionsberg | Meta Project began.
