# Provisional Trust Manifesto
Hello Friends and Allies, 

This document is being written in response to requests from the field for a "Trust Manifesto". 

The purpose of a Trust Manifesto is to establish a field of information that answers the core questions that people ask when they encounter something new. 

This document is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

## Name 
[[Lionsberg]] is a mythological name for the [[New World]] we are co-creating, and the Community that is co-creating it. 

The [[Meta Project]] is a descriptive name for the total Program of Action required of humanity to bring it into existence. 

Both flow from the same universal and eternal [[Meta Idea]]. 

For information on how we use the word [[Meta]] in the [[Lionsberg System]], see [[Meta]]. 

## Differentiation 
Whereas the [[Meta Project]] refers to the Absolute / highest level of abstraction, [[Lionsberg]] is being co-created to Instantiate / Embody the [[Meta Idea]] here in our place and time on earth. 

## Source Idea  
[[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is the primary steward of the Source Idea. 

## Genesis of the Source Idea
Jordan has been consistently advancing towards this idea since a very young age. Because it points to the [[One Thing]] that all the Golden Threads laid through history originate from and lead back to, it has not changed. 

The Source Idea is to try to Realize what the [[Source]] has in Mind, or - the Highest Intention and Greatest Good for All. 

As a builder of large scale heavy civil infrastructure, Jordan has been held accountable every day for decades for: 

1. Thoroughly understanding the Architect's Intent / [[Designer's Intent]]  
2. Thoroughly analyzing and understanding the existing forces and conditions bearing on a worksite  
3. Transforming the physical world to bring [[Intention Into Reality]]  

We are attempting to apply this same approach towards transforming [[Worksite Earth]] in its entirety within a single generation. 

The Genesis of the Source Idea was Jordan's attempt since a young age to search for Wisdom and understand to the best of his ability what [[One]] intends for [[All]].  

As he thought about it at 12 years old, it felt like getting called up into an epic battle of Good and Evil for the future of Life and Civilization. Numerous outside observers and events reminded Jordan over the years of the highest calling, and encouraged him on in preparation.  

Not understanding how and at what time the events might unfold, Jordan took on as much responsibility as anyone would entrust him with, which led to extensive study of business, economics, finance, philosophy, production systems, martial arts, healing, human development, and a career in building heavy civil infrastructure. 

As Jordan was caught up in building organizations and projects, there was a moment in time where his hypothesis was that if we could build a billion dollar portfolio of capital, real estate, construction, and technology companies, and steward them across multiple generations for the Good of All, a powerful step forward could be taken. 

Meditating on this in the water at 4:30 in the morning, this idea was powerfully shattered by the revelation that the last thing the world needed was someone to spend their lives building another billion dollar portfolio / foundation, and that in the midst the chaotic seas of hundreds of billions of dollars every year in philanthropic giving, and trillions of dollars every year in government spending, something far more fundamental and foundational was broken. 

The shattering revelation made it clear that the root issue was our [[Way of Being]] as a human species on planet earth, and that anything short of a fundamental transformation of our [[Way of Being]] would be mere charity that would continue to subsidize and obscure the true root causes of suffering and injustice. 

It also made it entirely clear that the fundamental transformation of Life and Consciousness on Earth was actually, spiritually, socially, and mathematically _possible_ within a single generation. 

Jordan wrote frantically for about two hours, downloading the essence of the revelation and its general contours and plan. 

It was akin to the first "back of the napkin" sketch an Architect might do, before progressively creating the [[Meta Project Plans and Specifications|Plans and Specifications]] over the coming years, and then overseeing their implementation into Reality. 

After 33 years of building Consciousness and pondering, there was finally a tangible and concrete [[Path]], [[Milestones]], and [[Program of Action]] that _might work_. 

As he struggled to disentangle himself from [[Old World]] agreements and obligations that were incompatible with this new yet eternal understanding, Jordan began discovering and gathering wise advisors to look through a builders lens at the total transformation of [[Worksite Earth]] in a single generation, FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]]. 

It took several years of intensely focused thought and consciousness to discern and flesh out the overall hypothesis of a [[Critical Path]] and Design that actually _might work_ within the available [[Time]]. 

Having developed an approximate understanding of the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]], Jordan and his teams and advisors did extensive research to attempt to find an existing effort, that if fully resourced and driven to its ultimate and logical conclusion, would accomplish [[The Goal]] with a reasonable probability of success, in a reasonable amount of Time. 

Unable to find one, and yet discovering countless heroic efforts and lifetimes of work around the world moving in the same spirit towards the same ultimate goal, they realized that a [[New]] community, system, and structure would need to be designed and built that could connect up, serve, and empower the distributed global community of goodwill to act as one body and mind to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] inherent in the overarching and uniting [[Meta Intention]] / [[Meta Goal]]. 

For more depth, imagery and vision of the [[New World]], see [[Best Possible Future]]. 

## Corruption and Injustice 
Not surprisingly, the path towards [[The Goal]] was interrupted by Jordan's encounters with the spirit that corrupts government and religious institutions on two of his largest projects at the time. 

As Jordan's naïveté collided with and shined light into corrupted power structures of church and state, Jordan and his team members were threatened and retaliated against, ultimately resulting in the loss of their largest company, home, and net worth in the midst of the pandemic in 2021. 

## The Reemergence of Lionsberg
Thankfully, the corruption and destruction occurred before the Old companies were transferred into the New [[Provisional Structure]] that was under intense construction. 

By the beginning of 2022, Jordan and his family had healed and recovered from the descent into chaos, and the technological backbone had been developed to a point where the social experiment could begin. 

In Q1 2022, Jordan gathered a "Social Dimensions" advisory group, which spent approximately two months meeting weekly to discuss the conditions that would need to be co-created to begin convening and moving across the network of existing efforts. 

In April, Jordan invited some close friends and allies into a 6 week social experiment to explore aligning around 1) Intention 2) Analysis 3) Engagement 4) Planning 5) Action and 6) Continuous Improvement. 

There was enough energy coming out of the social experiment to continue, so on May 15, 2022 the first official 6 week cycle of the Lionsberg | Meta Project began. 

## Pattern Integrity
The [[Fundamental Tone]], to which all other elements of the System, Pattern, and Community are tuned is [[Love]]. Or a level deeper, the [[Source]] of Love, Life, and Consciousness. 

[[Love]] is the single overarching and uniting Design Principle of the entire [[Lionsberg System]].  

[[Love]] implies within Itself and calls forth all other [[Values]], including Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Goodness, and Beauty. 

These Universal / [[Core Values]] are united by a single highest overarching and uniting [[Meta Value]], that coheres the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], and therefore the Integrity of the [[Pattern Language]]. 

The core Pattern Integrity requirement of the [[Lionsberg System]] is that it coheres to the [[Pattern Language]] of Nature, the Universe, and its [[Source]]. 

If any element of the [[Lionsberg System]] does not cohere with the [[Pattern Language]] of the [[Living System]] and its Source, then it is a human failure to properly discern, design and build in accordance with the [[Meta Idea]]. If this occurs, the element that is out of coherence must be elevated and transformed into harmony with the [[Fundamental Tone]]. 

If this Core Pattern is violated, then the [[Designer's Intent]] cannot be [[Realize|Realized]], and the [[Universal Symphony]] cannot sound. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed as a [[Way]] to reintegrate the entire [[Human System]] with the [[Living System]] and its [[Source]], within a single generation. 

The core design criteria of [[Absolute]] and total reintegration of the [[Human System]], in its entirety, with the [[Living System]], in its entirety, with the [[Source]] from which Life and Consciousness flow is the non-negotiable core element of the [[Meta Idea]]. 

From this all other [[Values]], features, and benefits of the System can be discerned, such that the System meets the needs and solves the problems inherent in every community of Life as All communities of Life struggle upwards towards [[The Goal]]. 

## Transformations Over Time 
To our [[Current Best Understanding]], the [[Meta Idea]] is universal, eternal, and unchanging. 

The universe and our understanding and embodiment of it transform over time, while the [[Meta Idea]] remains the same. 

The [[Meta Idea]] / [[Meta Intention]] / [[Meta Goal]] remains eternal and unchanging, as we work to elevate and transform our Selves, our Lives, and our World upwards towards it. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] must therefore be built to help [[All]] things elevate and transform themselves across All Time and Space towards [[The Goal]]. 

## Evolutionary / Transformational Purpose
The evolutionary / transformational purpose of the Source Idea is to invite [[All]] things up into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Just as an individual human being must integrate their various sub-drives and sub-personalities into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of functioning in Nature and Society... 

... so too must the entire human species now mature and integrate its various sub-drives, sub-personalities, and sub-tribes and nations into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of functioning eternally and universally in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]], or Nature and its [[Source]]. 

Said differently, the evolutionary purpose of [[Lionsberg]] is the transformation and re-integration of the entire human species / [[Human System]] into harmony, alignment, and [[Right Relationship]] with the [[Living System]] and its [[Source]]. 

## Vision of the Future 
As a result of the [[Source Idea]] being made manifest through our collective efforts over the coming years... 

Some bright morning, not too many years from now... 

We will awaken to an entirely New Dawn. 

Each of 8 billion human beings will have been personally invited into a [[New]] and entirely transformed [[Way of Being]] that is superior in every Way to the [[Old]]. 

We will have risen above the shallow and petty lines that formerly divided us, and we will be connected and [[Right Relationship|Rightly Related]] to [[One Another]], [[One]] and [[All]].  

The Dreams and Prophesies will be fulfilled. 

Unnecessary corruption, injustice, suffering, poverty and hunger will have been vanquished. 

We will have transformed our weapons into tools of flourishing and abundant life. 

Every person on earth will have access to a lifelong program of spiritual, intellectual, and physical learning, wellbeing, and development. 

We will dwell together within the [[Conditions]] that we have co-created once every [[Conditions of Satisfaction|Condition of Satisfaction]] has been met. 

We will engage together in meaningful community, relationship and play.  

We will engage together in challenging and meaningful work that advances [[All]] Creation towards the [[The Goal]].  

The water, the soil, and the air will be regenerated and made [[New]] and clean. 

It will be a place purpose-built to help All Life and Consciousness develop into the fullness of its [[Potential]] and flourish in harmony. 

We will be living out the [[Patterns of Life] / [[Patterns of Success]],  and avoiding the [[Patterns of Death]] / [[Patterns of Failure]].  

It might look, feel, and smell something like the Vision described in the [[Best Possible Future]]. 

The [[Universal Symphony]] will sound, as all Creation harmonizes their unique instruments to the [[Fundamental Tone]]. 

It will be something like [[Heaven]] on Earth, and although it already feels perfect, it will be continuing to [[Get A Little Better Every Day]] because we are all striving together in harmony to make it so. 

The [[Best Possible Future]] is here and already at hand, the moment that all humanity decides to lay down its arms and work together to co-create it for the the Good of [[All]] past, present, and future generations of Life and Consciousness. 

## Current State August 2022
As we began the third 6 week cycle in August 2022, the state was as follows: 

- The [[Provisional Structure]] was in place. 
- The [[Core Documents]] were in a Provisional State. 
- The Patterns of [[Organize and Federate|Organizing and Federating]] had been established. 
- A few dozen people were actively participating, and several dozen more attending, following along, and waiting.  
- Numerous partnership discussions and expansion opportunities were in play  
- The [[Core Infrastructure]] had advanced far enough to begin creating marketplace and economy  
- It was an entirely voluntary effort of good human beings, advancing in goodwill, towards [[The Goal]]  
- We were working on [[Value Creation]], and learning to notice [[Value]] as it was being created in-stride. 
- We were beginning to formalize presentations of [[Value Creation]] - [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]].  
- It felt wobbly. It felt vulnerable. It felt exciting. It felt [[New]]. 
- Some people had grown frustrated or impatient and stepped back. 
- Some people had generated new enthusiasm and stepped forward. 
- We had our first committed and blocked hours to apply to the [[Critical Path]]. 
- We were preparing to establish our first Opportunities, Offers, and Needs Marketplace. 
- We were preparing to engage our first extended Pull Planning session to see ahead into the [[Milestones]] and [[Critical Path]]. 
- We had determined the Core Teams that needed to formalized and structured. 
- We had network nodes representing thousands of incredible people circling, watching, and wondering... 
- [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] was holding space and risk as the sole board member and funding source 
- It was reported that the backbone technological infrastructure we had funded was being leveraged by ~170 impact organizations in ~13 countries  
- Some of the most talented, skilled, and wise people we had ever worked with were surrounding us and investing time, energy, and attention  
- And we were ready to advance into the next round of resourcing, partnership and engagement.
