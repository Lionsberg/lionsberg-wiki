# Core Documents
This section in an index of the Core Documents, which are currently being drafted, with a target completion date for a provisional version by July 2, 2022. 

We will [[Act As If]] the Provisional Documents are official, so that we can learn from and continuously improve them. 

When the Provisional Documents have been complexified and accurately reflect what we are acting out, and what we are acting out reflects the patterns and behaviors we believe are most just, wise, and good, we will formalize the documents. 

It is expected that the provisional documents will be formalized by the fall of 2024.
