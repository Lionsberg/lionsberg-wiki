# Core Documents
This section in an index of the Core Documents, which are a [[Work In Progress]]. 

We will [[Act As If]] the Provisional Documents are official, so that we can learn from and continuously improve them. 

When the Provisional Documents have been complexified and accurately reflect what we are acting out, and what we are acting out reflects the patterns and behaviors we believe are most just, wise, and good, we will harden / formalize the documents as part of our System of Governance.

[[Provisional Code]]
