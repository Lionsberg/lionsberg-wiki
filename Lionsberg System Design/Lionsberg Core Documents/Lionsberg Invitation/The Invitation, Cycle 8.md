### A Moment of Destiny

Humanity is at a pivotal point in its Journey. The path we are collectively on isn't working. As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], it is apparent that the systems, institutions, and ways of being that led us here can't carry us forward to [[The Future]] we dream of—a world filled with peace, justice, abundance, opportunity and freedom for our children and future generations. Despite our vast diversity, we share a common [[Vision]] for [[The Future We Seek]], and understand the [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that must guide us there.

### The Dawn of a Movement

On March 1st, we transitioned from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning|seven years of preparation]] to a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to rebuild the foundations of our society and catalyze a movement towards [[The Future We Seek]]. This movement aims to reunite citizens in transforming our society and healing our planet by inviting each person, one by one, to awaken, arise, and become [[Co-Creators]] of the [[Better World]] we know is possible and intended to be. Our goal is to engage at least 3% of the global population by 2026 (~250 Million Individuals), creating for the first time in history a powerful, decentralized [[Force For Good]] capable of working together to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand. With Life and its Source at The Center. 

### The First Seven Cycles of Growth 

In just seven short weeks, we were able to complete the first seven [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], connecting the first 30 to 40 [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] while surfacing a list of over 100 of the [[Wise Right People]] to invite in next. 

[[Above The Chaos, The 10 Year Movement, Grand Strategy, and the Greatest Celebration in History|The 10 Year Movement, Grand Strategy, and the Greatest Celebration in History]], a post in the [[Above The Chaos]] series, highlights some of the exciting individuals, teams, projects, and initiatives that are coalescing and exploring how we can unite our efforts. 

Just imagine the gifts, talents, and relationships that the next hundred co-creators will bring to the great banquet table. All that is missing is You.

### Your Role in This Epic Journey

We invite you to join us in this decentralized movement, where connected and empowered small groups work locally and globally to tackle the [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]] that advance the [[Critical Path]] towards a thriving, regenerative world. Your mission, should you accept it, is to join the movement, forge or join a team, engage in meaningful conversations and quests, tell the stories of transformation that result, and inspire others to do the same.

### The Invitation: Join Us in Shaping the Future

Despite [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning|years of careful preparation]], this movement is more than a strategy and plan; it is an invitation to the adventure and opportunity of a lifetime - a epic journey into the [[Unknown]], fueled by our collective Spirit and Unity. We are Co-Creating a [[New Story]] together—one of hope, transformation, and fellowship.
