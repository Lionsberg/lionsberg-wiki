### A Moment of Destiny

Humanity is at a pivotal point in its Journey. The path we are collectively on isn't working. As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], it is apparent that the systems, institutions, and ways of being that led us here will not carry us forward to [[The Future]] we dream of—a world filled with peace, love, justice, abundance, opportunity and freedom for our children, grandchildren, and future generations. Despite our vast diversity, we share a common [[Vision]] for [[The Future We Seek]], and understand the [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that must guide us there.

### The Dawn of a Movement

On March 1st, we transitioned from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning|Seven Years of Preparation]] to a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to rebuild the foundations of our society and catalyze a movement towards [[The Goal]]. This movement aims to reunite citizens in transforming our society and regenerating our planet by inviting individuals to awaken, arise, and become [[Co-Creators]] of the [[Better World]] we know is possible and intended to be. Our aim is to connect, equip, and empower [[The First Three Percent]] of the population by 2026 (~250 Million Individuals), creating a powerful and optimally decentralized [[Force For Good]] capable of working together to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. Following this significant milestone, we will progressively invite all humanity to take up an equal [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New Era]] we are co-creating. 

### The First Eight Cycles of Growth 

We are monitoring the growth of the movement using the metaphor of a Sacred Tree emerging from  [[The Golden Seed]]. Over the first ~90 days, we completed the first eight [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], connecting the first 60+ [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] while surfacing a list of over 140 of the [[Wise Right People]] to invite in next. 

### Cycle 9 

Cycle 9 will grow [[The Movement]] out to 89 carefully selected Co-Creators, paving the Way towards the first [[Quarterly Summit]] in July, and followed by the first [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] in late September. 

[[Above The Chaos, The 10 Year Movement, Grand Strategy, and the Greatest Celebration in History|The 10 Year Movement, Grand Strategy, and the Greatest Celebration in History]], a post in the [[Above The Chaos]] series, highlights some of the exciting individuals, teams, projects, and initiatives that are coalescing. 

Imagine the gifts, talents, and relationships that the next hundred co-creators will bring to the great banquet table. All that is missing is You!

5. [[Pass The Flame]], and inspire others to do the same  

### The Invitation: Join Us in Shaping the Future

Emerging from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning|years of careful preparation]], this movement is more than a strategy and plan; it is an [[Invitation to the Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]] - a epic journey into the [[Unknown]], fueled by our collective Spirit and Unity. We are Co-Creating a [[New Story]] together—one of hope, transformation, and fellowship.
