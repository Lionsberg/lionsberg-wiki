# The Invitation
*Cycle 1, March 2024*

If you are receiving this, you are one of a select group of people I am inviting to join me for what I hope and pray evolves into a history-making-adventure-of-a-lifetime. At any rate, we will learn and grow *a lot* by attempting the experiment. 

As you know, everything is on the line, and it is up to [[Us]] to take responsibility, commit, and do all that is required to meet the needs, solve the challenges, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

This is the start of a simple-yet-sophisticated tipping-point-strategy to invite humanity to collaborate and transform its Way of Being as a human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]] over the next 10 years. 

You probably have a good idea of what you are getting into knowing me, but I have written some more detail at the links below. The first two provide some thoughts heading into the New Year. **Running The Play** outlines the simple path forward to begin inviting Individuals of Goodwill to Join The Movement. 

And the **Game Plan for March** lays out the specific steps and goals to activate the next phase of the Strategy and Plan in March 2024. Each also contains an abundance of links to explore various elements of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to meet this moment in history. 

Here are the links: 

- [[Above The Chaos, Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto]]  
- [[Above The Chaos, January 2024 Letter to Friends, Loved Ones, and Network]]  
- [[Above The Chaos, Running The Play]]  
- [[Above The Chaos, Game Plan For March]]  

If you really want to dive into more detail, explore: 

- [[Above The Chaos]] for a stream of posts, interviews, etc.  
- [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] for more formalized and structured presentations  

This invitation is going to several select several individuals globally, as well as here locally in Sandpoint, Idaho. If a few Individuals in each group accept, we will be on the Path, and will work together to craft an invitation to subsequent Individuals in our networks. 

To accept this invitation, visit my website and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement). The form will gather an opening tithe (crucial for legally establishing public support for The Mission), along with your contact information (crucial for our Communication System). 

I look forward to working together with you to make our Community and our World as much like [[Heaven On Earth]] as we possibly can, while Passing The Flame to the rising generations. 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J
