# The Invitation
*Cycle 1, February 2024*

In [[Above The Chaos, Running The Play|Running The Play]], I laid out a simple play we can run to meet this moment in history. To catch up in more detail, see my 2024 posts in [[Above The Chaos]]. 

After years of preparation and numerous social experiments the last two years, [[The Play]] is my last best hope to avert catastrophe. 

_It only requires that enough of us **believe**._ 

[[Progress]] through the first [[Milestones]] requires that the few people accept this invitation to [[Membership In Lionsberg]], and commit to working together to do *whatever is required to advance the play*. Come what may. With everything on the line for generations to come, we are going to succeed or die trying.  

Because Lionsberg is *invitation only*, the first members will be absolutely crucial in shaping the culture, forming early teams, bringing in subsequent members, and ensuring that The Play avoids failure and succeeds. 

Like the Fellowship of the Ring, this invitation to the first few is a daring call to adventure into the [[Unknown]],  to do what has not been done before in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Members will need to demonstrate, enact, and embody the [[Way]] we want humanity to be. This [[Path]] will require Discipline, Learning, Growth, Sacrifice, and Hard Work. It will require that we learn to co-operate and continuously improve. The farther we [[Progress]], the more dangerous, challenging, and exciting it will become.

And together we can make it the most meaningful, joyful, fulfilling experience of our lives. 

With the future of humanity and life on earth hanging in the balance, I am inviting you to join me for the adventure of a lifetime. 

Please let me know if you are in as a founding member by Sunday the February 11th. 

Since the first cycle requires only one person to accept the invitation, and since my wife has agreed, next week we will begin Cycle 2 no matter what with whoever is willing to join us :) 

It is all on the line. This may be our last shot. Let's succeed or die trying. 

Onward Towards [[The Goal]],
