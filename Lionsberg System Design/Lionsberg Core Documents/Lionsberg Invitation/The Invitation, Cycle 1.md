# The Invitation
*Cycle 1, February 2024*

I would like to invite you to the adventure of a lifetime. 

## A Context of Crisis and Change 

As you know from [[Above The Chaos]] and the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], my [[Current Best Understanding]] is that we are facing a [[Meta Crisis]] of unprecedented proportion. 

In 10 years, our lives and our world will look dramatically different. Armed with tools 10x more powerful than anything humanity has possessed in history, the vessel of society will rapidly accelerate towards the logical end of the trajectory *we choose.*

I am deeply concerned that our current trajectory is fundamentally defined by deep patterns of failure, including abjectly corrupt power structures weaponizing deceit and ever-more-powerful force to keep humanity and our planet divided, conquered, and exploited. 

There is a significant non-zero probability that the corrupted existing Order is failing, and that what is rising to take its place on the other side of [[Collapse]] and [[World War]] will be *far worse*. 

_____
## Good News 

But there is good news. 

If *we choose* to Love One Another, Help One Another, and Aim Up at the Highest Intention and Greatest Good, in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]] we can confront and overcome the challenges at hand and forge ***a future for [[All]] that is better than Any has enjoyed in the past***. 

It simply requires that enough people *believe* and *unite*. Quickly enough. 

_____
## How We Got Here 

Anticipating this moment, over the last seven years, I worked with allies around the world to forge a vision, system, platform, strategy, and plan to ***invite*** humanity to wake up, change course, avert catastrophe, and work together to co-create the best possible future for All.

The last two years, the technological backbone was tested with hundreds of groups in dozens of countries, and I experimented and learned that the only unit of agency on earth that can move and respond quickly and wisely enough is ***The Individual***. 

## Where We Are Going 

Over the next seven years, as the world shakes and transforms in unprecedented ways, the simple plan is for each individual on earth to receive an invitation (or 10) from those they know and love to voluntarily join us in ***Playing a New Game***. 

The New Game will retain the best features of our existing world, while affording the significant new benefits, capabilities, and higher order functional unity required to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand in this New Millennium. 

If we [[All]] decided to play The Game, it would simply become the New Way we worked together, made decisions, solved problems, accomplished goals, and governed our selves as a human species. 

_____

## The Quest Towards The Goal 

The object of The Great Game is to work together in partnership with the Creator and All Creation to confront and overcome the grand challenges and co-create the Best Possible Future For All, while passing the flame to the next generation. 

Succeeding in The Quest requires that we work together to awaken and liberate every individual and locality from all forms of suffering, injustice, and oppression...

...venture together through [[The Wilderness]] that marks the Way towards [[The Goal]]...

...help and heal One Another... 

...cross [[The Chasm]]... 

...confront and overcome [[The Giants]]... 

...prevail in [[The War]]... 

...transform our weapons into tools of life... 

...and co-create a thriving society and flourishing world that continues to get a little better every day as we work together in harmony to make it so. 

____
## Milestones and Measurement 

Because none of us aboard Earth can reach the [[The Promised Land]] unless and until we [[All]] do, the [[Milestones]] that mark the Way towards [[The Goal]] are determined by how far how many individuals have progressed on [[The Quest]]. 

_____
## An Invitation To Play 

In [[Above The Chaos, Running The Play|Running The Play]], I laid out a simple play to begin The Great Game. 

It simply requires that a wise right group of initial players commit to working together to do *whatever is required to iterate the next cycle and advance the play*. Come what may. 

Because The Game is *invitation only*, the first players will be absolutely crucial in shaping the Culture, forming the early Teams, inviting in subsequent Players, and ensuring that The Quest progresses, avoids failure, and succeeds. 

This invitation to *The Fellowship of The Quest* is a daring call to adventure into the [[Unknown]], to Progress towards [[The Goal]], and to do what has not been done before in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

___
## An Offer, and Request 

What I have to offer each Player in The Great Game is all that I am, the adventure of a lifetime, and a transformational program of personal development that will not leave any of us the same. Additionally, I can offer membership in Lionsberg, and thereby access to the Community and Commons of resources, relationships, infrastructure, and technology we have curated together as an empowering starting point. We have invested and sacrificed millions of dollars and far more blood, sweat and tears to create the starting point. It is my gift to you. 

What I request of each Player is a Commitment to play by The Rules, to co-operate in a Spirit of Power and Love, and to reciprocally contribute a predictable amount of time and resources each week to help advance the Critical Path towards The Goal. 

All Progress will be made by decentralized, self-governing and autonomous Teams that Players are responsible for self-organizing. Teams can leverage the Lionsberg infrastructure to raise funds and resource aligned Quests. All Teams are expected to share the first 1/10th of their available flow of time and resources to coordinating with, governing and empowering the Whole as we advance together in harmony towards The Goal. 

____
## Conclusion and Call to Action

With the future of humanity and life on earth hanging in the balance, I am inviting you to join me for the adventure of a lifetime. 

Please let me know via email or text if you would like to play ASAP. As soon as the first individual accepts The Invitation, The Great Game will begin. I would love to start playing Monday February 19th if you are willing. 

It is all on the line. This may be our last shot. Let's not fail. 

Onward Towards [[The Goal]],
