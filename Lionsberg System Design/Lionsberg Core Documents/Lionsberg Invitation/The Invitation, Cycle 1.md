# The Invitation
*Cycle 1, March 2024*

If you are receiving this, you are one of a select group of people I am inviting to join me for what I hope and pray evolves into a history-making-adventure-of-a-lifetime. At any rate, we will learn and grow *a lot* by attempting the experiment. 

As you know, everything is on the line, and it is up to [[Us]] as [[Individuals]] to take responsibility, commit, and do all that is required to meet the needs, solve the challenges, and accomplish the goals at hand. Together. 

March marks the inflection point between the end of [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], and the beginning of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

This is the start of a simple-yet-sophisticated tipping-point-strategy through which all humanity will be invited to collaborate to transform its Way of Being as a human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]], and to ensure that [[The Transformation]] occurs within a single generation. 

You probably have a good idea of what you are getting into knowing me, but I have written some more detail at the links below. The first two provide some thoughts heading into the New Year. **Running The Play** outlines the simple path forward to begin inviting Individuals of Goodwill to Join The Movement. 

And the **Game Plan for March** lays out the specific steps and goals to activate the next phase of the Strategy and Plan. Each also contains an abundance of links to explore various elements of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to meet this moment in history. 

If you are only going to skim one, read [[Above The Chaos, Game Plan For March|Game Plan For March]].

If you want to dive into more detail, explore: 

- [[Above The Chaos]] for a stream of posts, interviews, etc.  
- [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] for more formalized and structured presentations of [[The Idea]].  

This invitation is going to several select several individuals globally, as well as here locally in Sandpoint, Idaho. If a few Individuals in each group accept, we will be on the Path, and will work together to refine [[The Story]] and craft the invitation to subsequent Individuals in our networks. 

Our Mission will be to transform our lives and our world towards Heaven on Earth by forging the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] required to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

To accept this invitation, visit my website and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement). The form will gather an opening tithe (crucial for establishing commitment and public support for The Mission), along with your contact information (crucial for populating our Communication System). 

I look forward to working together with you to make our Community and our World as much like [[Heaven On Earth]] as we possibly can, while Passing The Flame to the rising generations. 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J
