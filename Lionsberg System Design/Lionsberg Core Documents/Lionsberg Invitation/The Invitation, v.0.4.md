# The Invitation
*v.0.4 January 2024*

In the face of the present [[Meta Crisis]], we are assembling for the purpose of: 

1. Confronting and overcoming the grand challenges  
2. Accomplishing our goals and values 
3. Forging the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

We recognize that no individual, group, or locality can succeed in these objectives in isolation. It is therefore necessary to forge some kind of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among the forces of [[Goodwill]] capable of meetings the needs and solving the challenges at hand. 

We envision a freely independent, self-governing, self-sustaining, and self-replicating [[Group Of Groups]], co-operating as [[One Citizenship Under God]]. 

To enable progress towards this Aim, Jordan and a network of allies have curated and co-created a platform of empowering resources, infrastructure, and technology. 

If you resonate and would like to [[Join Us]], email J@Lionsberg.org or visit [Jordan's Website](https://jordannicholas.org) and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement).  

Onward Towards [[The Goal]], 

~ J
