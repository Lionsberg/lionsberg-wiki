**A Platform, a Community, and a shared Meta Project**

What is [[The Goal]]? And how do we measurably bring it into reality for the good of [[All]] generations of life?

On any worksite, architects, engineers, and craftspeople work together to understand the [[Designer's Intent]] for the domain and bring it into reality. 

This occurs through a measurable network of commitments made and kept. 

[[Worksite Earth]] requires no less.

The leading practice in delivering the most complex, risky projects is the use of lean  integrated delivery processes that transform any program of action into a [[Goal Delivery System]]. 

We are launching a **system, platform and global community** that empowers **sovereign individuals, organizations and communities** to confront and overcome challenges and progress towards **local goals**, through a **global ecosystem** of interoperable resources, services, solutions, and technologies.

The **protocols** of the platform(s) will help ensure that local progress towards **local goals** is made in a way that helps, and does not harm, the progress of _all_ local communities towards our shared **shared global goals.**

**The Lionsberg | Meta Project**: Worksite: Earth.

**The Meta Goal**: The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life. 

**Methodology**: Lean Integrated Program Delivery + Interoperable Infrastructure Platform.  

**Individual & Local Initiative**: Empowered local initiative -> measurable local solutions and successes.  

**Scalable Global Solutions**: Best local solutions packaged, improved, replicated, and scaled as elements of a continuously improving [[Prototype]].  

**Adaptation & Interoperability**: Prototype components constitute a “kit of parts” for local and cultural adaptation.  

**Who?** Sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities who are passionate about helping one another discern and achieve local goals, while replicating and scaling global solutions, infrastructure, and learning. 

**Why us?** Because there is no “them” coming to solve our problems and save society. It is up to us. 

**What is possible if we succeed?** Meta success: All communities helping one another confront and overcome the complex of existential social, economic, political, and ecological threats stalking society.

**What is at stake if we fail?** Meta failure: Social, economic, political, and environmental suffering.  

**Multi-generational Stewardship**: Solutions and infrastructure will be stewarded for the good of all generations of life, and can become the backbone infrastructure of a better future.  

**Traction**: Platform and protocols are already in testing with over 150 organizations in over 15 countries around the world. 

**A Coalition of Sovereigns**: We are looking for independent, passionate, and truthful thinkers willing to take risk, responsibility and action together to transform our lives, our communities, and our world.

If sovereign individuals, organizations, and communities awaken, arise, and move together… anything is possible. Mountains are made to be moved. We have established an initial base camp for the quest at:
