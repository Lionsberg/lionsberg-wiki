# Provisional Structure 

For more information on the inception of the Lionsberg | Meta Project Structure, see [[1.2 Background and Context]] in the [[Integrated Delivery Guide]]. 

For a 30 minute introductory discussion from its creators, please see this [video](https://youtu.be/F5MAh4T15_s). 

For a consolidated visual diagram, please see the embedded PDF below. 

Core Concepts: 
1. At the deepest level, Lionsberg and the Meta Project are Ideas we are trying to bring into reality. 
2. One level up is the voluntary association or community of people around the world working together towards this end. 
3. One level up are those formally engaged in federating. 

_All of the levels above happen before any legal structure, and exist purely on the basis of voluntary collaboration, social structure, and governance structure. This is critical to protect the Sovereignty and Independence of the Idea and the Individuals collaborating. All structural elements are merely tools_. 

4. From time to time, in various domains, the Community will need to instantiate various form of legal infrastructure to interface with the existing systems, and accomplish its various goals. 
5. The diagram below illustrates the configuration of the first set of legal instantiations. The core infrastructure elements are already in existence. These include the red boxes (related to the non-profit) and the dark blue boxes (elated to for-profit entities). 
6. The Community will need to establish and federate conceptually similar structures around the world, and connect those structures together at the mycelial level to allow for the free exchange of resources and information. 

This is a starting point. A Prototype. A hypothesis. 

Please also remember that the Lionsberg System is designed to work as a Whole - this structure is purpose-built to protect the DNA and Processes that are bringing [[Intention Into Reality]].
