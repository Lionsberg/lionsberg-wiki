# Provisional Structure 

For more information on the inception of the Lionsberg / Meta Project Structure, see the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] and [[Lionsberg Summary]]. 

Simply, it is designed and built as a [[New Human Operating System]] and Structure, whose short term aim during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] is to invite all humanity to take up an equal, New, and Higher Order Citizenship in the [[Best Possible Future]] we can co-create in partnership the [[ONE]] and [[All]].

## 2025 Update

Having exposed [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]], We understand that We cannot comply Our Way out of Tyranny. 

Our structure for 2025 onward is rooted in the rapid transcendence of the [[Existing Order]]. 

[[The Lionsberg Alliance]] is a voluntary spiritual association of individuals, teams, and communities co-operating towards [[The Goal]]. 

This [[Association of Associations]] is *inherently and by definition* supranational and prior to any human or political authority. It and all its constituent / fractal elements are eternally free to self-organize and self-govern on the basis of the inalienable universal right to Freedom of Assembly and Freedom of Spirituality / Religion / Conscience. 

While transcending legal categorization *inherently and by definition*, it is presently free and tax exempt under domain-specific codes such as US 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) relating to [[Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Membership Association (PEVMA)]].

## 2024 and Before 

While rooting itself in transcendence, the **provisional structure** for [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] sought to comply with the [[Existing Order]]. 

From 2025 on - We are closing down the legal infrastructure and seeking to rapidly transcend the [[Existing Order]] entirely.

Core Concepts: 
1. At the deepest level, [[LIONSBERG]] exists as a Spiritual Body, co-creating in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]]; the [[Creator]] and [[All Creation]].  
	1. This is *essential* to ensure that [[The Grand Collaboration]] required to succeed is not subordinate to the authority or permission of any existing system, but rather is an outward expression of our spiritual and moral obligation to move together at local and planetary scale to meet this moment in history.  
2. The [[Meta Project]] and [[The Grand Collaboration]] are examples of [[Word Tools]] that point towards the overarching and uniting spiritual and moral imperative to [[Progressively Realize]] ([[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] / [[Creator's Intent]] / [[Heaven On Earth]]).  
3. One level up from the overarching and uniting Spirit / Intention / Goal is the overarching and uniting [[Voluntary Association]] of individuals around the world actively co-operating together towards [[The Goal]] - we often simply refer to this as [[The Lionsberg Alliance]]. 
	1. This [[Association of Associations]] is *inherently and by definition* supranational and prior to any human or political authority. It and all its constituent / fractal elements are eternally free to self-organize and self-govern on the basis of the inalienable universal right to Freedom of Assembly and Freedom of Spirituality / Religion. While transcending legal categorization *inherently and by definition*, it is free and tax exempt under domain-specific codes such as US 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) relating to [[Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Membership Association (PEVMA)]]. 
4. One level up from Individuals [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] [[Teams]], [[Groups]], and [[Communities]]. 
	1. Each can consider itself a [[Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Membership Association (PEVMA)]] by default unless otherwise organized and differentiated.     
5. The [[Lionsberg Manifesto]], [[Lionsberg Constitution]] and other foundational writings including the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] help hold the space for this higher order, omniconsiderate, covenantal relationship among Citizens of Goodwill around the world and Beyond. 
6. The Lionsberg System is designed as an Invitational Platform to connect and empower each human to voluntarily take up an equal [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New Era]] we are co-creating, and to collaborate to regenerate and transform our lives, our world, and our way of being within a single generation. 

_All of the levels above happen before any legal structure, and exist purely on the basis of Spiritual resonance and voluntary association, collaboration, culture, social structure, and governance structure. This transcendent understanding of our Divine Right and Responsibility to Self-Organize and Self-Govern as a Tribe of Tribes / Group of Groups / Community of Communities is critical to protecting the Sovereignty and Independence of the Individuals and localities collaborating, while ensuring that there is no overly-centralized node or dependency, that if attacked or compromised, can bring down the Whole. All following and future structural elements are merely tools and supports for the Sovereignties co-operating them_. 

7. From time to time, in the various [[SpatioTemporal Domains]] of this planet and beyond, voluntarily associating members of [[The Lionsberg Alliance]] will instantiate various forms of legal and governance infrastructure to interface with the various existing political systems, and accomplish its various goals.  
8. Drawing on examples such as Mondragon and the United States, these legal instantiations are designed as blended ecosystems / federations of the for-profit and non-profit entities required for each bioregion / locality to flourish.  
9. The primary Legal and Governance Commons that we establish in each Domain are designed to act like "Mother Trees" that can resource and support the emergence of a decentralized array of millions of [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams and Organizations.  
10. To support this emergence, [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] calls for the co-creation of ~100,000 local socioeconomic federations / ecosystems, each serving ~100,000 citizens, and co-operating around [[The Commons]] and the [[New Human Operating System]], enabling ecosystemic resource and knowledge flows across the Federation.  
11. These local ecosystems will self-organize and federate into self-governing [[Bioregions]], which in turn will self-organize and federate into [[Georegions]] and then up into The Whole.  
12. To support the emergence of these federations, [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] calls for reallocating ~2/3 of the $30 Trillion in planned military and defense expenditures during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to instead co-create an interlinked network of [[Lionsberg Instantiation Hubs]]: 
	1. ~12 to 24 [[Georegional Hubs]]
	2. ~150 to 200 [[Bioregional Hubs]]  
	3. ~100,000 [[Local Hubs]]  
	4. ~1,000,000 [[Community Hubs]]    
13. Each fractal hub, commons, organization, and federation will be [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], and will choose its own locally and culturally appropriate legal instances that most faithfully reflect the Vision, Principles, and Values in that specific domain. Each of these will be considered by default a [[Private Ecclesiastical Voluntary Membership Association (PEVMA)]] unless otherwise self-organized.  
14. The diagram below illustrates the configuration of the first legal instantiation / Commons planted in the United States to support the emergence of [[The Federation]]. 
15. This provisional structure was designed and built to enable the first substantial ecosystemic resource flows around the world, through which the full ecosystem will emerge and instantiate itself in all localities that voluntarily so choose during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] and Beyond.   
16. The Community will establish and federate conceptually similar yet culturally-and-contextually-appropriate structures polycentrically around the planet, connected together at the mycelial level to allow for the [[Voluntary Exchange]] of resources, information, and ideas between all fractal levels and localities. 
	1. It is likely that the next three Mother Trees will be incarnated in Europe (Switzerland?), Africa (Kenya?), and South America. 
	2. These next instantiations will be resourced out of the first $10 Million aggregated through the US 501(c)(3). 

This structure is designed to facilitate Emergence, [[Rapid Prototyping]] and  [[Continuous Improvement]].  

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed to enable [[The Whole]] to co-operate as [[One Body]]. The [[Provisional Structure]] is purpose-built to protect the DNA, Processes, and [[Pattern Language]] of the Golden Seed / Divine Blueprints.
