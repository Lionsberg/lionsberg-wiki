# Provisional Structure 

For more information on the inception of the Lionsberg | Meta Project Structure, see [[Background and Context]] in the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery Guide]]. 

Here is a 30 minute introductory discussion:

Core Concepts: 
1. At the deepest level, [[Lionsberg]] and the [[Meta Project]] are reflections of a Spirit /  [[Meta Idea]] we are trying to bring into reality.  
2. One level up from the overarching and uniting [[Meta Idea]] is the voluntary association of individuals around the world working together towards this end.  
3. One level up from individuals are those individuals and organizations Organizing, [[Federating]], Helping One Another, and continuously improving and enriching The Commons of shared tools, resources, and relationships.    
4. The [[Lionsberg Constitution]] and other foundational writings help hold the space for this higher order, multi-generational, covenantal relationship among Citizens of goodwill around the world. 
5. The Lionsberg System has been designed to enable all human beings to voluntarily take up an equal Citizenship in the New Era we are co-creating. 

_All of the levels above happen before any legal structure, and exist purely on the basis of voluntary collaboration, culture, social structure, and governance structure. This is critical to protect the Sovereignty and Independence of the [[Meta Idea]] and the Individuals collaborating, and ensure that there is no Central Node or Dependency, that if attacked or compromised, can bring down the Whole. All structural elements are merely tools and supports for the Sovereignties co-operating them_. 

6. From time to time, in various domains, [[Lionsberg]] will need to instantiate various forms of legal infrastructure to interface with the various existing systems around the world, and accomplish its various goals.  
7. Drawing on examples such as Mondragon and the United States, these legal instantiations will be blended ecosystems / federations of all the for-profit and non-profit entities required for a given bioregion / locality to flourish, interlinked around the world to enable ecosystemic resource and knowledge flows. 
8. The diagram below illustrates the configuration of the first set of legal instantiations. The core infrastructure elements are already in existence. These include the red boxes (related to the non-profit) and the dark blue boxes (related to for-profit entities stewarded In Common).  
9. The Community will need to establish and federate conceptually similar structures polycentrically around the world, and connect those structures together at the mycelial level to allow for the free exchange of resources and information. 
10. It is anticipated that there may ultimately be 12 to 24 Regional Hubs, that in turn support a decentralized array of hundreds of self-sustaining bioregional hubs, that in turn support tens of thousands of localities, and approximately 1 million communities of ~10,000 Citizens each that embrace the Whole of the human family. 

This is a starting point and [[Prototype]] for [[Continuous Improvement]].  

The [[Lionsberg System]] is designed to work as a Whole - as One Body. This structure is purpose-built to protect the DNA, Processes, and [[Pattern Language]] of the Golden Seed that spreads around the world and brings our shared Intention into Reality.
