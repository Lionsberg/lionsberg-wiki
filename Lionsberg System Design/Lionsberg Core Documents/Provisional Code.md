## The Lionsberg | Meta Code
The Question that leads to the articulation of the Code / Way of Being is something like: What would the Spirit of That Which Creates, Sustains, and Enlightens Life and Consciousness _Do_? How would It show up in our Time and Place? How would It Be [[Here]] and [[Now]]? How would It Act [[Here]] and [[Now]]? What would It Do?  

Because Values are abstract, and we have difficulty translating them into the concrete behaviors and Patterns of Thought, Speech, and Action that cause them to manifest, humanity has discovered that it is (at least initially) necessary to translate our shared Values into an explicit [[Behavioral Code]]. 

The Code articulates, in concrete and relatable ways, how the Values show up in our [[Way of Being]] and our [[Way of Doing]]. 

From the One Spirit behind the list of Universal Values above, we have articulated a Code composed of 100 concrete behaviors that, to our [[Current Best Understanding]], consitute an approximation of some of the basic [[Patterns of Life]]. 

It is called the Lionsberg | Meta Code to different our articulation of it from the Absolute / Eternal / Universal / Transcendent understanding of It that cannot be reduced to words. 

This Meta Code is only a shallow and surficial articulation of the Spirit that impells us to do our best to act perfectly, wisely, and rightly in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Nevertheless, recognizing the need to forge a basis for continuously improving our articulation and embodiment of it, we establish the following as a [[Starting Point]] and approximation:

## A Return to Simplicity 
The [[Meta Code]] can be described in One word like One or Love. 

In can be described in Five words like Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom. 

It can be described in 100 concrete behaviors that are likely to manifest from it. 

Or it can be described in 1,000 things that one should do, and 1,000 things that one should not do, in 1,000 different situations. 

For this reason, the Way must be understood and applied in Spirit, not Word. 

If you do not resonate with the Code above, develop your own! And try to make it a little better every day.  

One can never discover the Way through intellectual learning. To know the Way, one must live it and discover it experientially by learning how to allow the Spirit of It to flow through them spontaneously and accurately into whatever time, place, or situation they find themselves in.
