# Provisional Declaration
This is a living document that is a [[Work In Progress]]. 

**CONTEXT**

In our quest towards a better future, humanity and life on earth are facing an unprecedented complex of challenges and opportunities.

We are confronted by:

1.    A total set of challenges to solve  

2.    A total set of goals to accomplish  

3.    A mutual desire and ethical imperative to forge the best possible future for All  

**IMPERATIVE**

These imperatives call for creative and coordinated action at unprecedented scale.  

**CHALLENGES**

Yet at the very moment when we most need to work together, emergent solutions are hindered and society is inflamed by polarization, division, and unnecessary competition between us.  

This division and dysfunction is exacerbated by those abusing the positions and power with which we have entrusted them.  

**ACCELERATION**

These threats to our future loom ever larger as new tools and technology are leveraged to accelerate us along the wrong trajectories.  

**EPIPHANY**

What got us to this point is insufficient to get us to where we want to go.  

**GENERAL SOLUTION**

This demands the emergence of something massive, positive, and good that inspires the hope and courage that cause people to rise. 

The only force on earth capable of meeting this moment in history is a higher order and more perfect union among all people of goodwill. 

This functional unity must be forged such that it is actually capable of meeting the needs, accomplishing the goals, and solving the problems we face.

**THE CHASM**

While millions of people around the world recognize these realities, there is a gap between what ought to be, and what is.

**SPECIFIC SOLUTION**

We are coming together to inspire a global community community of goodwill to design and build itself, so that together we can design and build a better world. 

**Purpose**: The Lionsberg | Meta Project is a working prototype designed to bring our highest shared intention into reality.

**Intention**: Our intention is to create a place, system, and structure where we can work together towards the One Thing that unites us All. 

**Goal**: Our Goal is the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life.

**Process**: Our process is the use of Integrated Delivery to bring the total nested hierarchy of goals into reality. 

**Mission**: Our mission is to serve, connect and empower individuals, organizations, and communities around the world. 

**Vision**: Our vision is a thriving and abundant world in which every being has the opportunity to develop into the fullness of their potential. It is a flourishing world that is becoming more perfect every day because we are working together to make it so. 

**Values**: We stand firmly upon the timeless shared values held by all people of goodwill, including Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom, and upon the Source and Sustainer from which they are our life are derived.
