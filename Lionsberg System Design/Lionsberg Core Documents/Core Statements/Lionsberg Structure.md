# Lionsberg Structure

Lionsberg is structured as a transcendent, self-governing voluntary association of individuals of Goodwill. 

Its participants incarnate and federate appropriate structures in each time and place as necessary to [[Progress]] along the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The first structure was the [[Provisional Structure]] instantiated in the United States to enable hybrid ecosystemic resource flows.
