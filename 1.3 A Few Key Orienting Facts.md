# 1.3 A Few Key Orienting Facts

**All Circles are Self-Resourcing**: To ensure freedom, sovereignty, and autonomy, all Circles must be self-resourcing. There is no central pool of resources to draw on, unless the Players of The Game decide to co-create one. In the Lionsberg System, **capital is viewed as a subordinated tool** that we use when and as necessary to create [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. This is crucial to preserving our freedom. With that freedom comes the responsibility to continue discovering creative ways of individually and collectively resourcing our [[Seasonal Quests]], and **[[The Movement]]** as a Whole. 

**Circles are Self-Governing**: The freedom of life [[Beyond The Boundary]] comes with the responsibility and authority for self-governance at every fractal level, from the individual, to the circle, to the local, to the tribe, to the bioregion, to the planet, and all the Way up to the broadest cosmic Whole. [[Holofractal Sovereignty]] is a core principle of The Great Game.  

**Circles are self-sustaining**: Every self-governing fractal level must also become self-sustaining. Unlike the [[Old World]] of employee-consumer-slavery, out here we are all responsible for our own flourishing, and for the flourishing of [[All]] those around us. Each individual, team, and locality is responsible for their own resourcing and self-sustenance. Since we all need support and no one has everything they need, the emergent co-creation of [[Ecosystemic Resource Flows]] is crucial. 

**Circles are self-replicating**: On the epic Quest towards Destiny, ***none of us can reach [[The Goal]] unless and until all of us reach [[The Goal]]***. This means that the core function of every Circle is to flourish, self-replicate, and help new groups emerge and self-replicate. We monitor self-replication and growth via the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]]. Remember, our near term target is to connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]] by 2026 on the Way towards moving the entire population to the [[New World]] within the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]].  

**Lionsberg is a True Myth**: Lionsberg is an incarnation of the archetypical story about We The People of any planet, who in a moment of [[Meta Crisis]], arose and united to confront and overcome the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, and co-create [[Heaven On Earth]]. It is a myth, but it is True, because we are causing it to be so.
