# Security

The value of security represents a commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals and communities, and to creating an environment that is free from fear and harm. This includes both physical and emotional safety, and can be achieved through a combination of measures such as laws, policies, practices, and infrastructure. It also involves creating a culture of trust and respect, and addressing the root causes of conflict and violence.
