# Default Trajectory

Everything in Universe is in Motion, and has a Trajectory. 

The **Default Trajectory** refers to the path a System, Object, or Entity will travel along if it is not acted upon by a Force. 

In the context of [[Lionsberg]], the notion is often used in association with the [[Meta Crisis]] to help humanity understand that they are collectively on a path towards ruin, and that Failure / [[Collapse]] is the Default Outcome if no conscious and wise [[Intervention]] is individually, locally, and collectively undertaken.
