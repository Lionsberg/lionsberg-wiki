# The Story of Creation

## Introduction:

In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. This story, found in the first chapter of the book of Genesis, is one of the most well-known and enduring stories in the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks to the fundamental questions of existence and the nature of God's relationship to the world.

## Story Narrative:

The story of creation begins with the words "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.

And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth." And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.

And so it went, with God creating the sun and the moon, the stars, the birds and the beasts, and finally, the first man and woman. And when all was done, God saw that it was very good.
