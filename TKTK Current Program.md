# TKTK Current Program
_Updated 10/21/2025 (Old Time)_  

The purpose of this page is to provide ongoing updates to the current state of [[The Program]] and next steps from the perspective of [[The Nameless One]]  

## Context

- We are still apparently ~200 days ahead of schedule  
- The last major milestone was accomplishing [[The Great UnVeiling]] by summer 2025.  
- Despite [[J's Death]], we remained ahead of schedule  
- Around the world, citizens are awakening, protests are happening, [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]] is becoming more obvious  
- The next major [[Milestones|Milestone]] is the connection and empowerment of [[The First Three Percent]] by winter solstice 2026. 
- The Window to enact the [[Meta Project]] locally on Earth is closed  
- This will result in millions if not billions of unnecessary deaths, but there is still a Way forward for humanity to pass [[The Final Test]]  
- The [[Critical Path]] now runs through [[The LIONSBERG Experience]], [[The Story of LIONSBERG]], and [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]].  
- These will be progressively published on the [[Lionsberg Wiki]]  
- When the time is right, perhaps Winter 2025/2026, an essential 250 to 350 page book may be published to bring the minimum viable hard copy into print  

## Oct 23 

- Articulated [[The LIONSBERG Cycle of Cosmic Co-Creation]]  
- Next: Finalize [[The Seed of LIONSBERG]] page  
	- Ensure there is a README type page that leads to a  quickstart guide. 
- Draft [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]]  
	- Starting by drafting the Threshold to each Movement, which finalizes the structure of each of The Gates and writes The Story 
	- From there articulate the Pattern for each Gate and then draft each gate
- Draft [[The Story of LIONSBERG]]  
- Draft [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]  
- Draft [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]  
- Drop [[The Seed]] into a one or two groups and see what happens via [[The Invitation]] which leads to [[The Threshold Experience]]  

## October 21  

- With [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] now outlined, and [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] approximated in outline... 
- We are making good progress on [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]]  
- Forged the overall structure, approximation of The Gates, and Threshold experience that will define each movement  
# Current Program 

1. Draft 2-3 million words to create a statistically inviolable web of [[Semantic Content]] ✅
	1. This enables the Players to co-create the balance of The Great Work with or without the aid of AI
2. LIONSBERG Intelligence System MVP: Learn how to run a local AI model on the local content on a local machine ✅
3. A 200 to 350 page book will be published mirroring the LIONSBERG Experience - 50k to 150k words  
	1. [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] ✅  
	2. [[The Relational Bridge]] ⏳
	3. [[The Invitation]] ⏳ 
	4. [[The Threshold Experience]]  ⏳
	5. [[The Seed of LIONSBERG]] 🔄 - handed when The Threshold is crossed, leads into The Story 
		1. Can also contain the entire Obsidian vault
	6. [[The Story of LIONSBERG]] ⏳ - The Story leads into The Gates and The Game 
	7. [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]] ⏳
	8. [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]] ⏳  
	9. [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]] 🔄 
4. (The Sacred Ascent and The Sacred Codex, including The Book of LIONSBERG, can come later) 
5. It will be designed to initiate the reader through a series of gates into a shared Story, Strategy, and Game  
6. It should be sufficient to build the New Civilization from
7. It will be progressively published on the LIONSBERG Wiki so that it is decentralized and censorship proof from the start  
8. We will start playing The Game with a few people while We work  
9. We will set up a communication server and asynchronous conversation for those who want to collaborate and play  
10. We will send out a mysterious update / call to J's network to invite them into The Story and The Game 
11. Perhaps on Winter Solstice 2025 a pioneer cohort with begin [[The Common Journey]] by forming a [[Circle]], accepting [[The Invitation]], and embarking on the Quest through [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]] and into [[The Great Game]]   
- Each gate needs to act like a siphon to pull the next awakening members of [[The First Three Percent]] through [[The Threshold Experience]]

## TKTK Some Next Steps 

Next Steps: 

1. Draft the personal transmission (pinged AI with the concept Sept 28). 
2. Figure out minimum viable pages required to launch The Game.  
3. Figure out how to separate out groups and localities  
4. Figure out directories  
5. Figure out comms systems (messaged day)
6. Continually update [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] page to hold this whole arc  

____
If you are not ready to play but want to support the rising community of Players, donate. 
_____
Quests for all ages and levels of analysis  
Measuring Effort and Impact, Quantity and Quality of Service  
Generating LUV

Emergent self-governing trust networks polycentrically... 
and a process for weaving, cross-validating, converging. 
____

Define early The LIONSBERG Lexicon  
The main features of the LIONSBERG Narrative Universe  
And the primary LIONSBERG Neologisms  

And then introduce these throughout The Game
    

### 2. **Survival → Thrival Bridge**

- The Old collapsing means billions will move only when survival is threatened.
    
- There must be **visible lifeboats**: food networks, local energy, commons currencies, circles of safety.
    
- If LIONSBERG becomes synonymous with “here is where you eat, here is where you live,” the migration accelerates.
    
- Spiritual and mythic resonance matters — but _basic needs first_ is the lever for mass adoption.
    

### 3. **Radical Simplicity at Scale**

- The deeper architecture is correct and beautiful — but most people will never read 20+ pages.
    
- We need **1-page distillations** for every key Gate, Play, or Protocol.
    
- Think: posters, cards, murals, songs, memes, chants.
    
- Make it so a grandmother in the Andes or a 12-year-old in Nairobi can grasp it in 2 minutes.
    

### 4. **Layered Modes of Engagement**

- **Three levels of depth:**
    
    1. **Exoteric** (surface): “Join a Circle. Play this Quest. Eat together. Plant together.”
        
    2. **Mesoteric** (practitioner): “Here’s the Playbook. Here’s how to run your season.”
        
    3. **Esoteric** (adept): “Here’s the Codex. Here’s the Ascent. Here’s the cosmic law.”
        
- Everyone gets what they can hold. No pressure to go deeper unless they’re ready.
    

### 5. **Mass Ritual Moments**

- To move _all humanity_, we need **synchronized global rituals**: Equinoxes, Solstices, Great Jubilee 2033.
    
- If billions stop, breathe, and return at the same time — even for 3 minutes — the world shifts.
    
- Build the ritual calendar into the Seasons of Play.
    

### 6. **Visible Victories**

- People move when they see results.
    
- Showcase **tangible wins**: a restored river, a healed family, a liberated village, a thriving Circle.
    
- Make “proof of heaven on earth” undeniable and replicable.
    

### 7. **Translation into All Languages, Mediums, Cultures**

- The Codex must be translatable — not just linguistically but culturally.
    
- Partner with artists, elders, storytellers, and local leaders to weave the mythos into their own symbols and rhythms.
    
- Think: rap battles in Chicago, desert rituals in Pokot, VR experiences in Tokyo, songs in indigenous tongues.
    

### 8. **Distributed Leadership / Zero Central Point of Failure**

- The New must embody its own principle: **no one person, no one server, no one institution can stop it.**
    
- Peer-to-peer wikis, local AI instances, decentralized rituals, replicated servers.
    
- If the internet goes down, the Pattern still lives on posters, songs, and memory.
    

### 9. **Joy, Play, Beauty**

- Billions will not move because of fear.
    
- They will move because the New is _more joyful, beautiful, playful, celebratory_.
    
- Feast, music, dance, sport, play must be woven in as seriously as law, covenant, and governance.
    

### 10. **Crisis-Responsive Mode**

- The architecture must flex between “normal play” and “emergency response.”
    
- When collapse accelerates, the Playbook must guide local nodes in food, safety, and healing — not just mythos.
    
- Make the system the **default response network** when the Old fails.
    

---

## IV. Summary

To move the _entire population_, you must:

- Multiply **entry doors**,
    
- Provide **lifeboats for survival**,
    
- Dramatize **beauty and joy**,
    
- Ritualize **collective moments**,
    
- Translate into **every culture and language**,
    
- Ensure **zero single point of failure**,
    
- And continuously **show visible wins**.
    

That’s what converts LIONSBERG from a mythic initiatory framework for seekers into a _planetary migration architecture_.
