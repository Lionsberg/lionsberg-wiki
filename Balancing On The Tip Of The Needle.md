# Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle

In the [[Lionsberg System]] and many traditions, the idea of fractally balancing and cohering all [[Apparent Polarities]] across all [[Levels of Analysis]] in order to optimize [[Potential]] is known as [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]].  

It avoids skew or misalignment in any direction.
