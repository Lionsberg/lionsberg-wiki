- Set up [[Groups]], [[Teams]], and  [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]]  
- Understand [[Team of Teams]]   
- Set [[SMART Goals]]
- Understand the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] that contains the project or puzzle piece you are working on.
- Understand the sequence of [[Milestones]] and [[Tasks]] required to accomplish the [[Goals]]. 
- Set realistic timeframes  
- Create a [[Work Breakdown Structure]] 
- Create a [[Project Plan]]
- Hold short, regular, frequent check-ins to [[Solve Issues]] and iterate the [[Project Plan]].
- Hold [[Retrospective|Retrospectives]] at the mid-point and end of the Project  
- Experienced, well-oiled teams require less strict project management hygiene. The close you get to Mastery, the more you can [[Break The Rules In Order To Do What Is Right]]. 
- New, less-organized, or heterogenous teams require more careful attention to Project Management Hygiene to [[Avoid Failure]] and [[Achieve Success]].
