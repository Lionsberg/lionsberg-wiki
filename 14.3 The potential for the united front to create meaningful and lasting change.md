# 14.3 The potential for the united front to create meaningful and lasting change

The united front has the potential to create meaningful and lasting change by bringing together individuals and organizations from diverse backgrounds and sectors to work towards a common goal and vision. The diversity and collaboration within the united front allows for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the Meta Crisis, as well as a greater ability to adapt and respond to changing circumstances.

One of the key strengths of the united front is its ability to mobilize and coordinate collective action. The united front leverages the Lionsberg System and is thereby able to act as a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and collective action, connecting individuals and organizations working on similar issues and facilitating the sharing of knowledge, resources, and expertise. This allows for the development, implementation, and cross-pollination of solutions that are effective, efficient, and regenerative.

The united front also promotes a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This is done through the sharing of wisdom, ideas, innovations, and lessons learned among members, as well as through the use of data and evidence to inform decision-making and continuously improve solutions. This ability to learn and adapt allows the united front to respond to the changing needs of individuals and communities, and to the changing conditions of the world.

The united front is also designed to be citizen led, diverse and just, ensuring that the needs and perspectives of all members of society are taken into account. It promotes diversity and justice by actively seeking out and engaging individuals and organizations from marginalized and underrepresented communities.

The united front also has the potential to create meaningful and lasting change at the global level. It has the ability to influence policy and decision-making at the local, national, and international levels, and to shape the policies and regulations that will have a significant impact on the Meta Crisis.

In summary, the united front has the potential to create meaningful and lasting change by bringing together individuals and organizations from diverse backgrounds to work towards a common goal, promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement, and being citizen led and just. Its ability to mobilize and coordinate collective action via the Lionsberg System, as well as its potential to influence policy and decision-making, give it the ability to create meaningful and lasting change at the local, national and global levels.
