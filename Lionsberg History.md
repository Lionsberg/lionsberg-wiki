## Current State August 2022
As we began the third 6 week cycle in August 2022, the state was as follows: 

- The [[Provisional Structure]] was in place. 
- The [[Core Documents]] were in a Provisional State. 
- The Patterns of [[Organize and Federate|Organizing and Federating]] had been established. 
- A few dozen people were actively participating, and several dozen more attending, following along, and waiting.  
- Numerous partnership discussions and expansion opportunities were in play  
- The [[Core Infrastructure]] had advanced far enough to begin creating marketplace and economy  
- It was an entirely voluntary effort of good human beings, advancing in goodwill, towards [[The Goal]]  
- We were working on [[Value Creation]], and learning to notice [[Value]] as it was being created in-stride. 
- We were beginning to formalize presentations of [[Value Creation]] - [[2022.Q2 Presentation of Value Creation]].  
- It felt wobbly. It felt vulnerable. It felt exciting. It felt [[New]]. 
- Some people had grown frustrated or impatient and stepped back. 
- Some people had generated new enthusiasm and stepped forward. 
- We had our first committed and blocked hours to apply to the [[Critical Path]]. 
- We were preparing to establish our first Opportunities, Offers, and Needs Marketplace. 
- We were preparing to engage our first extended Pull Planning session to see ahead into the [[Milestones]] and [[Critical Path]]. 
- We had determined the Core Teams that needed to formalized and structured. 
- We had network nodes representing thousands of incredible people circling, watching, and wondering... 
- [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] was holding space and risk as the sole board member and funding source 
- It was reported that the backbone technological infrastructure we had funded was being leveraged by ~170 impact organizations in ~13 countries  
- Some of the most talented, skilled, and wise people we had ever worked with were surrounding us and investing time, energy, and attention  
- And we were ready to advance into the next round of resourcing, partnership and engagement.
