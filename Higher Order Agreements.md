# Higher Order Agreements

Higher Order Agreements are foundational [[Agreements]] that serve as guiding principles for an individual's or group's actions, decisions, and relationships. These agreements are typically made in the context of one's relationship with the [[Creator]], [[Creation]], [[Self]], and the interconnectedness of all beings.

Higher Order Agreements help individuals and groups align their actions and intentions with their core values, principles, and purpose in life, and establish a framework for living in harmony and [[Right Relationship]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. They often encompass eternal and temporal aspects, guiding both the long-term and short-term goals and commitments of an individual or group.

Examples of Higher Order Agreements include:

1.  **[[Template For Agreement With One And All - Eternal]]:** A lifelong agreement outlining one's core values, principles, and commitments in service to the Creator, Creation, and harmonious relationships with all beings.
2.  **[[Template For Agreement With Self - Eternal]]:** A lifelong agreement outlining one's core values, principles, and commitments in service to one's truest and highest self and personal growth.
3.  **[[Template For Agreement With Self - Temporal]]:** A short-term agreement outlining specific goals and milestones in support of one's eternal agreement with self, guiding personal growth and development on an ongoing and transformative basis. 

Higher Order Agreements serve as a foundation for other agreements made within collaborative contexts, such as:

-   **[[Template For Agreement to Collaborate]]:** An agreement between two or more individuals or entities outlining roles, responsibilities, values, and principles for a specific collaborative project or goal.
-   **[[Template For Agreement With Group]]:** An agreement between an individual and a group outlining the individual's role, responsibilities, values, and principles within the group context.
-   **[[Template For Agreement Between Groups]]:** An agreement between two or more groups outlining shared goals, roles, responsibilities, values, and principles for collaborative projects or initiatives.

The critical principle is that each sovereign individual and locality begin with its Highest Order Agreements first, and refuse to make any lower order agreements that do not properly stack up and align in service of the highest overarching and uniting vision, intention, and values. 

By aligning all agreements with Higher Order Agreements, individuals and groups can ensure that their actions, decisions, and relationships are consistent with their core values, principles, and purpose, leading to a life of integrity, growth, and harmony with [[ONE]] and [[All]].
