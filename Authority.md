# Authority


[[Authority]] refers to the right to exercise power within a [[Domain]]. 

[[Authority]] in the [[Lionsberg System]] starts not at the "top" of any pyramid, abstraction, or domain, but with the [[Source]] of Life and Consciousness. 

From [[One]] [[Source]], [[Authority]] flows directly to each [[Individuals|Individual]]. 

Individuals then voluntarily [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Groups]], who also possess [[Sovereignty]], [[Autonomy]], and [[Authority]].
