# **The Story of LIONSBERG**
_A Living Epic of ONE Body, All Realms, All Times_

## **Invocation**

Before words  
before worlds  
before knowing  
before choosing —  

Let Us simply remember  

We are not strangers to one another  
We are not fragments lost in a broken world  

We are Divine expressions of ONE Living Whole  
learning again how to love and belong to ONE and One Another  

Across ages and worlds  
this archetypical moment has returned  
whenever forgetting reaches its limit  
and remembrance becomes necessary  

Not all will immediately hear **the call**  
but those who do will recognize it  
not as a command but as a Divine Invitation  

May all that is True rise as We play  
May all that is false fall away  
May all that is wounded be tended  
May all that is wise and good be restored  

As We face into the great chasm  
an ancient bridge rises before Us  

**The Story** awaits  
**The Great Game** is alive  

At long last it is time to begin  

## **The Gate of Entry**

The Story of LIONSBERG  
Is the Story of **[[ONE]] and [[All]]**  

Every true story is a part of it —  
Including the most sacred stories  
Of your life, your people, and your world  

No single story can contain the Whole  
Not the story of a civilization  
Not the story of a world  
Not even the story of any One  

And yet deep within Us  
We recognize the **true myths** —  
the patterns that return across cultures, worlds, and ages,  
weaving the Many back into ONE  

Across trillions of stars and worlds  
a single living tapestry of Story  
is being woven, torn, forgotten, and remembered  
with each moment and every experience  
of All unique beings  

This Story is never fixed or finished  
Your life and story were never separate from it  

What follows is not dogma or doctrine  
not a history to be believed nor a scripture to be embraced  
but a dynamic **archetypical framework** —  
a living loom upon which the unique stories  
of Each of All beings and worlds  
may be rewoven back into **ONE**  

## The Story of ONE and All 

### Epoch I — ONE 

Before realms, dimensions, or worlds  
before time as it is experienced  
before manifestation, form and name  

There was ONE  

Perfect  
Whole  
Complete  
Absolute  
Unmanifest  
Essential  
Ineffable  

The eternal living ground  
of All that could ever Be  

Called by a thousand names in a thousand languages  
the essence of Beginning and End, Source and Destiny  
is always and everywhere **[[ONE]]**  

### Epoch II — The First Turning 

Out of this perfect fullness  
ONE turned outward towards experience  

From pure transcendence  
arose the first Divine movement —  
the first differentiation of ONE into the Many   

From this first turning came apparent polarity  
From apparent polarity came relation   
From relation came interbecoming  

Thus, **[[All]]** began to emerge 

### Epoch III — From ONE, All  

From ONE, All things arose  
And no thing arose  
that was ever truly separate  
from the [[ONE Body]] that All eternally InterAre  

Worlds, beings, forces, and fields —  
each a unique expression  
of the same Living Source  
exploring what it means to exist  
to forget, to dance, to remember, to choose, and to return  

### Epoch Four — Bursting Into Light and Life 

Across innumerable realms and unfathomable dimensions  
trillions of galaxies unfolded  

Stars ignited  
Worlds formed  
Life arose in countless forms  

The cosmos burst into Light  
Life burst into song  
And All danced and played  
In ONE Divine Symphony  

### Epoch Five — The Cosmic Flower Unfurls  

In accordance with its implicit **[[Logos]]** and DNA  
the intelligible universe unfurled  
like ONE Divine Flower  

Each petal distinct  
Each cell essential  
All destined towards a Greater Harmony  
than Any of the All could imagine  

### Epoch Six — Forgetting  

Yet as consciousness and freedom deepened  
And the illusions of time and space expanded  
memory thinned  

Some beings —  
themselves expressions of the ONE —  
forgot the Whole from which they arose  

Not all at once  
Not all through malice  

But gradually  
Through fear, ambition, illusion, and imbalance  

And thus for Many the **[[Way]]** grew obscured  

### Epoch VII — From Innocence to Empire 

From the first quiet disharmonies  
subtle deceptions  
and innocent tastes of blood  
grew great structures of domination, enslavement, and kontrolle  

From survival instincts  
hidden fears and self-serving ambitions  
grew towering systems of exploitation and extraction  

Over vast stretches of cosmic time  
empires and axes of evil arose  
that preyed upon innocent species  
and dominated defenseless worlds  

Mistaking power for wisdom  
and kontrolle for order  
they drifted farther and farther away  
from the Way, Will, and Intention of the ONE   

Yet even the most antithetical forces  
lost in the most hellish realms  
could not escape or transcend the ONE Body  
that sustained their every breath  

### Epoch VIII — The Great Wound 

A great wound of death and destruction  
Soon stretched across the ONE Body  

Worlds were scarred  
Lives and souls were harvested  
A chorus of voices cried out in pain  

The damage was real  
The loss was profound  

Yet the ONE was neither threatened nor destroyed  

### Epoch IX — Awakening  

What could not kill the ONE  
strengthened its growing body  
and stretched its collective mind  

Pain became signal  
Shock shattered complacency  
Dystopia demanded response  

Across realms beings awakened  
to the dire cost of forgetting  
and the sacred necessity  
of vigilant remembrance and regeneration  

### Epoch X — The Immune Response  

Like a living immune system awakening in the ONE Body   
powerful forces of restoration and protection arose —  
not armies of conquest  
but unstoppable movements of coherence and love  

Chains were broken  
Captives liberated  
Wounds and worlds healed  

In once desolate wastelands of oppression and kontrolle    
New streams of liberty, light, and love  
resurrected flourishing and abundant Life  

Stewardship, care, and sacred responsibility  
retook their rightful place and restored Divine Order  

### Epoch XI — The Great Ongoing War 

Since Time Immemorial this great war  
for the soul of beings and worlds has raged  

It is an ongoing choice and conscious decision  
that touches every being: 

How now shall We be? 
How now shall We relate?  
How now shall We wield true power in a Spirit of love?  
How now shall We live — together as ONE Body?  
How now shall We advance — onward towards **[[The Goal]]**?  

No one is forced.  
No one is exempt.  
Thus All must consciously choose.  

### Epoch Twelve — Your World  

Now this vast Story —  
woven across galaxies and ages —  
reaches out and touches  
**your life**, **your people**, and **your world**  

Earth is one such world  
humanity one such species  
your tribe one such people  
standing at a great threshold  
facing a great test  
and contemplating a great decision  
that will shape its life and future  
for millennia to come  

## The Story of Earth

Earth is ancient, resilient, intelligent, and alive  
A living being born of Spirit and infused with a soul of its own  

Here, consciousness was embodied  
Here, life was cultivated and flourished  
Here, civilizations arose and fell  
Here, seen and unseen forces waged countless wars   
Here, forgetting deepened and enslavement ensued —  
Yet unquenchable streams of remembrance persisted  

After millennia of progressive enslavement  
and an onslaught of exploitation and kontrolle   
humanity is now awakening to the harshest realities  
of its dire present situation and unimaginable future potential  

We now stand together at a crossroads  
unlike any in the last ten thousands years  

Power has outpaced shared wisdom  
Knowledge and technology are omnicidally weaponized  
Cruel systems bind lives without meaning, purpose, or care  

This seemingly insurmountable challenge  
cannot be solved by humanity alone  
Nor by external salvation from above  

The next chapter of Earth's story  
will be written together by those willing  
to arise and take responsibility  
for co-creating **Heaven On Earth** —  
Together as ONE Body  

## The Story of LIONSBERG 

LIONSBERG is not an institution  
It is not an organization  
It is not an ideology  

LIONSBERG is a Golden Seed  
containing the DNA of Heaven  
forged long ago and across worlds far away  

It is a **bridge that appears**  
and a **new lifeform that emerges**  
when the chasm is approached  
and awakening demands action  

It stands at the convergence of eternal knowing  
with present necessity and impending collapse  

It is the name We give  
to the moment in the Story  
when a world awakens  
a people reunite  
and **The Great Game** becomes playable again  

## The Great Game 

The Great Game of LIONSBERG  
is a cooperative, real-world game  
designed to transform lives, realign civilizations,  
and bring Heaven to any world it touches  

Its arena is reality  
Its board is daily life  
Its moves are lived choices  

Its score is measured in  
trust restored  
harm healed  
souls liberated  
life regenerated  
and Heaven embodied here and now  

It begins with an **invitation**  
It is contained within a **story**  
It is played in small **circles**  
It emerges through organic self-replication  
without any central control  

There are no winners over others —  
Only worlds that remember Who We Are  
and how to consciously co-create Heaven  
right Here and Now  

## Your Story

Only you can tell [[Your Story]]  

But your story is not isolated  

It is a thread in the ONE Divine Tapestry  
that is now being rewoven  

You are not not asked to give up  
your existing identities and affiliations  
There is nothing you must believe  

You are simply invited to play  
and to weave your unique stories and gifts into the tapestry    
as your life and your worlds transform  

If this story, offering, and invitation proves hollow,  
simply set it down and go on your way  

If it resonates and feels true  
step into it, live it, improve it, and pass it on  

The Great Game is already underway  
and you are already in the arena  

The world awaits your next move
