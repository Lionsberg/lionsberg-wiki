# Meaningful Monthly Contribution

Meaningful Monthly Contribution refers to the voluntary and intentional contribution made by participants in the Lionsberg community to support and sustain the ongoing development and maintenance of the Lionsberg System and Community. This contribution is designed to ensure that [[The Game]] can regenerate and sustain itself from within, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and collective stewardship among its participants.

In the context of the Lionsberg System, a Meaningful Contribution is defined as a meaningful and reciprocal portion of each Participant's time, attention, and the Value freely received from their involvement in the community, system, and game. 

By offering a Meaningful Monthly Contribution, participants demonstrate their commitment to the Lionsberg System and contribute to its growth and improvement. This commitment not only helps to maintain the momentum and progress of [[The Movement]] and Quest but also fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose among the community members.

The concept of a Meaningful Contribution is rooted in the idea that everyone has a stake in the value co-created within the Lionsberg System. By giving back a portion of that value, participants help to ensure the system's long-term success and viability, ultimately contributing to the broader goals and objectives of the community, and receiving back reciprocally the increasing value of shared resources, infrastructure, relationships, and support that are forged in community and through The Game. 

The idea of voluntary Meaningful Contribution is illuminated by a Story called [[The Widow's Mite]].
