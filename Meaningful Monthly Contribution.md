# Meaningful Monthly Contribution
*Updated June 26, 2025*

Meaningful Monthly Contribution refers to the voluntary and intentional contribution made by participants in the Lionsberg community to support and sustain the ongoing development and maintenance of the Lionsberg System, Community, and Commons. This contribution is designed to ensure that the Community and Commons can regenerate and sustain themselves from within, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and collective stewardship among members and participants.

The idea of Meaningful Contribution is illuminated by a Story called [[The Widow's Mite]].
