# God

In the [[Lionsberg System]], God is often referred to as [[One]], [[Creator]] or [[Source]] and Sustainer. 

It refers to the [[One]] thing from, through, and to which [[All]] other things arise and return. 

Rather than adopt any existing concretization of the [[Absolute]], the [[Lionsberg System]] intentionally leaves this in the [[Abstract]] so that it stays transcendent of all human ideology, and so that people from many different perspectives and systems of belief can relate to it and wrestle with it eternally.
