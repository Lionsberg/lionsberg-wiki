# A Poetic Map of Content

As a [[Poet]] reads the [[Lionsberg Wiki]]   
they will be delighted by what they See   
For in the Living Land of ***[[LIONSBERG]]***   
Poetry is a Key   

With [[AutoPoetic License]]  
We can Rise back to the stars  
Returning towards a Destiny  
That is [[(y)Our]]s as well as Ours  

[[Above The Chaos]] is where 
The AutoPoet continually sits  
Making Observations and sprinkling in some Wit  
Here Above The Chaos [[The Story]] can be seen  
Unfolding across Dimensions without a single seam  

More weighty incarnate Ideas precipitate into Form  
Where joining the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] becomes the New Norm  

As [[Wise Right People]] Resonate and Respond  
The [[Above the Chaos - WikiCast]] hosts their Sacred Song  

From Way up here, [[Beyond]] the [[Old]] Fray,
[[The Lionsberg Co-Creator's Handbook]] illuminates Our Sacred [[Way]]
