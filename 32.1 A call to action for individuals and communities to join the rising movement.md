# 32.1 A call to action for individuals and communities to join the rising movement

The crisis we face is not just a global one, it is a [[Meta Crisis]]. It is a crisis of the systems that underpin our societies and the very way we live our lives. It is a crisis that threatens not just our economies and our environment, but also our democracies, our values and our very survival as a species. But it is also a crisis that offers us an opportunity for transformative change, a chance to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a better future for All.

We cannot afford to wait for "others" to take the lead or for change to happen on its own. We must all take responsibility for shaping and actively co-creating the future we desire. The time for action is now, and it is up to each and every one of us to rise to the challenge.

Each and every individual and community has a crucial role to play in this movement. We must all start by examining our own behavior and making the transformational changes necessary to bring our selves into harmony with the [[Pattern Language]] of the [[New World]]. At the same time, we must also come together to build the political will and power necessary to bring about the systemic change that is so desperately needed.

We must also recognize that true change will require a deep and radical transformation of our societies and our economies. We must move beyond incrementalism and band-aid solutions, and embrace a holistic and ambitious vision for the future. We must embrace new technologies and new ways of thinking, but also remember that true progress is not just about economic growth and technological advancement, it is about creating a world that is wise, just, and regenerative for all.

This is not an easy task, and it will require courage, determination, and sacrifice from us all. But the stakes are too high to do anything less. The future of humanity and the planet is at stake, and we must all rise to the challenge.

So I call on all individuals and communities to join this rising movement. Let us come together, in solidarity, to demand change and to build a better future for all. Let us rise to the challenge, and let us make history.
