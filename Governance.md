# Governance

The word “Govern” derives from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. It begs the question: 

_How do we collectively navigate our Vessel towards The Goal?_  

Having fixed our [[Aim]], how do we get from [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]? 

The Lionsberg System was created as an answer to this question.
