# Governance

The word “Govern” derives from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. It begs the question: 

_How do we [[Individually And Collectively]] navigate our Vessel(s) towards [[The Goal]]?_  

Having fixed our [[Aim]], how do we get from [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]? 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] was created as an answer to this question.
