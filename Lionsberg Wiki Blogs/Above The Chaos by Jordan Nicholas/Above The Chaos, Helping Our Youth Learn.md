# Helping Our Youth Learn

A post in [[Above The Chaos By Jordan Nicholas]].

We have been working with a few organizations who are passionate about how we raise up the rising generations. 

I do not know what the right answer is, but here is my hypothesis: 

1. It is possible for _every_ child born today to have a better education than _any_ person has ever had in the past. 
2. In order for that to occur, we are going to have to [[Transform Our Paradigm]] FROM educating children TO helping people learn. 
3. Helping people learn should be a lifelong [[Process]].
4. This lifelong process should be rooted in the development and transformation of the whole being - spiritually, intellectually, and physically. 
5. The [[Purpose]] of this lifelong development of the Whole being is to help each individual discover and realize their unique potential while helping All others realize theirs.
