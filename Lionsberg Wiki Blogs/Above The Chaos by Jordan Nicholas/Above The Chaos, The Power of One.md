# Above The Chaos,  The Power of One

A post in [[Above The Chaos By Jordan Nicholas]].

Hello Friends and Allies, 

On numerous occasions, my Life and Being have been radically transformed by the Power of One. 

Let me explain. 

Despite having a profound Spiritual experience and calling from waking moments of consciousness, I have also plunged myself into years of unconscious engagement in a broken society and economy, and lost the true experiential intimacy with the Ultimate Reality of [[What Matters]] most. 

These periods have inevitably led to foolish decisons from lower places of consciousness, relationship damage from the "smallness" of Being I was manifesting, and unnecessary confusion, strain, and suffering in my Life and Relationships. 

Sometimes these holes can feel profoundly lonely. Lost. Mired in Chaos of our own creation. Suffering because of our own failures and inadequacies. Separated from the depths of purpose and meaning. Battling hopelessness. Unsure how we can Forgive or Be Forgiven as a result of the damage that has been done. 

In each case, it has been the Power of One that has lifted me up out of the depths of Chaos and Confusion, and set my feet back on the Rock. 

As our lives and our world have been shaken the last couple years, I find myself coming across more and more people who feel lost, confused, and unsure. As the leaders and structures we might have turned to for hope and guidance in the past have revealed themselves to be corrupt and lacking, we can feel isolated and alone. 

If it would be useful for anyone, I will make myself available over the coming 6 weeks for an experiment. 

During the experiement, I will do my best to share with you a [[Way]] in which, using just **One Hour a Day**, one can ascend up out of the depths of the underworld, rise above the Chaos, and rediscover the fullness of meaning, purpose, and connection. 

My commitment to you is as follows: 

1. I will spend at least 1 hour a day engaging in this process alongside side you and praying for you. We will be in this work together  
2. Beyond the 1 hour a day, I will strive to actually live this Way for as much of each day as I can  
3. I will host a 75 minute weekly meeting in which we can share our experiences   
4. I will do my best to listen to the needs and issues of the group, and help the group forge solutions that help one another  
5. I will listen and speak to you as Truthfully and Deeply as I can  
6. I will set up a technology space in which we can connect and share our experience and stories  

Our commitment to each other: 

1. We will spend 1 hour a day engaging the process  
2. We will attend at least 5 of the 6 weekly meetings  
3. We will do our best to listen to One Another's needs, and help One Another 
4. If we discover that the experiment elevates and transforms our lives and our world in a meaningful and valuable Way, we will work together to expand the experiment. 

My time: I offer up my Life as a free gift that you can engage with if it is helpful and meaningful. 

Value Reciprocity: Each [[Participant]] will contribute an amount weekly to a [[Power of One Fund]] hosted by the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) public charity. The amount of the contribution should reflect the value of the experience / experiment to you, and your desire to see it expanded to serve others. 

If, after the 6 week experiment, we decide to expand it, the accumulated resources will be transparently used to improve or expand the Program in accordance with a strategic plan we will develop together. 

If, after the 6 week experiment, we decide to end it, the donations will be merged into the Lionsberg General Fund.
