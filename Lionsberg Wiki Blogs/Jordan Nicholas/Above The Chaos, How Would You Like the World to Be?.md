# Above The Chaos, How Would You Like the World to Be? 

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.01.29 _(updated 2024.01.29)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

I have been having wonderful conversations with Greg Flint, author of the children's book [How The World Got Better](https://www.amazon.com/How-World-Better-Greg-Flint/dp/B0B8R8RBSX). You can hear Greg read the story on [Public Radio Exchange](https://beta.prx.org/stories/362373) (~25 minutes). 

Around the fire one night in the not-so-distant future, a lovely old couple tells their precocious great-granddaughter what happened when the people of the world finally answered ***one magical question***.  

Warm, wise, and right on time, How the World Got Better calls to the hero in each of us to answer that same simple question:

**“How would you LIKE this world to be?”**

None of us like the way things are going. We all know that [[What Got Us Here Will Not Get Us To Where We Want To Go]]. One of the first steps towards change is to Imagine something [[Better]]. 

Greg and I would like to invite you into our ongoing conversation.

From Greg: 

*Ourself or our world, it gets Better as we begin to believe it can and act like it...*

*...this is the key to it all. We can only Believe what we can first Imagine.*

*So let's Image it!* 

*Let us hear each ohter answer, bravely and from the heart, one little question it seems we've never considered:*

***HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THIS WORLD TO BE?***

*Please, just imagine it, bravely and from the heart... speak it, write it, sign it, share it...*

*What if we the listen to each other, all the world around, starting with the kids?*

*What if, one what's important, we find agreement enough to finally* ***believe*** *our world can get better? So we act like it, and so it does... What if?*
