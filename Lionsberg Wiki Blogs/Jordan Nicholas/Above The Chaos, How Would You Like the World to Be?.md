# Above The Chaos, How Would You Like the World to Be?

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

I have been having wonderful conversations with Greg Flint, author of the children's book [How The World Got Better](https://www.amazon.com/How-World-Better-Greg-Flint/dp/B0B8R8RBSX). You can hear Greg read the story on [Public Radio Exchange](https://beta.prx.org/stories/362373) (~25 minutes). 

Around the fire one night in the not-so-distant future, a lovely old couple tells their precocious great-granddaughter what happened when the people of the world finally answered ***one magical question***.  

Warm, wise, and right on time, How the World Got Better calls to the hero in each of us to answer that same simple question:

**“How would you LIKE this world to be?”**

None of us like the way things are going. We all know that [[What Got Us Here Will Not Get Us To Where We Want To Go]]. One of the first steps towards change is to Imagine something [[Better]]. 

Greg and I would like to invite you into our ongoing conversation. To join us, simply: 

1. Answer [The Question](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z9dLB9XQI3k6G7BVfenGELL76fVeFsMgkYrQg4O2NY0/edit) on the survey and view responses from others  
2. Share the link to this page, and invite your network to answer The Question  

If you put your email address into the form, I will do my best to keep you up to date on our efforts to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a [[Better World]].
