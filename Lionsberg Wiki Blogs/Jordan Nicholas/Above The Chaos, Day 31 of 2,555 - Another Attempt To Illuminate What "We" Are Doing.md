# Above The Chaos, Day 31 of 2,555 - Another Attempt To Illuminate What "We" Are Doing

Esteemed Friend,  

We can all see different shades of the Whole. 

From my vantage point, humanity is entering the opening stages of a Meta Crisis that will entirely realign life and society as we think we know it, for better or worse. 

It is not a choice to not decide and "see what happens." Deciding not to decide is a concrete decision to trust the outcome to the humans are making concrete decisions and shaping reality. Deciding not to decide is a concrete decision to accept the default outcome based on current systems and forces. 

There could not possibly be a more foolish strategy than to leave the outcome to the  existing systems and forces governing, oppressing, and exploiting our world. 

Every citizen of earth has a concrete and affirmative duty to [[Consciously Decide]] which futures, out of the infinite array of possible futures, meet their [[Acceptance Criteria]]. 

Perhaps, in the face of such a Meta Crisis, every citizen of earth also has a concrete and affirmative moral duty to work together towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

**We are speaking into existence a [[Citizen Led]] effort to awaken, arise, and unite to meet this moment in history.** 

Why [[Citizen Led]]? Because we are All citizens of Earth. Unless we are going to make the decision to sacrifice our right and responsibility to govern our selves and our planet to "them", it is up to "us" to navigate and land society and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the better Future we All seek. In a wise, competent, forthright Way. 

The existing Old systems of "governance" and "economy" are proving themselves to be entirely inadequate and far too corrupted to meet this moment in history in a remotely competent or acceptable way. 

From the perspective of TIME, the pattern watchers understand the window of opportunity is short until larger dislocations and disconnections take place. Over the next 7 to 10 years, everything is going to change. The system of systems will transform. 

There are three likely outcomes from such a phase change in the system of systems. 

The first is a collapse towards chaos and anarchy. The second is a tightening of authoritarian / totalitarian control. 

The third is a great leap forward into a higher order functional unity that retains all the best features and benefits of the Old Systems, while ushering powerful New capabilities, features, and benefits. This is a brilliant possibility, but it is *not* the automatic or default outcome. It must be consciously chosen and accomplished. 

Because the current order IS failing, and neither chaos, anarchy, nor totalitarian control are acceptable, and because there is no "them" that we can trust to forge the New System out of the ashes of the Old... 

**It is up to "us". And "we" must make that "us" large enough until it encompasses, represents, and serves All, equally and without exception.** 

Therefore, we, the citizens of Earth, are launching a Citizen Led Response to the Meta Crisis, through which over the coming 7 years, of our own free will and initiative, we will voluntarily design, build and adopt a New and Higher Order System to transcend and replace the failing Old Systems of the Old World. 

Further, we will do this at such a rapid rate that we will have designed, embraced, and implemented the New *prior to the failure of the Old*, and *also* before the corrupt, unjust, and exploitative forces governing the Old World can implement "their" further corrupted and strengthened new order. 

Assuming a *non-zero probability* of a progressive collapse, aided by those striving towards this end, over the coming 7 to 10 years... 

...we, the free citizens of Earth, have approximately **ZERO TIME** to organize our selves, in order to accomplish as much progress over the next 1 to 2 years, before strategic disruptions to our technology, communications, and coordinative abilities begin to occur. 

What is absolutely required, regardless of its audacity, complexity, or perceived impossibility, is an absolutely-unparalleled-in-human-history universal Apollo program through which **over the coming 7 years we work together to vanquish the Meta Crisis and land humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the future we all desire.** 

We have all worked for lifetimes to lay the foundations for this moment. We have built the systems. We have built the technology. We have built the infrastructure. Now all that we need to do is decide. I have decided, and I have sacrificed everything to prepare. What is your decision? 

If we were going to take this *at least* as seriously as we took the Manhattan Project or the Apollo Program, because far more is at stake, we would be assembling the first $100M or $1 Billion in financial resources, along with the systems, facilities, tools, technologies, and infrastructure required for an absolutely world class team of citizens of Earth to be working together with 100% focus towards The Goal. 

We, the citizens of Earth, can do anything we want to do within the boundaries of the Living System and the Universal Law. After all, it is OUR WORLD. 

If you are with us, meet us @Lionsberg. 

Much Love,
