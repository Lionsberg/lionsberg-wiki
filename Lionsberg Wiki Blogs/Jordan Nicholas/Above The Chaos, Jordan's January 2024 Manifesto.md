# Above The Chaos, Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto

Greetings loved ones and allies, 

As another year in the epic story of the human species aboard planet Earth slips into history, it is more evident than ever that despite our best efforts and progress to date, what got us here will not carry us forward to the Better Future we all desire. 

My current best understanding is that there is a significant nonzero probability that the current order is on the brink of a disorderly collapse. Our house divided against itself will not stand. And it is not obvious that what might arise to take the place of the failing post-WWII American Order will better. It is clear that forces of malevolence are consciously accelerating events towards that end. 

The simple solution is Unity Under God. To arise, unite, Seek First The Kingdom of God, and forthrightly wage the war for the future of our civilization. I remain prepared to give my life towards this End. 

This involves reuniting as One Citizenship Under God and assembling an unprecedented global Force For Good to vanquish corruption and injustice, solve the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, and forge the Best Possible Future for All. 

This Body would be assembled from the bottom up on the basis of voluntary consent, with individuals and small-groups coming together to form a self-sustaining, self-replicating, and self-governing new polity.  

Over the last 7 years, we have curated together tens of millions of dollars of value, laid the groundwork and built the systems and technology to enable such an unprecedented Citizen Led response to the present [[Meta Crisis]]. It will require a tremendous amount of training, discipline, and practice. However it must be done. 

To start the year, I spent some time alone in the mountains and recorded three fireside chats: 

1. The State of Our World - [Fireside Chat 1 - The State of Our World](https://youtu.be/UFLKfZlGi08?si=ataOdvzSScwB_ate)
2. The Probability of Collapse - [Fireside Chat 2 - On Collapse](https://youtu.be/mR6YMzWRlt8?si=8-A_8YkyFinqgl39)
3. A Positive Vision, Strategy and Plan to forge the Best Possible Future - [Fireside Chat 3 - A Vision, Strategy, and Plan](https://youtu.be/DAcg7AV0RJg?si=6FZlrKswfHqOl9mk)

Additionally, over the last few years I developed a series of interlinked writings that explore the [[Meta Crisis]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]] from a variety of angles - see the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] and the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]]. 

And now let me offer a humble and candid assessment of where we stand now in January 2024. 

Despite the efforts of many wonderful allies and advisors, my efforts over the last 24 months to catalyze an inter-network [[Meta Project]] in response to previously-looming-and-now-apparent [[Meta Crisis]] have been unsuccessful. My assessment is that this is due to a combination of my own inadequacies and limitations, the inadequacies and limitations of the current organizational and governance structures, and the sheer fact that we are attempting something New, which has not previously been done, and for which no roadmap or proven recipe exists. I take full responsibility for the failures, and am transforming and learning as rapidly as I can. 

Yet I remain convinced that none of us can succeed in isolation, and the only Way to advance from here is to forge, out of the many amazing individuals in the network, a higher order functional unity actually powerful enough to meet the needs and solve the challenges at hand. I remain convinced that Unity, true Spiritual collaboration with God and One Another, is the One Thing that makes all other things possible. I continue to believe that it is necessary to connect, equip and empower 3% of the population, ~240 million leaders, as rapidly as possible, nominally by 2026. I continue to believe our communities, tribes, and nations require a massive reset with constitutional amendments that push power back out to individuals and localities and forge a New Covenant as One Citizenship Under God. And I continue to believe that the infrastructure, systems, and technologies we have forged through Lionsberg and associated groups towards this Aim represent an unparalleled and necessary starting point. Perhaps even a first-time-in-history opportunity. 

This January, after seven years of concerted effort and bruising battles, we have arrived at the end of our personal resource runway. We are now making week to week decisions balancing debt, food, clothing, shelter, and progress. We have sacrificed our own family's security and are acting as if the suffering or flourishing of generations to come hangs in the balance, because we believe it to be so. Other individuals in the network of Goodwill are doing the same, and the status quo cannot continue. 

And so, in place of an inspiring manifesto I humbly issue a heartfelt plea, and an invitation to join us for the adventure of lifetime. 

Whether I am continuing to work on this full time, or forced to spend time provisioning my household in other ways, my ongoing Aim is to forge, out of the many amazing people I have had the honor of relating to, One unified body. An army. A community. A Force For Good. And to do everything I can to make that body strong enough to confront and overcome the Chaos, and forge the Best Possible Future For All. The Critical Path of the project will advance in proportion to the time, energy, attention, and resources directed at it. 

It would be soul destroying to not advance this Mission full time in 2024 and beyond, knowing all I have come to know about the state of our world, its trajectory, and the profound risks to billions of citizens. Full time focus and basic administration for the backbone requires $30k / month. A reasonable effort requires $50k / month. A concerted effort requires $100k / month. And if we were going to treat our efforts to meet this moment in history with anything approximating the seriousness of starting a business, we would pull together $2M to $10M in working capital, to be replenished on a monthly basis as we report Critical Path Progress towards [[The Goal]]. 

If you are one of Us, we invite you to join us for the adventure of a lifetime. Visit [www.JordanNicholas.org](https://jordannicholas.org) and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement).  Or email at J@Lionsberg.org with your ideas, inspirations, and what you might be able to bring to the table. 

My intention is to rapidly reassess interest and resources, and send out an update on next steps by early February. 

It is all on the line. You are here for a reason. The world needs you. It would be a deep honor to serve you as we advance together towards The Goal. 

Onward in Faith, Hope, and Love, 

~ J

#### P.S. On the 2024 United States Presidential Election 

If you are wondering about the US Presidency in 2024, as we have said from the outset it is not possible to reclaim our democracy by “running for President” in our presently corrupt, deceitful and failing system. Any such effort is dead on arrival, and we are presently watching hundreds of millions of dollars being wasted in that process. 

However it is possible for the wise center two thirds of a tribe or nation to arise, unite and sweep a transformative [[New Vision and Plan]] into being. I am not campaigning for the US Presidency. I am campaigning for the Kingdom of God. Because I believe that life or death for hundreds of millions or billions of people depends upon the existing systems not collapsing into chaos or rising into totalitarian order, I will continue advocating for a constitutional amendment in the United States that would reset the American Experiment, shrink the federal government by at least 80%, decentralize and redistribute power and authority back to states and localities, and make the US among the first nations to enact and embody the New Covenant. If the people of the United States decide this plan is superior to status quo, I am willing to serve as chief executive to implement the plan.  

If the citizens of America so desired, we could accomplish this by Citizen Led organizing in each state, and a coordinated write-in campaign with front and back end block chain audits on an electoral system that both parties have claimed is corrupt. I recognize this sounds ridiculous at first, and would be unprecedented in US or human history. However if God and We The People will it to be, it is entirely socially and mathematically possible. Because the Mission of the Kingdom involves the total realignment of power and authority on Earth, realigning the world’s existing center of power and gaining access to our common storehouse of resources and capabilities laid up in the United States government would be a substantial boon and accelerant to the Mission. Additionally, it is likely that the spiritual war will continue to spill over into the physical world, and We will need substantial military and logistical capabilities which at present exist only in sufficiently organized quantities in the United States and its alliances. 

In the event Americans decide to forgo  what is likely the final opportunity to reset the American experiment before it ceases to exist, our efforts to co-create a perpetual global Community / Force For Good whose definite purpose is the Kingdom of God will be of immense value as we work together to navigate the reset of the existing order. 

It would be incredibly foolish and likely genocidal to consciously allow the existing order to undergo a disorderly collapse. A voluntary and consciously designed transcendence into an intentionally designed Future is a far superior and less risky strategy. However it is up to Us, the people, to decide. Those of us who desire to do so can immediately find One Another and begin regardless of the outcome for any specific tribe or nation. I will be on the battlefield if you would like to join me.
