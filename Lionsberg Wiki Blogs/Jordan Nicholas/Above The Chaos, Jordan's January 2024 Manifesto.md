# Above The Chaos, Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto

Greetings loved ones and allies, 

As another year in the epic story of the human species aboard planet Earth slips into history, it is more evident than ever that despite our best efforts and progress to date, what got us here will not carry us forward to the Better Future we all desire. 

My current best understanding is that there is an 80% to 90% plus probability that the current order is on the brink of a disorderly collapse. Our house divided against itself will not stand. 

The solution is to forthrightly arise, unite, wage the battle for the future of our civilization, and establish the Kingdom of God on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

This involves assembling an unprecedented global Force For Good to  vanquish corruption and injustice, solve the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, and forge the Best Possible Future for All. 

Over the last 7 years, we have laid the groundwork and built the systems and technology to enable such an unprecedented Citizen Led response. We are now assembling a perpetual community for this definite purpose. 

To start the year, I spent some time alone in the mountains in dialogue with God and recorded three fireside chats that cover: 

1. The State of Our World - [Fireside Chat 1 - The State of Our World](https://youtu.be/UFLKfZlGi08?si=ataOdvzSScwB_ate)
2. The Probability of Collapse - [Fireside Chat 2 - On Collapse](https://youtu.be/mR6YMzWRlt8?si=8-A_8YkyFinqgl39)
3. A Positive Vision, Strategy and Plan to forge the Best Possible Future - [Fireside Chat 3 - A Vision, Strategy, and Plan](https://youtu.be/DAcg7AV0RJg?si=6FZlrKswfHqOl9mk)

Additionally, over the last few years I developed a series of interlinked writings that explore the [[Meta Crisis]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]] from a variety of angles - see the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] and the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]]. 

The only Way to advance from here is to forge, out of the many amazing individuals in the network, a higher order functional unity actually powerful enough to meet the needs and solve the challenges at hand. Our audacious goal is to connect, equip and empower 3% of the population, ~240 million leaders, by 2026. We can't do it alone. 

As for me and my tribe, we are sacrificing everything and acting as if the suffering or flourishing for generations to come were at stake. 

If you are one of Us, visit [www.JordanNicholas.org](https://jordannicholas.org) and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement).  A donation of any amount will ensure that you are connected to the emerging community, and help accomplish the crucial next milestone of establishing public support for the mission.  

We will send out an update on next steps by early February based on the individuals and resources who assemble in January. 

It is all on the line. You are here for a reason. The world needs you. 

Onward in Faith, Hope, and Love, 

~ J

#### P.S. On the 2024 United States Presidential Election 

If you are wondering about the US Presidency in 2024, as we have said from the outset it is not possible to reclaim our democracy by “running for President” in our presently corrupt, deceitful and failing system. Any such effort is dead on arrival. However it is possible for the wise center two thirds of a tribe or nation to arise, unite and sweep a transformative [[New Vision and Plan]] into being. I am not campaigning for the US Presidency. I am campaigning for the Kingdom of God. Because I believe that life or death for hundreds of millions or billions of people depends upon the existing systems not collapsing into chaos or rising into totalitarian order, I will continue advocating for a constitutional amendment in the United States that would reset the American Experiment, shrink the federal government by at least 80%, decentralize and redistribute power and authority back to states and localities, and make the US among the first nations to join the emergent Lionsberg Federation. If the people of the United States decide this plan is superior to status quo, I am willing to serve as chief executive to implement the plan. We can accomplish this by Citizen Led organizing in each state, and a coordinated write-in campaign with front and back end block chain audits on the apparently corrupt electoral system. I recognize this rate of adoption would be unprecedented in US or human history. However if God and We The People will it to be, it is entirely socially and mathematically possible. Because the Mission of the Kingdom involves the total realignment of power and authority on Earth, realigning the world’s existing center of power and gaining access to our common storehouse of resources and capabilities laid up in the United States government would be a substantial boon and accelerant to the Mission. Additionally, it is likely that the spiritual war will continue to spill over into the physical world, and We The People will need substantial military and logistical capabilities which at present exist only in sufficiently organized quantities in the United States. 

In the event Americans decide to forgo the final opportunity to reset the American experiment before it ceases to exist, our efforts to co-create a perpetual global Community whose definite purpose is the Kingdom of God will be of immense value as we work together to navigate the collapse of the existing order and establish the Kingdom out of its ashes. The creation of a coordinated, millions-strong Force For Good grows even more important to survival and success if Americans do not wake up and act before the existing system collapses or is further co-opted. 

It would be incredibly foolish to allow the American Order to undergo a disorderly collapse. A voluntary and consciously designed transcendence into an intentionally designed Future is a far superior and less risky strategy. However it is up to We The People to decide whether it is time to forge a More Perfect Union. Those of us who desire to do so can immediately find One Another and begin regardless of the outcome for any specific tribe or nation.
