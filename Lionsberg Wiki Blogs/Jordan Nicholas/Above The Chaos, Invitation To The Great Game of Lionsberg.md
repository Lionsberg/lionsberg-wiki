# Above The Chaos, Invitation To The Great Game of Lionsberg

Esteemed Friends, 

Having returned from a trip to Egypt and Israel to meet with allies and finish preparing / transforming, it is now time to [[Enact]] [[The Plan]]. 

## Where We Are In The Story

Over the last centuries, humanity has made great and tragic progress. 

Yet we now find ourselves accelerating towards a great [[Chasm]]. It is apparent that our present trajectory will actually lead us to ruin. The institutions we looked to for leadership and Wisdom in the past have revealed themselves to be corrupted, willfully blind, failing, and incapable of leading us into the future. 

We are at the moment in the [[Story]] where, in this decade, humanity will either arise and unite to escape its present trajectory towards ruin and leap across the [[Chasm]] into a [[New]] and [[Good]] [[Time]] and [[Space]]... 

...or descend off the cliff into the [[Chaos]], Darkness, and [[Suffering]] that lies that the end of our present Logic. 

There are millions of heroic individuals around the world awaking and arising to meet this moment in the Story. 

Yet struggling isolation, we are [[All]] on a pathway towards inevitable [[Failure]]. 

## An Invitation And Proposal

Over the last 5 years, we have synthesized lifetimes of preparation into a [[Vision]], [[The Plan|Plan]], [[Provisional Structure|Structure]], [[The Story|Story]], and [[The Great Game of Lionsberg|Game]] to empower humanity arise and unite to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals inherent in this critical moment in the universal Story. 

[[The Great Table]] has been prepared, 170 organizations in 17 countries have already adopted and tested the external side of the platform, and plans have been reviewed by dozens of people over the last months. It is time to commence the movement / game. 

You are hereby invited to [[Play]]. 

My proposal is that we, as a human species 8 billion strong, dedicate 1/10th of our available [[Flow]] of [[Energy]] and [[Resources]] to learn to play a [[New Game]] together for the good of [[All Generations of Life]] before it is too late. It is a small sacrifice, that everyone can afford, that has the [[Potential]] to change the course of human history and usher in the greatest period of purpose, meaning, and abundance the world has ever known. 

Recognizing that is big lift, and it will take some time and trust to get there, we will start with a basic standard of transparency and reciprocity that will allow us to come into relationship, and move towards greater collaboration and coordination over time. 

## Vision

We Envision a [[New Game]], guided by the Spirit of [[Truth]] and [[Love]], in which a distributed global network of [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and [[Self Governing]] [[Groups]] [[Help One Another]] make [[Individual And Local]] [[Progress]] towards our overarching and uniting [[Universal Goals and Values]]. 

We Envision [[Co-Creating]] a [[New World]] in which [[All]] things [[Help One Another]] rise towards the fullness of their unique [[Potential]], and [[Flourish]] in [[Harmony]]. 

We Envision [[All]] tribes and peoples voluntarily rising into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems, and capturing the opportunities inherent in this critical moment in [[The Great Story]] of the human species aboard Planet [[Earth]]. 

We Envision [[Co-Creating]] a Flourishing and Abundant world that works for us [[All]], across [[All Generations of Life]], [[Time]], and [[Space]]. 

And we Envision accomplishing it within this generation, and passing the baton. 

## Theory

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that the only mechanisms available to us that can scale out to the size required, in the time required, are [[Story]] and [[Play]]. 

Therefore we have created a Mythical Story big enough to contextualize and encompass us [[All]], a universal and eternal Game big enough for us [[All]] to play, and a sophisticated enough platform and data model to empower and align the efforts of billions of [[Self Governing]] [[Small Groups]].  

The end result is not ephemeral - it is actually a New World composed of 8 billion realigned human beings working together to make our reality [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

## Infrastructure

We have spent the last 5 years synthesizing together lifetimes of infrastructure, technology, language, story, platform, and a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] we thought might be required for this to work. 

The infrastructure has been vetted and tested by ~170+ Impact Organizations in 17 countries over the last 12 months. 

## Tipping Point Strategy

We are now embarking on a tipping point strategy of progressively onboarding a billion small groups, effectively encompassing all of humanity, within 7 years. 

This is possible if just 3 to 12 small groups begin learning [[How To Play The Game]] in Q4 2022, and [[The Game]] expands itself along the Golden Ratio of 62% every 4 to 6 weeks for 7 years. 

This strategy, if successful, will result in an invitation being extended to all 8 billion humans, by someone they love and trust, to forge or join a small group that can help them progress towards the fullness of their unique potential and flourish in a harmonious and properly ordered society. 

## Welcome To The Great Game Of Lionsberg 

We have spent the last 5 years synthesizing lifetimes of preparation into a complete System / Ark to help humanity and the [[Living System]] escape its current bondage to a corrupted and failing [[Old System]], cross the [[Chasm]], and [[Progress]] towards a [[New World]] that can be superior in every way to the [[Old World]] we are leaving behind. 

It is not possible to explain how the entire System works, so we have simplified it all into a Game so simple that any family can play, and yet so powerful that as we learn to play it together, we will actually be elevating, transforming, and regenerating our lives and our world. 

Welcome to [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]. 

## How It Works

[[The Great Game]] is rooted in a tipping point strategy to connect and empower small groups to make [[Individual And Local]] [[Progress]] towards our overarching and uniting [[Universal Goals and Values]]. 

Any group of at least 3 qualifies as a [[Small Groups|Small Group]]. [[Small Groups]] are the basic units of [[The Game]]. 

[[Individuals]] [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Small Groups]] to [[Help One Another]] [[Progress]], and accomplish things that individuals cannot accomplish in isolation. 

[[Small Groups]] in turn [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Group Of Groups|Groups Of Groups]] to [[Help One Another]] [[Progress]], and accomplish things that [[Small Groups]] cannot accomplish in isolation. 

Every Small Group is [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] and focuses 90% of its available [[Flow]] of [[Energy]] and [[Resources]] on meeting needs, solving problems, and accomplishing goals in its own unique locality / niche.

Every Small Group contributes 10% of its available [[Flow]] of [[Energy]] and [[Resources]] to continuously improving the shared Platform / Ecosystem of resources and solutions available to [[All]]. This ecosystem work is coordinated by a small [[Core Enterprise]] operating in service to the entire [[Group Of Groups]]. 

In exchange for contributing 10% of its [[Energy]] and [[Resources]] to the [[Whole]], each group gains access to the total set of continuously improving solutions, resources, and [[Value]] being co-created by the entire ecosystem. 

As [[Small Groups]] choose an [[Aim]] and [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]], they report out on the progress, opportunities and needs at hand, which the [[Core Group]] then prioritizes and incorporates into the [[Road Map]] and [[System Wide Master Plan]]. 

## Objective Of The Game 

The objective of [[The Great Game]] is for each Group to [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]], by helping [[All]] others do the same.  

[[The Goal]] is to help life develop towards the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony. 

This requires accomplishing the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and solving the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]] by co-creating the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] in which that can occur. 

[[Progress]] is made in [[Small Groups]] of 3 to 20 people. 

The near term [[Aim]] is to connect and empower one billion [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] small groups within 7 years. 

From that [[Milestones|Milestone]], every other Good Goal humanity could imagine becomes imminently possible. 

## Every Story A Prophesy - Movement Building 

As [[Small Groups]] make Local progress towards our Universal Goals, we will aggregate up and report out to [[One]] and [[All]] on the total [[Progress]] and [[Value]] being co-created. 

Each story of hope, transformation, and progress will become a prophesy of even greater things to come in the future as the movement grows, and can fuel the inspiration and crowd funding that powers the movement. 

## What Becomes Possible If This Succeeds 

_When_ this succeeds, for this first time in history all humanity and the entire [[Living System]] will be liberated to govern itself in service of and right relationship to [[One]] and [[All]]. 

When [[All]] of us are connected to a shared Platform of resources and solutions that empowers us [[All]] to [[Help One Another]] develop towards the fullness of our [[Potential]] and flourish in harmony, we will be in a world that is becoming more Perfect every day because we are [[All]] working together to make it so. 

This plan, enacted immediately, makes it possible for humanity to avoid a descent into the [[Chasm]] of [[Chaos]] and [[Suffering]] by voluntarily leaping forward into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems, and accomplishing the goals inherent in this millennium. 

## What Is At Stake If This Fails 

If this fails, there is a non-zero probability, and perhaps likelihood, that the collapse of the corrupted and failing [[Old System]] will cause a general descent into [[Chaos]] and [[Suffering]] that could take many generations to recover from. 

A house divided against itself cannot stand, and the nations and peoples of the world are currently divided against one another. The [[Old]] System is creaking and groaning. 

## Timing 

The shared universal sense seems to be that this decade may be our last chance to voluntarily choose what comes next. 

Therefore, we are setting a timeline of 7 years to invite All humanity into the [[New]] Story and the [[New]] Game. 

7 Years is approximately 2,555 days. Wednesday, November 16, 2022 is Day 1. The clock starts ticking tomorrow. 

## Who Is Invited? 

The Spirit of absolute and unconditional Love extends out to [[All]], equally and without exception. 

This is an open invitation to everyone who is willing to play by the [[Rules Of The Game]], strive towards the [[Universal Goals and Values]], and [[Help And Not Harm]] others as we [[All]] progress together away from [[Suffering]] and towards [[The Goal]].  

Our Aim is to ensure that [[All]] our loved ones have the opportunity to self-organize into small groups that can communicate and [[Help One Another]], come what may. 

## The Cost Of The Game 

The Game is free to any group that wants to play. 

To Sustain the Game, all groups must commit to allocate some percentage of the [[Flow]] of energy and resources available to them to the continuously improving [[Core]] / Ecosystem. 

Full System Membership requires 10% contribution. To begin, groups can select any value above 3% they feel is fair and reciprocal. 

In return, each group receives access to the entire set of continuously improving resources and solutions available to All. 

## Duration Of The Game

[[The Game]] is designed to get [[A Little Better Every Day]], eternally. Each generation plays The Game, improves it, and passes the baton. 

If it even begins to work a little bit, The Game will become will likely become the most valuable thing on earth, and every being on earth will have an equal stake in it and an equal incentive to make sure The Game continues to get a little better every day, forever. 

## Progress To Date

This is not a whim. This is actually the single most thoroughly vetted and thought through program of action we have come across. 

The external facing side of the platform has already been adopted and tested by over 170 different impact organizations in 17 countries, and a variety of individuals, organizations, and projects are beginning to connect. 

## Bridge Funding

This strategy will ultimately set billions of dollars in [[Flow]], and the be self-sustaining based on crowd-funding and the internal 1/10th of resources that will be dedicated to continuously improving the Quality of the platform, ecosystem, and community. 

Getting there will require a few years of runway to scale up. Although we have constructed a plan that can be accomplished independently of any external resources, the 7 year constraint and urgency of the global situation impels us to seek $5M to $20M in bridge funding to create the runway and secure the [[Time]] and Focus of the top talent we have engaged. This is a broad range that governs the speed at which a multi-billion dollar program of action can be sparked.
