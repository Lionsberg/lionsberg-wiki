# Above The Chaos, Realizations

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

This morning I was pondering the concepts of [[Experiential Learning]], [[Transformational Experiences]], and the [[Realizations]] / [[Epiphanies]] that result from our [[Journey]] into the [[Unknown]].  

See [[Realizations]] for a quick write up. 

The [[Divine Blueprints]] call for a [[New]] program of [[Lifelong Learning and Development]] to be made equally available to [[All]]. 

[[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] reflect this in Pillar 4: Holistic Education and Lifelong Learning.
