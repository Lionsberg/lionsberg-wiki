# Untitled 1

We realized that we couldn't work on it in the abstract... 

needed to create the container, governance structure, direction - get everyone who wanted to play in one place, then start continuoulsy improving the conditions and infrastructure in response to the prioritized needs of the [[Group Of Groups]].

a platform to 1. listen 2. meet needs 3. solve problems for internally impelled leaders, groups, and solutionaries moving in service of [[Life]] and [[The Goal]]. 

Start with 5 or 20... 

then progressively on-board thousands of leaders and groups... onto a shared platform... through which they can connect up those they serve... to a continuously improving set of solutions... for individuals, organizations, and communities. 

All transparently stewarded for the good of [[All]]. 

a network is too abstract. need to build something concrete and embodied. 

Identities (for each individual, organization, and community)

The function - is to serve - which means to meet needs and solve problems... 

of high leverage leaders... that are meeting needs and solving problems in their respective domains.

When we deeply long to work together and coordinate as one body we know how. 

But that is not the issue. 

There is a far deeper heart / spirit / soul issue... 

What I can do for now is use the fullness of my being to see if I can draw individuals, organizations, and communities into awareness and communication with one another, and curate access to solutions that will help them develop towards their potential and flourish. 

When either pain or necessity demands that we collaborate, we have far deeper systems and structures available and understand how to do that. 

**Producing Content** 
- Interviews, conversations, meetings, summits - each broadcast as broadly as is possible. 

**Fractionating Content:**

Building capacity to process and fractionate video and audio content, and repurpose it into many other mediums. 
- Shorter videos 
- hash tags
- memes
- clothing / swag / stickers 

hashtagging system for noting especially resonant moments... 

(see Pete notes on harvesting / composting)

Cutting all content into 1, 3, 7, 10, 15 minute clips with various titles and strategies for spreading... 

Adjusting time, style, and titles to see what works. Measuring results and getting a little better every day. 

Translating the transcripts into as many languages as we can. 


# Cut and Paste Somewhere Else

- The most powerful tool of an interviewer is silence 
	- At some point, the interviewee will always fill the silence
- Never try to go back and recreate or replicate something you've done before that emerged organically. It will come across as fake. Learn, grow, stay present, and let the next magical thing happen organically. 

- Politicians acting instrumentally - to accomplish an outcome - craft and plan their words, twist, avoid... 

- Do not conflate your Self with the [[Principles]] for which you stand. 
- The vast majority of what I have learned I learned from great thinkers, who learned from great thinkers, who learned from great thinkers. 

- Take responsibility - I missed the mark, and here is how I see I can improve. 

- careful attention  
- proper speech 
- paying attention, noticing, calling out the Good


### Handling Attention 
- If you become known... you must distinguish between your [[True Self]], and the shallow "you" known by society. 
	- There is your [[True Self]], and separately your reputation and brand. 
	- It is your [[True Self]] that must always manifest its [[Self]]... never reducing your [[Self]] to a mimic of Who We Used To Be... never playing out a fake Persona... 
	- It is the [[Light]] and [[Divine Spark]] of the [[True Self]] that is what is ultimately attractive. 
- Serve the One and the Principles in the Abstract
	- Confessions of where you fall short, miss the mark, fail to live up to the [[Ideal]]. 
	- Putting forward the principles for which you stand, and not your [[Self]] 
- Surrounded by [[Wise Council]] and [[Feedback]] so that you can calibrate, [[Navigate]], and [[Progress]] in the [[Wise Right]] [[Way]] through the dangers, toils, and snares that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 
- An audience of [[One]]. 
	- Whatever you do, do it with all your might, as unto the [[One]] - you never know who is watching, and [[One]] always is. [[One]] or one might be watching who could [[Elevate And Transform]] your life. Even in that tiny audience of [[One]] or twenty. 

- Chase the [[Highest Aim]], chase the [[Highest Dream]], do what must be done, [[Progress]], and [[Never Give Up]]. 

Criticizing not the institutions... 
- but the behaviors that deviate from the [[Principles]] and [[Values]] we say we believe in... 
- If there is a manifestation of a behavioral problem, there must be something in our [[Culture]] that allowed it... 
- Therefore it is our [[Responsibility]]... 
- Taking extreme ownership over [[Culture]] in a [[Zero Blame Environment]]... 
- if something went wrong, it is because we are part of, tolerating, perpetuating, co-creating a culture and environment in which that behavior is able to manifest. 

Virtues
- productive
- stable
- wise
- generous 
- be authentic
- tell the truth 
- take on as much respnsiblity as you can bear 
- grow up 
- integrate yourself
- integrate yourself productively into a family 
- integrate yourself and your family productively into a community 
- integrate yourself and your family and your community productively into a society 
- uphold the standards and values
- strive to get a little better every day

Standards are judges... 
- If someone is criticizing you for not living up to the Standard... 
- we can try to tear down the Standard... 
- or say "Thank God there is a Standard" - I agree - let's work together to improve. 
- How can we help one another integrate and organize ourselves and put our selves together in such a way that we conform more closely to the standard / ideal? 
- The issue for America, and every nation on earth, is not to attempt to justify our selves or lwoer the standard... but to rediscover them and raise them back up... accept their judgment... and see how we can put our selves together in a such a way that reconform our selves to them and begin to live up to them... 
- That is the message: 
	- To raise up the standards, as judgmental and terrifying as they are... 
	- and see how we cna live up to them, conform our selves to them, embody them... 
	- measuring our selves not against the Standard of Perfection / Ideal we aspire to, but against who we were yesterday... 


People taking credit when things go right, and distributing blame when things go wrong. 
People stealing other people's ideas and claiming credit. 
People not doing their job. 
People distributing blame when things go from for their own mistakes. 

Some Jewish elders say... that In Genesis - W=what we translate as "helpmate" is more nuanced - something more like "beneficial adversary". 

1,000 true believers, willing to contribute and create the runway to see if this can fly...

inspiring, passionate, raw, vulnerable, strong... 

Identifying and incorporating a broad range of virtues into your personality... so that you become well rounded, expansive, and capable of contending with and dancing with whatever dares to come your way. 

The formulation of a massive and positive vision...

An inspiring and compelling [[Forward Looking Story]] 
An inspiring and compelling [[Backward Looking Story]] 


How the mind transforms itself through experience
How the mind repairs itself
