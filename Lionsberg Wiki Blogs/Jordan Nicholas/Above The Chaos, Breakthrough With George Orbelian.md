# Above The Chaos, Breakthrough With George Orbelian 

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.04.14 _(updated 2024.04.14)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

[[George Orbelian]] has spent the last 10 years attempting to curate and map together the people and solutions required to accomplish [[The Goal]]. He has assembled these in a monster document he calls BREAKTHROUGH. 

Below I begin to weave and interlink the solutions and concepts with the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]], and make the combination available to the public for the first time. 

The post below is at present 7% complete - and already brimming with useful information for [[The Movement]]. (Note to self - left off at page 6 of 84). 

## Selected Quotes 

“In its complexities of design integrity, the Universe is technology. The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish compared to the elegance of non-humanly contrived regeneration. Man does not spontaneously recognize technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest as something he ignorantly calls nature.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"We are spirits of [[Love]] (Unification) and [[Freedom]] (Independence / [[Sovereignty]]), reflected in patterns of Sacred Geometry, unique in Universe." 

"Creativity is at bottom the combinatorial work of memory and imagination. All of our impressions, influences, and experiences — every sight we have ever seen, every book read, every landscape walked, every love loved — become seeds for ideas we later combine and recombine, largely unconsciously, into creations we call our own. The most wondrous thing about these seeds is that, when they first fall into the fallow ground of the mind, we have no sense of what they will bloom into years, decades, and selves later, what alchemic cross-pollination will take place between them and other seeds in the dark underground of consciousness where we become who we are." - Maria Papova 

“The illiterate of the 21st Century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who can not learn, unlearn, and relearn.” – Alvin Toffler

“Thought is the language of the Brain – Feeling is the language of the Body.” – Joe Dispenza

“If you want to know what the state of your mind has been, look at your body. If you want to know what the state of your body will be, look at your mind.” – Deepak Chopra

"We have four ways through which we can see and interact with the world: through the physical / body, intelligence / mind, emotion / sentience, transformation / energy - memory can influence intent, logic is a foundation of our constantly developing awareness. [[Awareness]] is a consequence of [[Consciousness]]" - Sadhguru – Is Consciousness a Miracle Harvard’s Cognitive Scientist Professor Steven Pinker & Sadhguru - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGDQPZYmQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGDQPZYmQM)  

"Life is social. It exists in communities and collectives. You and I are both composed of a collection of organs and tissues: the organs are made-up of billions of living cells, each of which can also live independently. Then the cells themselves, as Lynn Margulis has shown, are communities of micro-organisms that once lived free. The energy transforming entities of animal cells, the mitochondria, and of plants, the mitochondria, and chloroplasts, both were once bacteria living independently.” - James Lovelock, _The Ages of Gaia_

	- “Nature is a free market system,” Barlow wrote in 1998. “A rain forest is an unplanned economy, as is a coral reef. The difference between an economy that sorts the information and energy in photons and one that sorts the information and energy in dollars is a slight one in my mind. Economy _is_ ecology.”
	- The Ghost of John Perry Barlow Lives in His Posthumous Memoir / Mother American Night will become the crucial document for understanding the trippy, contradictory life and work of the internet pioneer and Grateful Dead lyricist.[https://www.wired.com/story/the-ghost-of-john-perry-barlow-lives-in-his-posthumous-memoir/](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ghost-of-john-perry-barlow-lives-in-his-posthumous-memoir/)
	- “Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter. I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls ‘turn-key totalitarianism.’”
