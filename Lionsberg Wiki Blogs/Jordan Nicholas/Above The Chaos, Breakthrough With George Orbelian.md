# Above The Chaos, Breakthrough With George Orbelian 

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.04.14 _(updated 2024.04.26)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

[[George Orbelian]] has spent the last 10 years curating and mapping the people and solutions required to accomplish [[The Goal]]. He has assembled these in an epic document he calls BREAKTHROUGH. 

Below we begin to weave and interlink the solutions and concepts with the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]], and make the combination available to the public for the first time. 

The 116,000 words below, along with hundreds of links to videos, websites, solutions, and themes, already represent a university degree full of information on the transformation of our lives and our world. 

The document makes it clear that the heroes and solutions exist and are already on the front lines of every battle... the solutions and patterns are known. 

All we need to do is align and unite the social, political, and economic will. 

It is my prayer that the [[Lionsberg System]] and [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] might be of service to connecting and empowering the distributed [[Force For Good]] outlined below. 

Time is short. Let's move. 

## Objective 

Our objective is to "make the world work, for 100% of humanity (and all the Earth's inhabitants), in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or disadvantage of anyone." - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  
## Summary 

The essence of our journey together is a healing, evolutionary metamorphic consciousness shift to a [[New Normal]]. Technology has allowed us to process more information faster. The challenge of education now is to align the most functional, nature informed schools of thought and practice into a design that is aligned with nature and allows [[The Commons]] to regenerate and thrive. One core educational process that continually gains insights from nature and informs in real time is critical for optimal decision making. Education must process viable solutions in context of change in real time in a way that unleashes human [[Flow]] potential. [[Technology]] can help us align [[Optimal Solutions]] as we anticipate adapting to change in real time. We can align our siloed breakthroughs, influencers and solutionaries into a cohesive collective global network of Buckminster Fuller / Biomimcry Aligned system thinkers that empower a regenerative future. Directly connecting geo-located creators with geo-located consumers creates a real time / global R&D network that empowers exponential evolution.  

One functional, global, nature-centric educational system with living, constantly updated information.

Consciousness is fundamental: matter, biology and energy are derivatives of consciousness. Mind is interface to consciousness. We are the Universe. We are made of component parts of the Universe. Everything is in vibration. The particles of Universe that have been organized into a pattern integrity and vibrational tone(s) that we recognize as life, uniquely align past / present / future trajectory. Every individual embodies and animates a unique combination of the universe aligned by their timeless spirit structure, continually evolving through experience. Life is an archive of Universe – and our unique combination of experiences drives our evolution. Our perspectives, and habits cultivate our individual / collective reality. What we choose to believe, is what we manifest. Our standard for the next stage of life on Spaceship Earth is to empower [[Flow]] for all life by closing the gap between what we learn / know and how we live / adapt. It is time that we close the gap between what we know and how we act so that we can adapt in real time with insights, applying our unique gifts, in flow, to collective evolution.

In addition, you can also put another sign that says, ‘I am not out there either,’ and a third sign that says, ‘If I am anywhere, it is in your mindful breathing and in your peaceful steps.’ ” Thich Nhat Hanh TRANSITION January 22, 2022 - Midnight (ICT)   

## What We Do 

1. We recognize that every human is unique / carries unique “wiring” / capacities for flow / capabilities and we are all carrying /inhibited / influenced by various levels of experiential programming and trauma.
2. We collectively empower people / move people into their [[Potential]] and [[Flow]].
3. We align humanity with solutions and optimal / system-wide / flow empowering decision making – pushing the perceived boundaries of potential with the best that is being done: [https://www.r3-0.org/](https://www.r3-0.org/)  
4. We recognize that we are in a transition from a physical to a metaphysical reality and embrace change at the speed of learning by reducing the lag between learning and getting comfortable with rebalancing change to adapting and supporting previously considered “IMPOSSIBLE” breakthroughs.
5. Everything we do is in Flow / Nature / Health / Expanding Optimal Potential based.
6. We align objectives and incentives – currently war is more profitable than peace and sick people are more profitable than healthy people: time to shift the planet from short term profits to the long-term abundance of healthy systems.
7. We acknowledge the relationship between environmental health and human health, create clear policy and laws to protect the Commons and restore the shared thriving health and immune system of Gaia.
8. Photons = Energy
9. Maximizing Diversification of Nutrient Flows = Matter
10. Our objective is to savor every photon shared by the sun and maximize diversified nutrient flows. (Tom Chi)  
11. We work with top forensic science / engineering failure analysis firm Exponent on a three (3) year $5Million dollar project to develop the plan for a regenerative future: [https://www.exponent.com/](https://www.exponent.com/)  
12. We employ Bow Tie Risk Assessment and Management Analysis: [https://www.aiche.org/ccps/resources/publications/books/bow-ties-risk-management-concept-book-process-safety](https://www.aiche.org/ccps/resources/publications/books/bow-ties-risk-management-concept-book-process-safety)  
13. We use [www.verses.io](http://www.verses.io) to transparently connect everything in real time: [www.planet.com](http://www.planet.com), satellite data, stoichiometric data, IOT (Internet of Things), IOBNT (Internet of Biological Nano Things), Stoichiometry (Science of Relationships), Pixels, Voxels (Volumetric Pixels), Moxels (Material Pixels), Proteomics (how proteins change), the METAVERSE as it is now being called, etc. which gives real time transparency into how everything is interconnected, interdependent and works: it is the ultimate supply chain monitor that immediately recognized point source pollution and allows us to maintain optimal, diversified, optimal nutrition flows.  
14. We use the spatial web / verses.io / IOBNT, Pixels, Moxels, Voxels, Proteomics and Stoichiometry to have a better understanding of interwoven relationships than we have ever had, and we empower those relationships to shift the planet from short term profits to long term abundance.  
15. We recognize, confront, disempower and dissolve stealth siloes of parasitic dynamics that killing life and our collective future.
16. We have precision insights into everything going into or out of a defined area – whether it is a cell or a city – VERSES.IO: [https://www.verses.io/press-archive/verses-leads-eu-digital-government-transformation-with-5-city-drone-project](https://www.verses.io/press-archive/verses-leads-eu-digital-government-transformation-with-5-city-drone-project)  
17. We use innovative data products to track cutting edge innovation: [https://tracxn.com/](https://tracxn.com/)  
18. We empower the native / indigenous / original peoples of this planet by supporting their traditional practices with scientific validation and learning how to adjust scientific inquiry based on their wisdom. We support them with science and sharing geo-located, relevant best practices globally to use their wisdom / optimal ways to restore their lands key to optimal bio-diversity dynamics of the lands / water / Ocean of the planet. – Internally, we connect all vital areas and their peoples with their own, private, secure global social network so they can share best practices – we then filter out the information they are ready to share to the broader global public as / when they are ready.
19. With planetary carbon / water climate change we no longer have the luxury of historically predictable weather with season normalcy – we need real time monitoring so that we can adapt to the unknown. As climatic conditions change, ecosystems will change – what can migrate will, and what can’t migrate will die or adapt. We will need to adapt and accommodate migration and humans and other species run for their lives.  
20. We use [www.verses.io](http://www.verses.io) to connect Finca Sangrada as an example of the land potential as guided by the Kogi and the Gump Research Station as Ocean potential as managed by Neil Davies.  
21. We support and empower Nature / Biomimicry based comprehensive anticipatory design science-based solutions globally.  
22. We share best practices and continually heal collective, generational embedded trauma and use solutions to update improvements to global environmental standards.  
23. Every creator / consumer relationship is geo-located, tracked and monitored for feedback empowering a global Research and Development network that shares best practices informing the whole of developments / trends in solutions.  
24. We change insurance / underwriting / actuarial data to align objectives with incentives for the health of interdependent and interconnective natural systems.  
25. Insurance actuarial data and underwriting objectives are set to empower regeneration and optimal health of the entire system.  
26. Militaries are refocused on improving the planet instead of destruction: military operations re-orient to help with disasters instead of creating them.  
27. We convert the militaries of the world from weaponry to livingry – deploying military level organization to save us rather than destroy us.  
28. We value our environment and enforce compensatory and restorative damages against the commons – no more profits for corruption, exploitation / extraction / trash / abandon / repeat leaving a trail of death, destruction, pollution and disease.  
29. We align global environmental objectives with incentives so that health and pushing the boundaries of human potential becomes the basis of the regenerative global economy.  
30. We restore the proper trees in places around the planet where they should be, guided by the wisdom of Diana Beresford Kroeger:

32. We disempower corruption with blockchain / extreme transparency – with everything traceable, and all parties involved visible, theft and corruption become impossible or so risky the risk of getting caught offsets any reward.  
33. We dissolve entrenched, legacy parasitic businesses that are made obsolete by the metaverse.  
34. We integrate all education on the planet – every library and school is connected to share best practices, geo-located specifics and cultural perspectives.  
35. We give up on the idea of children being educated in boxes to become citizens of the world – the world becomes our classroom and children are encouraged to flow, follow their bliss, be inspired, and mentored by those passionately following / flowing in their life purpose and destiny path.  
36. We regenerate the soils with Stamets, Sheldrake / Blume / Spackman / Shearer / Planetary Care = fungi, bacteria, fermentation, beneficial microbes.  
37. We outlaw poverty – shift the planet from short term profits to long term abundance using biomimetic solutions so that we can stop doing meaningless jobs that are a waste of human potential and contribute to wasteful consumption and Ecocide.  
38. We prioritize the protection of all children and women.  
39. We stop exploitation, slavery, exploitation.  
40. We make flow states a standard of health for human potential.  
41. We make it globally known that every human has rights, protection, education, shelter, love and a chance to reach their full potential.  
42. We share solutions and resources to help in every way to eliminate refugee camps that result from natural, man-made, cultural or war-based disasters.  
43. We outlaw war / murder.  
44. We assist in foreseeing and preventing climate / natural disaster influenced migration.  
45. We empower the health of the world and life instead of seeking “advantages” by disempowering.

## Selected Quotes 

"Beautiful earth we are a part of is timelessly designed to create life existing in perpetual flow, to eternally explore, build community, teams, expand capabilities, learn from each other's passions and insights; to explore, cross-pollinate our strengths and exponentially expand the potential of all life. We are part of this journey and together at this time for a reason."

"All life and experience is a co-creation, which should optimally be conceived in flow, born into flow, existing in and contributing to a universe of flow - to continually evolve and optimize collective potential."

“Take the initiative. Go to work, and above all co-operate and don’t hold back on one another or try to gain at the expense of another. Any success in such lopsidedness will be increasingly short-lived. These are the synergetic rules that evolution is employing and trying to make clear to us. They are not man-made laws. They are the infinitely accommodative laws of the intellectual integrity governing the universe.” – Buckminster Fuller

“It is not for me to change you. The question is, how can I be of service to you without diminishing your degrees of freedom?” – Buckminster Fuller  

“When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty but when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.” – Buckminster Fuller  

“In its complexities of design integrity, the Universe is technology. The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish compared to the elegance of non-humanly contrived regeneration. Man does not spontaneously recognize technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest as something he ignorantly calls nature.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"We are spirits of [[Love]] (Unification) and [[Freedom]] (Independence / [[Sovereignty]]), reflected in patterns of Sacred Geometry, unique in Universe." 

"Creativity is at bottom the combinatorial work of memory and imagination. All of our impressions, influences, and experiences — every sight we have ever seen, every book read, every landscape walked, every love loved — become seeds for ideas we later combine and recombine, largely unconsciously, into creations we call our own. The most wondrous thing about these seeds is that, when they first fall into the fallow ground of the mind, we have no sense of what they will bloom into years, decades, and selves later, what alchemic cross-pollination will take place between them and other seeds in the dark underground of consciousness where we become who we are." - Maria Papova 

“The illiterate of the 21st Century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who can not learn, unlearn, and relearn.” – Alvin Toffler

“Thought is the language of the Brain – Feeling is the language of the Body.” – Joe Dispenza

“If you want to know what the state of your mind has been, look at your body. If you want to know what the state of your body will be, look at your mind.” – Deepak Chopra

"We have four ways through which we can see and interact with the world: through the physical / body, intelligence / mind, emotion / sentience, transformation / energy - memory can influence intent, logic is a foundation of our constantly developing awareness. [[Awareness]] is a consequence of [[Consciousness]]" - Sadhguru – Is Consciousness a Miracle Harvard’s Cognitive Scientist Professor Steven Pinker & Sadhguru - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGDQPZYmQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGDQPZYmQM)  

"Life is social. It exists in communities and collectives. You and I are both composed of a collection of organs and tissues: the organs are made-up of billions of living cells, each of which can also live independently. Then the cells themselves, as Lynn Margulis has shown, are communities of micro-organisms that once lived free. The energy transforming entities of animal cells, the mitochondria, and of plants, the mitochondria, and chloroplasts, both were once bacteria living independently.” - James Lovelock, _The Ages of Gaia_ 
- [Tim Lenton Interviews James Lovelock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGziItCwDJA)

“Nature is an overall governing system – we as part of Nature have developed a level of complexity that has allowed us to use evolutionary product in new and unexpected ways. It is our responsibility to understand risks and limits -not only to our lives – but to all life.” – [[George Orbelian]]

"Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust. Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. Therefore in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled; the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests. The only thing that permits us to acquiesce in an erroneous theory is the lack of a better one; analogously, an injustice is tolerable only when it is necessary to avoid an even greater injustice. Being first virtues of human activities, truth and justice are uncompromising."  - From "A Theory of Justice" - by John Rawls - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice)  

"Natural ecosystems are complex. The word _complex_ comes from Latin root _plecetere_: to weave; entwine. “In complex systems, many simple parts are irreducibly entwined, and the field of complexity is itself an entwining of many different fields.”

Shifting from Newtonian mechanics, to Darwin's evolutionary biology, to process ecology is a shift from immutable laws to processes that are associated with linear development of single organisms and their communities; to complex systems processes that are dependent upon the vibrant exchange and flow of energy and matter between many organisms, their communities, and their environment.

In ecosystems, these complex systems processes function to sustain and grow the system. They do this through _autocatalytic mutualism_. Autocatalytic mutualism is the genetic code of ecosystems. The term _mutualism_ refers to the mutual interdependencies between two or more species in an ecosystem in which all benefit from the association. _Autocatalism_ means that the system is constantly generating an increase of energy and matter to sustain or grow itself from within. It does this by relying upon the mutual dependencies at work." - Design Unbound - Designing For Emergence In A White Water World - Ann M. Pendleton-Julian and John Seely Brown - [https://www.desunbound.com/](https://www.desunbound.com/)  

"One of the most fundamental beliefs in Dr. Teruo Higa’s philosophy is that “the essential condition for human happiness is the ability to do what one really loves, whatever that may be, throughout the course of one’s lifetime.” (P. 327, Teruo Higa, An Earth Saving Revolution)

"In order for human society to prosper, it is essential that the environment, food supplies and medical treatment be considered the common property of every man, woman and child on earth. Once we are able to establish a system by which this may be accomplished, humanity will move closer to a state of truth and people will attain greater maturity, receive veneration as they get older and be able to serve as assets of society. In order to attain such a state, it is necessary that humankind abandon its penchant for competitiveness and develop a new way of life based on coexistence and co-prosperity.”  

"Humans have always unknowingly affected all Universe by every act and thought they articulate or even consider.”

"Love in metaphysical gravity." 

“A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"Do you ever have the sense of... being helped by hidden hands?" - Bill Moyers 

"All the time. It is miraculous. I even have a superstition that has grown on me as a result of invisible hands coming all the time - namely, that if you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in your field of bliss, and they open doors to you. I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be." - [[Joseph Campbell]]  

"Nature once determined how we survive. Now we determine how nature survives.” - David Attenborough 

"Instead of reality being passively recorded by the brain, it is actively constructed by it." - David Eagleman  

"The world is not separated into winners and losers; it is separated into learners and non-learners.” - LaRae Quy

"Doing is the best type of thinking" - Tom Chi 

"Life runs on information and sunlight" - Janine Benyus - Biomimicry 

"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society." - J. Krishnamurti 

"Consciousness is fundamental - matter, biology, and energy are derivative of consciousness." 

"Mind is interface to consciousness - consciousness is the ocean, mind is the surfer."

"Consciousness means it is a memory-less intelligence - intelligence beyond memory."  

"Find what you love and continually dissolve lines of distinction until you become one with it."  

"Consciousness alone has the power to create miracles - collective consciousness is changing - consciousness has enormous power." 

"Use consciousness to create inner peace - become the peace and with kindness, imagine things falling into place."  - Shelley Von Strunkel 

“If you follow these three steps, namely you are always setting goals, you are always paying attention and you become immersed in whatever you do, the outcome is that you learn to enjoy whatever you are doing and that produces a sense of high energy, liveliness and flow.  The great gift of flow is that if you have learned to achieve this state you will have outcomes that match the best that we can dream of having in this life. First of all, you will enjoy every minute of your life. Second you will achieve personal growth, your skills will expand, your goals will become more and more important to you and to others. And the third outcome is, that it is through flow experiences that culture evolves: it is through flow that we can build new forms of art, new technologies, new science, new and better relationships among people, so the evolution of personal abilities, the development of personal skills, is the energy out of which the evolution of culture is made. If there is one legacy we can leave to the future, knowing that we have contributed something positive to it, it is to live our lives as a constant source of flow.” - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Me-high Cheek-sent-me-high)

"Flow is not only a human trait – all life is in evolutionary flow. Flow is the easiest way to move through existence – life does it naturally, intuitively, and for this step in our evolution, we are going to have to trust our senses to reconnect to nature and ourselves by letting go. Once you define the objective of life as being to support Flow, the design of the infrastructure of living becomes more obvious." 

"Enlightenment - just be happy, strong, and healthy, the rest is bullshit." - Wim Hof  

"We’ve got this: we have all the solutions we need – they are simply in experiential silos, distributed across time and space, seeded throughout our collective consciousness." 

"All thoughts are seeds, that will sprout and thrive based on the support of our collective consciousness learning and adapting." 

“The only war is the war against the imagination." - Diane DiPrima  

“If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be.” - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  

“Only the impossible happens. This Universe itself is impossible, and there it is. You and I are impossible and here we are.” - Buckminster Fuller 33:34 / 7:10:44 – Buckminster Fuller Werner Erhard conversation 7 Hour 10 Minute  

“Nature is always and everywhere transforming, you must join in the transforming by understanding the principles.” - Buckminster Fuller 36:56 / 7:10:44 – Buckminster Fuller Werner Erhard conversation 7 Hour 10 Minute  

“The scientific definition of skiing is the angular valving of gravity.” - Buckminster Fuller 

“There is no up or down in Universe – absolutely none, there is only in, out and around. In is always point to able and specific, out is in any direction. In the world of electromagnetics, you tune in and you tune out: out is everything you don’t have tuned in.” - Buckminster Fuller

“Science is at least half a millennium out of gear with its own knowledge and humanity always operates in terms to its conditioned reflexes.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

“Vitamin D is one of the vitamins essential to human life: it must combine with the calcium to produce our bone structure. Just as vegetation converts solar radiation to beautiful hydrocarbons through photosynthesis, vitamin D is produced by the human skin photosynthetically. It is one of the vitamins you can get overdoses of that can be lethal, so nature developed filters so you wouldn’t get too much of the vitamin D – she developed two kinds of filters, we call them melanin and keratin. So, what we call the dark skins are simply the filters have been introduced so they wouldn’t get overdosed with vitamin D. As people went north, nature removed the filters and their skin bleached out, the Eskimos and darker skinned people of the north got their vitamin D from a combination of vitamin D rich foods along with longer exposures during the summer. There is no such thing as race – there is none. If there was such a thing as race, psychologically you would never be able to cope with it, but the beautiful thing is, there isn’t any.”  - Buckminster Fuller – Buckminster Fuller Werner Erhard conversation 7 Hour 10 Minute

“New capabilities shape our belief of what’s possible and can drive rapid transformation.” - [[Tom Chi]]  

"The essence of life / survival is a constant co-created mixing of interacting variables unique to each life / ecosystem: tasting / eating is mixing, smelling / inhaling in mixing, breathing is mixing, drinking is mixing, touching is mixing, hearing is mixing, travel and migration is mixing, sex is mixing human potential, sight, hearing, and taste is mixing what is on the outside with what is on the inside, experience is mixing the old with the new - learning in the process - adapting to what we have learned / the past, with the insights that direct the focus of our attention based on following our individual bliss into flow - empowering us to evolve by continually learning and re-balancing our collectively co-created future of flow." 

"The meaning of life is simply to mix water and salts. Male and female forces come together to make water. Fire and Ice make water. Acids and bases mix to make water. Hot and cold mix and condense water. Sunlight and Darkness mix to create water (dew). Hydrogen (1) and Oxygen (8) bond to create water (9). Water is intrinsically tied to the universal 9s." - Joseph Cerecedes 

“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . .. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.” - The Chance for Peace Speech - Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered the _Chance for Peace_ speech in 1953, just three months after assuming the Presidency.

“War is obsolete. We are not here to fight something or tear something down; We are here to be the example of what is possible. Any sane individual will tell you that violence is … not the way.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

“Take the initiative. Go to work, and above all co-operate and don’t hold back on one another or try to gain at the expense of another. Any success in such lopsidedness will be increasingly short-lived. These are the synergetic rules that evolution is employing and trying to make clear to us. They are not man-made laws. They are the infinitely accommodative laws of the intellectual integrity governing the universe.” – [[Buckminster Fuller]] 

“We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims.” – Buckminster Fuller

“The thoughts you have determine the world you see.” – David Meltzer

In the late 1980s, Lieserl, the daughter of the famous genius, donated 1,400 letters, written by Einstein, to the Hebrew University, with orders not to publish their contents until two decades after his death.

This is one of them, for Lieserl Einstein.

…”When I proposed the theory of relativity, very few understood me, and what I will reveal now to transmit to mankind will also collide with the misunderstanding and prejudice in the world.

I ask you to guard the letters as long as necessary, years, decades, until society is advanced enough to accept what I will explain below.

There is an extremely powerful force that, so far, science has not found a formal explanation to. It is a force that includes and governs all others, and is even behind any phenomenon operating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us.

This universal force is LOVE.

When scientists looked for a unified theory of the universe, they forgot the most powerful unseen force.

Love is Light, that enlightens those who give and receive it.

Love is gravity, because it makes some people feel attracted to others.

Love is power, because it multiplies the best we have, and allows humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness.

Love unfolds and reveals.

For love we live and die.

Love is God and God is Love.

This force explains everything and gives meaning to life. This is the variable that we have ignored for too long, maybe because we are afraid of love because it is the only energy in the universe that man has not learned to drive at will.

To give visibility to love, I made a simple substitution in my most famous equation.

If instead of E = mc2, we accept that the energy to heal the world can be obtained through love multiplied by the speed of light squared, we arrive at the conclusion that love is the most powerful force there is, because it has no limits.

After the failure of humanity in the use and control of the other forces of the universe that have turned against us, it is urgent that we nourish ourselves with another kind of energy…

If we want our species to survive, if we are to find meaning in life, if we want to save the world and every sentient being that inhabits it, love is the one and only answer.

Perhaps we are not yet ready to make a bomb of love, a device powerful enough to entirely destroy the hate, selfishness and greed that devastate the planet.

However, each individual carries within them a small but powerful generator of love whose energy is waiting to be released.

When we learn to give and receive this universal energy, dear Lieserl, we will have affirmed that love conquers all, is able to transcend everything and anything, because love is the quintessence of life.

I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart, which has quietly beaten for you all my life. Maybe it’s too late to apologize, but as time is relative, I need to tell you that I love you and thanks to you I have reached the ultimate answer! “.

Your father Albert Einstein

	- “Nature is a free market system,” Barlow wrote in 1998. “A rain forest is an unplanned economy, as is a coral reef. The difference between an economy that sorts the information and energy in photons and one that sorts the information and energy in dollars is a slight one in my mind. Economy _is_ ecology.”
	- The Ghost of John Perry Barlow Lives in His Posthumous Memoir / Mother American Night will become the crucial document for understanding the trippy, contradictory life and work of the internet pioneer and Grateful Dead lyricist.[https://www.wired.com/story/the-ghost-of-john-perry-barlow-lives-in-his-posthumous-memoir/](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ghost-of-john-perry-barlow-lives-in-his-posthumous-memoir/)
	- “Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter. I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls ‘turn-key totalitarianism.’”

	- Manufacturing bio-ceramic geodesic dome components in automated micro-factories.
	- Democratizing regenerative village building with a market network. 
	- Serving the Earth and all her passengers as a Multi-Stakeholder Cooperative.
	- A regenerative ceramic raw materials industry is ready once we create the demand. We can use waste streams from lithium mining, seawater desalination, wastewater treatment, ash, sawdust, agricultural waste, etc. It all gets bound together in the crystalline ceramic matrix. But even without waste stream reclamation, Bio ceramic Domes generate 10x less embodied CO2 than a conventional house of equal size. And that's over a 50 year life, but our domes should last >500  years, because they can be repaired and resurfaced with the same ceramic material.....and there is nothing to rot, corrode, or rust. They have 10 inch thick insulation cavities (narrower with phase change insulation) and will require less operational energy than a passive house.
	- $30k small dome sale cost, ~ 80% margin. 
	- Ceramic components hardened and demolded ~ 3 minutes. 
	- Converting US concrete block making capacity to ceramic parts for domes could result in ~1 billion homes / year. 
	-  Bio photonic/Gas Discharge Variability Imaging 2) Measuring seed germination rates and 3) Measuring Heart Rate Variability. But sensitive people just feel it upon entering the dome. There is a good reason ancient (and modern) shamans built stone circles and pyramids. Materials and geometry matter.
	- We plan to establish a perpetual purpose-driven trust, to ensure that Geoship serves its co-operative mission now and for generations to come. 
	- Plan to set aside 30% to 50% of stock for multi-stakeholder model.

	- Like the world wide web - Spatial Web connects everything and enables creation of the World Game Model 
	- Then we apply AI to the World Game - and that means all AI - Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Singularity net - and VERSES - the most advanced AI in the world. 
	- Celebration and protection of The Commons 
	- McKinsey just completed a study of 300 Smart City projects around the world - and deemed them all FAILURES because they can't talk to each other and web together. They are silos. 
	- This is the problem have on the planet right now. That's why we feel so frustrated - it's moving too slowing by a factor of 10x
	- This is DELOITTE calling the Spatial Web the NEXT ERA IN COMPUTING.[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html)
	- And our Chief Scientist in AI is the leading Neuroscientist on the freaking planet - the guy everyone else goes to see to check their AI work - Dr. Karl Friston at UCL - shortlisted for a Nobel in the next year or two. [https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/)
	- Background:
	- We have so much research happening around the planet, but it is not interoperable. 
	- We had electronic publishing in the 80s before the world wide web in the 90’s but it was not in a form that was universally indexable, searchable, analyzable or hyperlink-able. 
	- Then Tim dropped HTTP in 94 and all of those documents had to be reformatted to come into compliance with HTML and be viewable by a browser and transferable over the network using HTTP. That transition created the greatest library in the history of the world (now 8 billion webpages) and enabled all sorts of new business models and entrepreneurial opportunities. The world was changed forever. Commerce was changed forever. Trillions of dollars of market cap were created. It's massive. 
	- But that was just the warmup act.  That is a web of pages. Pages about the world and everything in it. 
	- Now - because of Moore's law and high-speed networking we can finally put everything else online. 
	- Every building, every car, every factory, every port, every city, every tree, every bridge - in other words, we can now realize Buckminster Fuller's vision of The WORLD GAME. 
	- The Spatial Web is the ultimate goal - the Internet of Everything - The New World Game is the tool that is needed to meet the Paris accords. 
	- NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK.
	- As everything in the world is digitized by creating a digital copy of it (or as it's called - a Digital Twin), then all of the Digital Twins can be indexed, searchable, analyzable and hyper-interoperable. The entire surface of the planet can be turned into a giant holographic game world and AI can join with humans to simulate and optimize the management of the planet. This includes our carbon footprint, water quality, sustainable farming, smart cities, and all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. Without this new Spatial Web, this is not possible. We need a common protocol so that the world and everything in it becomes fully interoperable and programmable.

## Selected Articles 

### **From Education Automation – Freeing the scholar to return to his studies – Buckminster Fuller – 1962 – Southern Illinois University Press**

Comprehensively the world is going from a Newtonian static norm to an Einsteinian all motion norm. This is the biggest thing that is happening at this moment in history. We are becoming quick, and the graveyards of the dead become progressively less logical.

 We know that our **world population is increasing incomprehensibly swiftly**. There are **enormous numbers to be educated**. We are going to develop very **new attitudes** about our cross breeding and our reversion to universal pigmentation. That is going to be slow, but it is going to be a great and inevitable event. In the end we are going to recognize that there are no different species of living man, and we will get over that kind of color-class distinction.

The big question is how are we, as educators, going to handle the enormous increase in the new life. How do we make available to these new students, what we have been able to discover fairly accurately about the universe and the way it is operating? How are we going to be able to get them the true net value won blindly through the long tradition of ignorant dedications and hard-won lessons of all the unknown mothers and all the other invisibly heroic people who have given hopefully to the new life, such as, for instance, the fabulous heritage of mans stoic capacity to carry on despite immense hardships?

The **new life** needs to be inspired with the realization that it has all kinds of **new advantages** that have been gained through great dedications of unknown, unsung heroes of intellectual exploration and great intuitively faithful integrities of men groping in the dark. Unless the new life is highly appreciative of those who have gone before, it won't be able to take effective advantage of **its heritage**. It will not be as regenerated and inspired as it might be if it appreciated the comprehensive love invested in that heritage.

I think that one of the most important events of the educational revolution is the present realization that we are going to discover that **the child is born comprehensively competent and co-ordinate**, that it is capable of treating with large quantities of data and families of variables right from the start.

When parents make babies, they don't know what they are making. They don't know how to make what they make. All they do is “press a button”. Ours and our babies’ brains have a quadrillion times a quadrillion atoms already operative in coordinate patterning operation utterly transcendental to our conscious control. A quadrillion times a quadrillion atoms operates subconsciously in most extraordinary co-ordination make it possible, for example, for me to be communicating with you. We don't have anything consciously to do with the fundamentals of our communicating capability. Nor do we have anything to do consciously with pushing a million hairs out of our heads at preferred rates of colors and shapes. We don't know how to consciously coordinate our heart beating and our breathing. We don't know how at all we charge energies back and forth into the various glands of our systems. We really don't know what is going on at all, but we do coordinate it all subconsciously. What we do have in the brain is an extraordinary, orderly pattern manipulating capability to deal with that quadrillion times a quadrillion invisible atoms. This is all born into the child. The parent doesn't consciously put it there. Men may make may take no credit for the fundamentals of their relative success upon the earth upon earth.

I will say that it is very clear to me that when a child stands up breathing and coordinating all these complex patterns by himself and gets his own balance and starts drinking in the patterns of cosmos and earth he is apparently spontaneously interested in coordinating the total information - the total stimulation. **He craves to understand - to comprehend. That is why he asks his myriad questions**.

I am quite confident we are going to find ways of **helping the child to coordinate his spontaneous comprehension of the _whole_ instead of becoming a specialist** without losing any of the advantages gained by yesterday's exclusive specialization.

I'm quite certain that someday we will take a subject such as Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and with the “Einstein” of the subject and his colleagues working on it for a year we will finally get it reduced down to what is “net” in the subject and enthusiastically approved by the “Einstein” who gave the original lecture. **What is “net” will become communicated so well that any child can turn on a documentary device, a TV and get the Einstein lucidity of thinking and get it quickly and firmly**. I'm quite sure that we are going to get **research and development laboratories of education** where the faculty will become **producers of extraordinary moving picture documentaries**. That is going to be the big, new educational trend.

With two-way TV we will develop selecting dials for the children which will not be primarily an alphabetical but a visual _species_ and _chronological category_ selecting device with secondary alphabetical subdivisions. **The child will be able to call up any kind of information he wants about any subject and get the latest authoritative TV documentary**, the production of which I've already described to you, **the answers to questions and probing’s will be the best information that man has available up to that minute in history**.

All this information will bring a **profound change in education**. We will stop training individuals to be “teachers,” when all that most young girl “education” students really want to know is how are they going to earn a living in case they don't get married.

Much of the educational system today is aimed at answering: “How am I going to survive? How am I going to get a job? I must earn a living.” **This is the priority item under which we are working all the time - the idea of _having to earn a living_. That problem of “how are we going to earn a living?” is going to go out the historical window, forever, in the next decade**, and education is going to be disembarrassed of the unseen “practical” priority boogeyman. Education will then be concerned primarily with exploring to discover not only more about the universe and its history but about **what the universe is trying to do, and why man is part of it, and about how can and may man best function in universal evolution**.

Automation is with us, there is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to differentiate out experience continually and to articulate and develop new tools to do physically repeated tasks. Man is now no longer essential as a worker in the fabulously complex industrial equation.

Marx’s _worker_ is soon to become utterly obsolete. Automation is coming in Russia just as it is here. The word _worker_ describing man as a muscle-and-reflex machine will not have its current 1961 meaning a decade hence. Therefore if man is no longer essential as a worker we ask: “How can he live how? How does he acquire the money or credits with which to purchase what he needs or what he wants that is available beyond immediate needs?” At the present time we are making all kinds of economic pretenses and covering up this overwhelming automation problem because we don't realize adequately the larger significance of the truly fundamental change that is taking place in respect to man in universe.

As automation advanced, man began to create secondary or non-productive jobs to make himself look busy so that he could rationalize a necessity for himself by virtue of which he could earn his living. Take all of our bankers, for example. They are all fixtures; these men don't have anything to do that a counting machine couldn't do; a punch button box would suffice. They have no basic banking authority whatsoever today. They do not loan you their own wealth. They loan you your own wealth. But man has a sense of vanity and has to invent these things that make them look important.

I am trying to keep at the realities with you. **Approximately total automation is coming**. Men will be essential to the industrial equation but not as workers. People are going to be utterly essential as consumers - what I call _regenerative consumers,_ however, not just swill pails.

The vast industrial complex undertakings and associated capital investments are today so enormous and take so long to inaugurate that **they require concomitantly rapid regenerative economics to support them**. The enterprise must pay off very rapidly in order to be able to refund itself and obtain the economic advantage to inaugurate solution of the next task with still higher technical advantage. In that regenerative cycle of events the more consumers there are the more costs are divided and the lower the individual prices. The higher the frequency of the consuming the more quickly the capital cost can be refunded and the sooner the system is ready for the next wave of better technology. So, man is essential to the industrial equation as a consumer - as a regenerative consumer, a critical consumer, a man who tasting wants to taste better and who viewing realizes what he views can be accomplished more efficiently and more interestingly. The consumer thus becomes a highly critical regenerative function requiring an educational system that fosters the consumer's regenerative capacity and capability.

At present world economics is such that Russia and China work under an integrated socialist planning in competition with our literally disorganized economic world (for our antitrust laws will not permit organization on a comprehensive basis). The communists have high efficiency advantage because of their authoritarianism. We have very little centralized authority, save in “defense”. The communists now have the industrial equation, too, in large scale, and soon complete automation will be with them. They are very much aware of the fact that the more customers there are, the more successful the operation will be, because the unit costs are progressively lower. This is why the Soviets were historically lucky in getting China as customers. They would like also to have, exclusively, India and Africa as customers. If Russia acquires the most customers, we will not be able to compete. They will always have the lower costs on any given level of technology.

We're going to have to meet this possibility and meet it vigorously, swiftly and intelligently. Within the next decade, if we survive at all as an organized set of crossbreeding men on the American continent it will be because we will have suddenly developed a completely new attitude on all these matters.

In case you are apprehensive that the social and political economics are to be so laggard as to impede your advanced educational programming it is well to remember that comprehensive world economics are going to force vast economic reforms of industries and nations which incidentally will require utter modernization of the educational process in order to be able to compete and survive.

**Every time we educate a man, we as educators have a regenerative experience, and we ought to learn from that experience how to do it much better the next time**. The more educated our population the more effective it becomes as an integral of regenerative consumer individuals. We are going to have to invest in our whole population to accelerate its consumer regeneration. We're going to be completely unemployed as muscle working machines. _We as economic society are going to have to pay our whole population to go to school and pay it to stay at school._ That is, we are going to have to put our whole population into the educational process and get _everybody_ realistically literate in many directions. **Quite clearly _the new political_ word is going to be _investment_**. It's not going to be _dole_ or socialism or the idea of people hanging around in bread lines the new popular _regenerative investment idea_ is actually that of making people more familiar with the patterns of the universe, that is, with what man has learned about universe to date and that of getting everybody inter-communicative at ever higher levels of literacy. People are then going to stay in the education process. They are going to populate ever increasing numbers of research laboratories and universities.

As we now disemploy men as muscle and reflex machines, the one area where employment is gaining abnormally fast is the research and development area. Research and development are a part of the educational process itself. We are going to have to invest in our people and make available to them participation in the great educational process of research and development in order to learn more. When we learn more, we are able to do more with our given opportunities. We can rate federally paid-for education as a higher return, mutual benefit investment. When we plant a seed and give it the opportunity to grow its fruits pay us back manyfold. Man is going to “improve” rapidly in the same way by new federally underwritten educational “seeding” by new tools and processes.

Our educational processes are in fact the upcoming major world industry. This is _it_; this is the essence of today's educational facilities meeting. You are caught in that new educational upward draughting process. The cost of education will be funded regeneratively right out of the earnings of the technology, the industrial equation, because we can only afford to reinvest continually in humanity's ability to go back and turn out a better job.

As a result of the new educational processes our consuming costs will be progressively lower as we also gain ever higher performance per units of invested resources, which means that our wealth actually will be increasing at all times rather than “exhausted by spending.” It is the “capability” wealth that really counts. It is very good that there is an international competitive system now operating, otherwise men would tend to stagnate, particularly in large group undertakings. They would otherwise be afraid to venture into this great intellectual integrity regeneration

I would say then that you are faced with a future in which **education is going to be the number one amongst the great world industries within which will flourish** educational machine technology that will provide tools such as the individually selected and articulated two-way TV and intercontinentally networked documentaries call-up system operative over any home two-way TV set.

The universities are going to be wonderful places. Scholars will stay there for a long, long time: the rest of their lives while they are developing more and more knowledge about the whole experience of man. All men will be going around the world and do processes every day. Routine search and exploration and the world experiencing patterning will be everywhere. All students from everywhere all over the world is all part of the new pattern that is rushing upon us. We will accelerate as rapidly into yesterday through archaeology as we do into tomorrow. Archaeology both on land and under the sea will flourish equally with astronautics.

Anything that is static, forget it. Work entirely towards the dynamic. Get yourself the tools and ways of enclosing enormous amounts of space and make it possible for large numbers of human beings to come together under more preferred conditions than have ever before come together.

There are four kinds of privacy if I can't touch you, we're _tactically_ private. If I can't smell you, we’re _olfactorily_ private. If I can't hear you, were _aurally_ private. If I can't see you, we are _visually_ private. Just a little space will take care of the first three. For the 4th, since we can see great distance, all we need are delicate occulting membranes, possibly rose bushes or soap bubbles or smoke screens.

With general comprehension there will also come an entirely new way of looking at our mutual problems around the earth. We will not be easily influenced by ignorant persuasion and propaganda, such as pronouncements that “we are against this man and that man,” and so forth. We're going to look at our problems quite differently than we do now. There will be a coordinated comprehensive continuation of development of the child in appreciation of the sub consciously coordinate design of humans not forcing them into prolonged special focus yet accomplishing with automated tools and instruments far greater probing than was accomplished by the utter specialist while conserving the comprehensive comprehension of the significance to Society of the increasing flow of discovered data.

The new educational technology will probably also provide an invention of mine called the Geoscope.

THERE IS THE BODILY SELF, THE PERSPECTIVAL SELF, THE VOLITIONAL SELF, THE NARRATIVE SELF AND THE SOCIAL SELF.

INTEROCEPTIVE PREDICTIONS ARE ABOUT CONTROLLING THINGS GOING ON INSIDE OF THE BODY RATHER THAN FINDING THINGS OUT ABOUT THINGS GOING ON OUTSIDE THE BODY.

NATURE ALIGNS ALL LIFE: OUR PASSIONS, LOVE AND LIGHT CAN BE SHARED WITH EACH OTHER TO EMBRACE AND BRING BALANCED THRIVING FLOW, HEALTH AND POTENTIAL TO ALL LIFE.

SOME OF US ARE WIRED TO EXPLORE, QUESTION LIMITS / BOUNDARIES AND UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF HOW THINGS RELATE.

OUR FIRST RELATION IS WITH OURSELVES, OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR ATTENTION / FOCUS / DECISIONS AND THAT SETS UP FLOW TO INFLUENCE ALL OTHER RELATIONSHIPS.

EVERYTHING: ALL OF NATURE, ALL LIFE, GAIA, ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILD AND INFLUENCE CAN BE IN COMPLIMENTARY FLOW / THRIVING SIMULTANEOUSLY.

IF EVERYTHING: ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN FLOW WITH OUR SURROUNDINGS, THAT HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT WILL ALLOW GLOBAL HUMANITY TO SHARE INSIGHTS AND  STAY IN FLOW STATES PERPETUALLY WITH COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS MANIFESTING SYSTEM WIDE CASCADING BENEFITS.

WITH NATURE GUIDING OUR COMPASS - ALIGNMENTS OF OBJECTIVES AND INCENTIVES WILL PRODUCE FLOW UNLEASHING LIMITLESS CAPACITIES FOR EVOLUTION..

PLANET EARTH IS THE FIELD, HUMANS ARE THE TEAM, A REGENERATIVE FUTURE / MAXIMIZING LEARNING, EXPERIENCE, POTENTIAL AND FLOW FOR ALL LIFE IS THE GOAL.

USING THE PROVEN MODELS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PASSION OF SPORTS IN BREAKING THROUGH PERFORMANCE BARRIERS TO EXPAND HUMAN POTENTIAL IS HOW WE WORK TOGETHER TO EMPOWER ALL LIFE TO THRIVE.

IMAGINE THIS ENTIRE PLANET / ALL LIFE IN FLOW WITH POTENTIAL EXPONENTIALLY EXPANDING AND CROSS POLINNATING.

Connecting peak human performance / thriving / flow states with environment and infrastructure to empower the collective flow of all life into its optimal evolutionary potential.

Verses.io becomes the collective brain Omni tool in forming our collective sympathetic parasympathetic Gaia immune system with ever evolving optimally healthy practices.

Our interconnectedness becomes visible / experienced / interactive / shown as systemic with health compounding and cross pollinating resiliency.

 Add in the bliss / joy / fun factor to all of it and suddenly we can experience the way we can affect all beings / all things simply by being.

 The more love we are and the healthier we are the more we care for ourselves and each other - the entire system strengthens.

Resiliency and decentralized flourishing happen individually / regionally / collectively and we dissolve the illusion of separation.

We can remind all of our interconnectedness with each other in the world around us the planet and reality itself.

Our collective relational experiences shape our consciousness, co-create our reality, define what we perceive / believe is possible and create the world.

Before humans could be designed to occupy it, planet Earth had to be designed.

Before planet Earth could be designed, the solar system had to be designed.

Before the solar system could be designed, galaxies had to be designed.

Before special – case galaxies could be designed, special case macro-micro Universe, all it’s atoms and molecules, gravity and radiation had to be designed.

Before _any_ realizable designing was possible, it was cosmically necessary to discover and employ the full family of eternally coexistent and synergetically inter-augmentative, only-by-mathematical-equations expressible, inter-covarying, generalized principles governing the generalized design of eternally regenerative scenario Universe.

And before all recognition of the eternal generalized principles and their inherent design science functions, it was further necessary to have:

1. The design of an eternally regenerative, radiationally expansive and gravitationally contractive, everywhere and everywhen complexedly inter-transforming, non-simultaneously episoded, scenario Universe.

2. The generalized design of galaxies of entropic matter-into-energy as radiation-exporting stars and generalized star systems of planets serving syntropically, as radiation-into-matter importing planets.

3. The design of planet Earth as the Sun-orbiting, bio-sphere-protected, and oxygen-atmosphere-equipped incubator of DNA-RNA design-controlled biological life and that life’s photosynthetic conversion of entropic radiation into syntropic, orderly hydrocarbon molecules and a vast variety of hydraulically compressioned, crystallinely tensioned, exquisitely structured biological species omni-inter-regenerating as an ecological omni-life and human-thinking support system.

4. The eternal mathematics – numbering and structuring. The eternally extensive mathematical spectrums of frequencies, wave lengths, and harmonic intervals.

Only thereafter could those human beings progressively re-evolutionize exclusively by trail-and-error enlightenment, from their born naked state of absolute ignorance, to discover their scientific-principle-apprehending minds and thereby (now for the first possible moment in history) to glimpse humanity’s semi-divine functioning-potential as local-Universe critical-information-gatherers and local-eternally regenerative Universe.

Only now for the first time can we human beings effectively revolutionize society to fulfill what I have identified Critical Path as being the number one objective of humanity’s inclusion in comprehensive evolution.

The generalized principles have always – eternally – existed and have always been available for each special special-case, revolutionary design-realization. The special-case design revolution has always had to precede the extra-special case local social revolution, whether it be by inventing guns which overwhelm archery or inventing the wireless telegraph which transmits messages halfway around the world at six million miles per hour, making utterly obsolete the Pony Express and its concomitant “Wild West” socioeconomic behavior-patterning. The greatest evolution-producing revolutions are complex and take the longest to realize. “

----- R. Buckminster Fuller, Grunch of Giants – Pages 84, 85

The only happily promising recourse of each human individual this is to our highest intellectual faculties and their mutual, ego deflated, unselfishly loving preoccupation with comprehensivity and our employment of the most powerful tools of all:

(A)      the family of generalized scientific principles governing the operational design of eternally regenerative universe itself;

(B)      comprehending and effectively employing synergetics with the books Synergetics and Synergetics II presenting the comprehensive omni-image-able mathematical coordinate system employed by nature, thus avoiding the mentally debilitating, vast-majority-of-humanity-excluding quasimathematical coordinate system employed by present-day science;

(C)      comprehending the major objectives and operating strategies of the major opposing power structures of world politics, their present status quo and probable future trending;

(D)      comprehending the fundamentals of economics, of wealth versus money, of the principal features and functioning of industry, banking and securities;

(E)      comprehending the educational system in general as well as the discovery of the shortcomings of science, engineering, and education in general;

(F)      synergetically comprehending “what it is all about” as propounded in _Critical Path_ and this book, _Grunch of Giants_, and discovering what our options are to confront imminent race disaster; and

(G)      the individual discovery of God by a vast majority of human individuals - not the discovery of religions, but the discovery that each and every individual has an always-instantly-open, no intermediary-switchboard-authority-to-contend-with, no-interference-of-any-kind, direct “hot-line to God”: ie the weightless, non-physical, communication occurring teleologically between the differentially limited, weightless, nonphysical, temporal, special case mind of the individual human and the comprehensively integrated, macro-micro unlimited, weightless, eternal, generalized mind of God.

----- R. Buckminster Fuller, Grunch of Giants – Pages 90, 91

We are faced with an entirely new relationship to the universe. We are going to have to spread our wings of intellect and fly or perish that is, we must dare immediately to fly by the generalized principles governing universe and not by the ground rules governing yesterday’s superstitious and erroneously conditioned reflexes. And as we attempt comprehensive thinking we immediately begin to reemploy our innate drive for comprehensive understanding.

The architects and planners, though rated as specialists, have a little wider focus than do the other professions…. At least the planners are allowed to look at all of Philadelphia and not just peek through a hole at one house or through one door at one room in that house. So I think it’s appropriate that we assume the role of planners and begin to do the largest scale comprehensive thinking of which we are capable.

-----R. Buckminster Fuller, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth – Pages 58, 59

In its complexities of design integrity, the Universe is technology.

The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish compared to the elegance of non-humanly contrived regeneration. Man does not spontaneously recognize technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest as something he ignorantly calls nature.

----- R. Buckminster Fuller, Synergetics

Understanding we are part of a complex living system that evolved over cosmic eternity, frees us from shaping our lives around constricted maps and contracted mindsets that we have been convinced would avoid the wrath of missteps that pushed preconceived, molded-mind boundaries. Our individual fear of love / nature / interconnectedness has become our collective love of fear as we have turned limitations into societal norms and laws. Seeing our beautiful “Spaceship Earth” from space – inspired us to look at our existence as part of a incredibly complex, complimentary, systemic, interconnected and interdependent living support system. In navigating our collective evolution, we continually learned to develop tools and insights that extend our senses informed consciousness into a micro / macro / expanding in all directions world view, and discover living systems, creating deeper and ever more precise understandings of how we influence and shape the very systems that not only conceived us, but that we evolve with and co-create. Just as children can take the responsibility for the care of aging parents to shape the course of their transition from physical to metaphysical, we have matured in our world view and now have a chance to use the tools that have given us insights about life to avoid Ecocide and make the best of this incredible moment in evolution. Our ability to share what we have learned, in real time, to quickly and efficiently upgrade standards in all facets of our constantly expanding interaction with Universe is now, with AI and the Metaverse, empowering our collective awakening. Collective creativity and the power of LIFE is redefining what we feel is possible both individually and collectively, accelerating us into new realities and responsibilities.

Life has evolved in a healthy ecosystem. Experiences are transferred between generations. Trauma is transferred between generations. Fear is passed on and imbedded in people and places, scarring us with survival responses. Consciousness is a product of our entire body. We sense inputs through our eyes (sight), ears (sound), mouth (taste), nose (smell), skin (touch), bare-feet (connection to earth), hands (touch – feel), gut-biome (foods / micro-biome), heart (feeling, metabolic responses of circulation), nose / lungs (breath), etc.

We are driven to explore and explain the areas of life at the fringes of understanding: the frontiers of how physical matter and consciousness coalesce into reality.

Our existence is relational – our existence, our ecosystem, our bodies – everything is connected and selectively perceived.

Every one of us, brings our own perspective and perception to life and each other – we are constantly mixing, rebalancing and mixing again.

As each of us reflect Universe – we influence life and each other individually and collectively – we are made to mix and learn yet we try to train our potential into silos.

It is time to use current technologies to empower successful cross disciplinary teams, to connect and flow.

“Never forget that you are one of a kind. Never forget that if there weren’t any need for you in all your uniqueness to be on this earth, you wouldn’t be here in the first place. And never forget, no matter how overwhelming life’s challenges and problems seem to be, that one person can make a difference in the world. In fact, it is always because of one person that all the changes that matter in the world come about. So be that one person.” – **Buckminster Fuller**

### Misc Text 2 

“One and a half billion years ago, the planet’s only lifeforms were single-celled. Fermentation ruled the earth. Then an anaerobic bacterium engulfed an aerobic bacterium. In time the ingested bacterium’s capacity for feeding on oxygen managed to increase, by an order of magnitude, the amount of energy available to its anaerobic host. This accidental collaboration made possible the proliferation of multi-cellular life forms and eventually, tool-wielding hominids…”

“According to what is known as the endosymbiotic theory of biologic complexity… this is the reason we exist.”  [ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) ] 

 [https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Kaiser)/Unit_4%3A_Eukaryotic_Microorganisms_and_Viruses/07%3A_The_Eukaryotic_Cell/7.8%3A_The_Endosymbiotic_Theory](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Kaiser)/Unit_4%3A_Eukaryotic_Microorganisms_and_Viruses/07%3A_The_Eukaryotic_Cell/7.8%3A_The_Endosymbiotic_Theory) 

“That aerobic bacterium evolved into mitochondria, the organelles that fuel living creatures: the powerhouses of the cell…”

“They [Mitochondria] convert glucose and oxygen into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the primary cellular fuel. They also help produce the essential hormones – among then estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol – and regulate cellular proliferation and death,”

“…the rest of the body (brain, hands, heart, lungs, digestive tract) is merely an elaborate and sometimes clumsy apparatus for the nourishment of the mitochondria – that it is the mitochondria and not Homo Sapiens who rule and foul the earth. Our cardiovascular system, that fantastic and vulnerable machine, is essentially a delivery system for the oxygen they require. The mitochondrion is the creature and we are merely its husk, its fleshy chrysalis. A newborn’s first breath? That’s the mitochondria, calling the shots.”

Martin Picard’s work “straddles the departments of psychiatry and neurology. His specialty is mitochondrial psychobiology. “We try to understand the connection between mind and mitochondria.”

In a mostly sincere attempt to convey how little we know about the workings of consciousness, he said, “We have yet to disprove that our brains aren’t simply antennas, that all of our ‘thoughts’ and ‘memories’ don’t just come from out there.” He pointed out the window – “and that we’re not just ‘streaming’ everything.”

“The main distinguishing characteristic between a cadaver and a living, thinking, feeling individual is the flow of energy through the body…The cells are the same, but without the energy flow, it just and inert blob.”

“Mitochondria transform chemical energy into electrical energy, Piccard explained. “Communication and energy go together,” he said. “The organs and cells can’t communicate without energy. Cells talk to each other. The mitochondria, which used to be bacteria, talk to the gut microbiome. They are like cousins. Cells choose to do one thing or another, based on the energy available. Energy for cells is like emotions for a human, It causes them to make decisions that may not seem rational.”

“Mitochondrial DNA seems to be passed down from generation to generation exclusively by the mother; sperm contributes nothing. As a result, genealogists have been able to trace a matrilineal line from all living humans back to a woman in East Africa, our so-called mitochondrial Eve, born an estimated two hundred thousand years ago.”

“The human body is a social network,” Picard said. He compared it to an ant colony, in which every ant has the same genome but serves a different purpose, much in the way the organs do for a human being. “My working hypothesis is that mitochondria do a lot of the sensing and perceiving and integrating of signals. That they are the cellular antennae, or the little brains that receive, process, and integrate information.”

“Cells age faster if you expose them to stress. They burn energy faster. It’s as though cellular anxiety causes cells to breathe faster. They consume more oxygen. They’re wasting energy and we don’t know why.”

“If you mess with the mitochondria, people feel shitty,” Picard said.

Picard calls Mitochondria: “the coolest independent contractors on the planet.”

THE ENERGY PARADOX: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR GET-UP-AND- GO HAS GOT UP AND GONE – DR. STEVEN GUNTRY

Gundry enumerates seven “deadly” energy disrupters:

1)       Antibiotics

2)       Glyphosate – the main active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup

3)       Other environmental chemicals

4)       Overused pharmaceuticals

5)       Fructose

6)       Bad light

7)       Electromagnetic fields

“Thinking about all the inputs, their ubiquity, and the myriad unmappable consequences of their interactions, one may just sigh…”

“Picard’s purview was perhaps more descriptive than prescriptive. “Energetic constraints, energetic flow, and the forces that drive – these questions aren’t taken into account as much as they should be,” he said. “The way of the future is understanding personal energy flows. The last ten years of personalized medicine has been taken over by genomics. The premise is that if you can sequence it you’ll know whether you’ll get sick or stay healthy. That’s where all the money goes. It’s a lucrative hypothesis, but it’s doomed to yield incomplete results. The genome is static. Health is so dynamic.”

“People are somewhat gorgeous collections of chemical fires, aren’t they? Harold Brodkey wrote in the story “Angel” – “We are towers of kinds of fires, down to the tiniest constituencies of ourselves, whatever those are.”

“Your heart rate, like most of the body’s involuntary functions, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which has two components; the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic one. The former fires the fight – or – flight impulse; it activates when you experience stress, or excitement, or over-indulgence. The latter is the restorative impulse: “rest and digest”, “feed and breed”. The sympathetic system stimulates adrenalin, which dilates your pupils raises your pulse, opens your airways, and interferes with signals to your bladder (This is why fear can cause people to piss themselves.) The parasympathetic does the opposite – it settles you down. Ideally, these two systems achieve balance. You rev up, you calm down. You push, you heal. Heart Rate Variability [HRV] supposedly measures this state of this concord. Counterintuitively, higher variability is said to reflect greater balance, and better health. Low HRV correlates to a range of diseases and to earlier mortality.”

“Aim for more than five hours of REM and deep sleep a night – I have never met someone who isn’t leading a great life” – “Flip the Youth Switch” – Dr. Bob Arnot: [https://bionicoldguy.home.blog/2020/12/07/flip-the-youth-switch/](https://bionicoldguy.home.blog/2020/12/07/flip-the-youth-switch/)

“It is in deep sleep that you generate ninety-five percent of your growth hormones: “That is when you’re repairing the muscles you break down in the gym. For cognitive repair, it was REM sleep, the dream state that cleanses the brain. Chess players focus on REM.”

GRAVITAS PLUS: DO YOU SLEEP FOR LESS THAN 7.5 HOURS? WATCH THIS: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgI1AxIvyMw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgI1AxIvyMw)

Casey Means, Stanford / Whoop / Levels – “…cited a University of North Carolina study that found that eighty-eight percent of Americans suffer from some metabolic malfunction. That means one in ten of us is able to process energy the way our bodies are designed to,” she said. “It’s an epidemic. Our fundamental pathways have been hijacked by the Western diet and lifestyle. Disordered blood sugar is a big driver of most inflammation and chronic disease. It’s not just diabetes. Glucose variability can correlate with a variability in your subjective experience of mood. Glucose excursions on =, or glycemic variability or “spikiness” lead to oxidative stress (an imbalance in between free radicals and antioxidants), which over time damages the mitochondria.

**What’s happening in our cells is happening in our bodies and what is happening in our environment is happening in our cells.**

There’s a contradiction: we need energy to do more – but to get more energy, we need to do less of the things we are doing.

This particular energy crisis is, to the extent that it is more metabolic than imagined, may be as apt an indicator of ill health, on a mass scale, as, say, addiction and disease.”

“We like to think we have conscious control over our behavior, but the more we learn, the more we learn that is not true – we’re less in control than we’d like,” (Kevin Hall – Clinical Nutrition Lab – National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) Hall has been trying to understand how different sources of energy in our diet affect metabolism – what happens for example when we restrict carbs or fat. “The body makes huge shifts to accommodate calories in different forms. On a low carb diet the fat in your blood – triglycerides – stimulates the uptake and blocks the release of fat. Low fat, high starch – insulin plays that role. **The human body is like a vehicle that burns different fuels. It’s an incredible engineering challenge. The metabolism is a miraculous flex-fuel engine.** Diesel, ethanol, doesn’t matter in the short term. It will adapt.”

A recent study published in the journal Current Biology [ [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/home](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/home) ] determined that the body seems to adjust to a higher burn rate by becoming more efficient – especially with exercise. This is called “energy compensation” and is not yet well understood. [ [https://www.cell.com/action/doSearch?text1=energy+compensation&field1=AllField&journalCode=curbio&SeriesKey=curbio](https://www.cell.com/action/doSearch?text1=energy+compensation&field1=AllField&journalCode=curbio&SeriesKey=curbio) ]

Generally, when your body burns through energy less efficiently, you are likely to die earlier and have a greater risk of disease. An inefficient metabolic system is like a car engine you rev too high: it wars out faster.

Richard Maurer comes from a family of ling distance runners. In college, he was obsessed with calories in and out. He cited a study of elite cyclists. They rode hard on a stationary bike and, when their muscles were spent, were given water on one occasion and a sweet drink like Gatorade on another, both of which they spit out without swallowing. The water spitters lagged behind, in terms of subsequent wattage produced. The taste of sugar had apparently tricked the brain into releasing energy that it had been hoarding for other functions. “In some ways, the bonk is a perception.”

### Misc Text 3

It is time to empower collective flow by recognizing we have been controlled / manipulated by fears / emotions rooted in base survival mitochondrial / metabolic responses triggered to over-react to perceived scarcity: not enough food, air, water, warmth, safety, etc.

We are a multicellular organism with our collective biome in a constant state of mixing / balance / adaptation, voting on manifesting our perception of health / energy and ultimate, stealth control over our decision processes.

Disconnection from Nature has created destructive lifestyles / sickstyles / deathstyles that undermine the capacities of our minds and bodies to flow.

This is the time to remember that we are both part of Nature and enriched / empowered by Nature and all systems are continually rebalancing / evolving.

We can now move into optimal flow states to enhance survival and evolution by recognizing and consciously deciding to leave behind old thought patterns that have been trained by fear and trauma to operate in a shadow of our individual / collective potential.

We have been collectively, generationally, chronically disempowered – life experiences have been passed down generationally – generational transfer of trauma have accumulated to the point where the entire planet has PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).

This is the time for us to clean house / recognize that every moment is new, everything is connected, and the misconceived / erroneous baggage we have been carrying needs to be recognized and dealt with to empower ourselves and each other into flow states and a new, thriving reality.

This is the time to take responsibility for ourselves and the comprehensively nested systems we are a part of – shift into flow and co-create a reality that optimizes evolution for the future of Spaceship Earth.

With all the scientific insight into the state of flow consciousness, we can now make optimal decisions as we work in the physical and metaphysical mediums to optimally learn ways to align with them – to be informed by our interactions to rebalance in ways that respect and empower healing / thriving / optimal evolution of all parts of the system.

Fun, Joy, Love, Integrity, Flow and following Bliss are essentials that will insure we remain aligned with our purpose as we contribute our influence to optimally evolving life / Universe.

Wherever flow, creativity and passion are unleashed, we make incredible advances – from the horse and buggy to Formula 1 cars, from early flying machines of the Wright Brothers to launching the James Webb Telescope into the Space.

The legacy and Art of IMPOSSIBLE - beautiful examples of artistic, sculptural reflections and manifestations of human innovation and capacity are an inspiration.

Empowered by flow, we can apply our capacities to co-create and manifest solutions to any problem.

We can do anything; we can achieve the impossible – the key is what trains us to focus our potential in one area or another?

**Global funding of teams that pull off the “IMPOSSIBLE” – exemplified by the NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratories / James Webb Space Telescope / Canadian Space Agency / French Ariana Rocket Launch Teams and  teams – should be seen as an ongoing Research and Development investment that unlocks scientific insights and inspires engineering breakthroughs that improve the future of all life on Spaceship Earth.**

 Consciousness is foundational – there is no realm “off limits” to our physical human body – we can engage with waves at any scale, in any medium.

We can regenerate the natural systems we are a part of, take the idea of thriving health and longevity to new levels and bring the extraordinary focus, science and engineering we have invested into planet / life destroying weaponry and apply that same brilliance and financial investment to instead shift this planet to a level of flow, abundance, sharing and respect support all life and each other.

Everyone here, on this planet, in a physical body, at this time, is here because they have a role to play in an evolutionary transition to a new future that allows us to shift into a constant flow, continually manifesting and evolve our individual and collective potential.

We have instigated controls and governance that are counter to flow / seek to impose limiting rules on mixing / influencing when the laws of Nature require and depend on mixing to continually adapt / re-balance for optimal health.

We get out of the situation we have created by setting flow states as a standard in human potential and understanding best practices from those who have scientifically validated ways of aligning with the incredibly dynamic, self-correcting living systems we are a part of.

The planet has an immune system just like we do – our health and planetary health is one in the same – the optimal flow states are universally, comprehensively beneficial.

Reconnect with Nature – EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.

Focus on Flow, Health, Potential and Love: Restore all Natural Ecosystems until they once again thrive at the levels they evolved to prior to our exponential extraction / exploitation / population increase.

Rebalance relationships during restoration for optimal future health and the regeneration of healthy, thriving living systems in optimal flow.

Live and make choices that flow / restore / maintain / improve health / harmony of all life we share existence with.

By extracting from land / converting forests to fields for crop cultivation – we have removed the water filled soils / plants / bushes / trees / layered canopies which hold massive amounts of water.

Water has the highest specific heat of any substance, meaning it takes more energy to change the temperature of water one degree than any other substance.

Water held in the ecosystem – between the waters and plants, moderating temperature highs and lows on the surface of the planet – insulating us from dramatic temperature fluctuations / water phase changes from photosynthesis / evaporation / condensation created by interacting with the sun.

The Ocean interacts with all lakes, flowing waters, the sun and atmosphere to drive global weather circulation impacting all living systems on this planet.

We need to honor our springs, our sources of pure water.

We need to let our rivers flow undammed and allow the fisheries and global food distribution systems to operate and designed – as Tom Chi reflects, we must savor the photon and maximize diversified nutrient flows.

A Salmon starts as a tiny baby in the headwaters of a mountain stream, is carried out to sea where it ultimately grows by collecting nutrients and then fights back upstream to feed, die and distribute those Ocean nutrients to the wildlife that eats and distributes those collected Ocean nutrients to all life.

Migration distributes capacities around the globe in ways that may be difficult to recognize, until we step back and look at the big picture and appreciate systems interdependencies and interactions in new ways.

Nature is constantly adapting, in dynamic relationships that if not acknowledged, will get more and more apparent until action to remedy becomes necessary to avoid death or evolutionary remodeling.

Planet’s response to our collective actions is forcing us to take notice by moving those displaced by migration into the areas that still have a chance to act – those displaced bring their experience into the areas they are forced to migrate to, influencing those that still have the capacity to act because they are yet to be incapacitated by the environmental / societal catastrophes.

Living ecosystems have exceeded “normal” capacities of sequestering carbon: they will adapt and change, but this will alter the system to alter foundational elements in ways we may not recognize, altering our ways of life.

Living spring waters have exquisite structures that restore us – **HYDRATION FOUNDATION** / QUENCH (book) – Gina Bria

Consume mushrooms and take care of your gut biome – **ION GUT HEALTH** – Dr. Zach Bush.

Avoid carbonated beverages – they strip minerals out of your system (will dissolve the enamel off your teeth) that pure spring waters and unprocessed organic foods restore / nourish you with.

Avoid artificial anything – complex chemical reactions wreak havoc on our amazingly sophisticated, elegantly balanced bodies that were designed to thrive with pure, unadulterated inputs / ingredients.

Eat pure as our gut biome controls our health – manage diet by intermittent fasting.

Eat foods that are fresh, as local and unprocessed as possible and grown in healthy soil by people that care.

Include mushrooms and plant proteins in your diet.

If you want to eat fish – consider the sustainably raised **McFARLAND TROUT** created by William Bill Foss and Kenny Belove at FISH Restaurant / TwoXSea Sustainable Seafood Distribution Company.

If you want to eat meat – consider Bison / Buffalo – natural fed / free range / organic – bio-dynamically raised.

If you need healing to restore the natural balances of the complimentary systems that we are made up of, listen to your body – nobody is in a better position to know your body than you are – listen to your body / do not give away your power / responsibility.

Align objectives and incentives: pay / think / work for what we want to see happen – war is more profitable than peace, sick people are more profitable than healthy people, incarceration is profitable – we have the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, the medical industrial complex, the educational industrial complex, etc.

To understand who they are serving, follow the money / ask why we are perpetually stuck with the same problems in some areas of our existence while making dramatic process in others: if we can build weapons that can annihilate the planet in an hour for our “defense” from a political enemy.

Look through **Lil Sis** – (the alternate to Big Brother) a free data base of who knows who in big business and government: [https://littlesis.org/](https://littlesis.org/)

Now is the time to bring flow and foresight together to shift planetary decision making into collaborative cooperation with the focus on co-creating and sharing health, thriving and abundance for all life.

Now that we can see the problems in real time and track who has incentives to putting breaks on solutions – we can see why we are bleeding out - and it is time to act and achieve what **Steven Kotler describes in his book, THE ART OF IMPOSSIBLE – A PEAK PERFORMANCE PRIMER:** [https://www.theartofimpossible.com/](https://www.theartofimpossible.com/)

**VIDEO: HOW TO GET INTO A FLOW STATE BY STEVEN KOTLER**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG_hNZ5T4nY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG_hNZ5T4nY)

Change the actuarial data and insurance industries to align them with new business / infrastructure to empower a global regenerative economy.

Energy is flowing all around us - upon breaking on shore, wave energy converts to heat – it is our responsibility to understand how we should be aligning with the energies that make up the circle of life – if we go against natural systems / laws – we bring on ECOCIDE – our goal is to flow in harmony with the bio-mimetic solutions designed by Life.

**BIOLOGICAL RESONANCE – THRIVING IN A RADIOACTIVE UNIVERSE**: Author, Joseph Cerecedes

“To understand the universe is to understand yourself.

Your body. is composed of trillions of atoms, encompassing all of the elements, generated in the cores of countless stars.

Your body is a dynamic vehicle that interacts with various forms of electromagnetic radiation on a daily basis.

Every moment you are alive your survival depends on your body's adapted cellular ability to protect itself from and thrive in a radioactive universe.

‘Biological Resonance’ provides you with a unique insight and cutting edge understanding of how to stay healthy, youthful and happy in a world filled with increasing environmental hazards, whether it be UV rays from the Sun, heavy metals, parasites or natural and made man-made forms of ionizing radiation.

The biology of the cell is well adapted to survive and even thrive in such contaminated toxic environments.

Although we live in a world filled with various forms of energy that can tear atoms apart to their cores, life reassembles itself with time tested biological strategies.

Prepare yourself for a journey that will stretch the horizons of your mind and empower you with the knowledge of how to apply this new understanding in simple and practical ways in your daily life. Gaining an appreciation and an awareness of the unseen world happening all around you will change not just the way in which you view the world but fundamentally and forever change the way in which you interact with it.”

Dear Brothers,

Many of you ask me what we mean by “She Is Not Your Rehab” so I thought I’d put this list together –

1)       She is not responsible for your emotional rehabilitation.

2)       Your healing is your responsibility and yours to take initiative for and manage.

3)       Any healing needed for you, cannot come at the expense of her healing, health and wellbeing.

4)       She can support you but she can never do more for you than you are prepared to do for yourself.

5)       Regardless of what anyone has done TO YOU, it is now time FOR YOU to take ownership of your own life and be committed to living it wholeheartedly enough to do any work needed. Your childhood trauma wasn’t your fault but your healing IS now your responsibility.

6)       True change comes from genuine growth. Growth happens once we heal. Healing starts when we begin to FEEL our pain.

7)       Hurt people inevitably hurt people because what we will not transform, we transmit on those around us, and healed people do indeed heal people. The question is WILL YOU have the courage to heal?

She Is Not Your Rehab – and neither is he…. Matt Brown

DR. MATTHEW WALKER – THE SLEEP DIPLOMAT: [https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/)

Nature employs discontinuous compressions and continuous tension. For this reason, compressions are plural and tension is singular. That is, Earth and the moon do not roll around one another like ball bearings, The universe is cohered only by the continuous tensional integrity, which is sometimes magnetical, sometimes gravitational, and sometimes produced by forces as yet unexplained by experimental science.

And what has all this cosmology to do with woman in the twenty-first century? Answer: Just what it has had to do with women in all centuries – which is everything – as is manifest, for instance, in woman’s tidal flows geared to the moon phases. 

Women are tensional and continuous. Each new female as well as male life comes from the womb of the women. We have, then, the new female life as a series of expanding waves, the new ever emerging from within the older wave. Women are thus continuous, like the single-cell creature, Hydra – the newer part breaking off from the older with its early life overlapping its mother’s later life – ergo, never dying.

Males are discontinuous. The new male life is noncontiguous to the previous male life. Men are, then, islanded, individual discontinuities.

Woman’s nature is attractive, She employs tension, playing her male fish, as does a trout angler, on a long, invisibly thin flexible line whose slackening allows the male to play himself out while being gradually reeled in. The male is compressional – a spear-plunging hunter, impelling his missiles as intermittent punches, arrows, or bullets.

Twenty-first century woman will retain her tensional-integrity continuity and will yet cohere the universe, She will be extraordinarily attractive, but her metaphysical attraction will transcend her physical procreative attributes – though these will not have lessened. No longer will the medium be the message. What will count most is what she thinks about metaphysical, weightless you – man – and not what she feels about you physically. In this way she can and will be able to love you forever and you will be able to and will love her forever. Humanity will have verified immortality.

**“You cannot understand a system unless you change it.”     Kurt Lewin**

**“You cannot change a system unless you transform consciousness.”     Otto Scharmer**

**“You can’t transform a system unless you sense + actualize the emerging future.”     Otto Scharmer**

Energy is flowing through everything / everywhere. Consciousness, directs the power of thought metaphysically conceived / physically applied, influences energy, co-creating the pattern integrity we are a part of. Precision instrumentation that gives us new insights into the details of Macro / Micro realities empowered by AI makes the invisible visible in real time. Humans are now informed, beyond spectral limitations of sensory capacity, processing simultaneous multiple streams of physical / metaphysical reality to allow the most accurate shared system wide evidence evaluation we have ever been capable of. Individual / collective consciousness in flow, co-creating the future with new levels of depth, precision, interactivity and interconnectivity will allow us to make the best decisions we have ever made in aligning our evolution with cosmic reality. AI informs through multiple lens perspectives, aligning consciousness with nature and allowing for a new level of system wide decision making that will empower thriving system wide health to improve the potential of all life. At a time when “normal” is redefined daily, AI improves our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing planet with scientifically validated original people’s wisdom in real time to make decisions that generate optimal outcomes aligned with a regenerative future. Open source, living, geo-located AI opens us up to a new level of awe with the vastness of the web of life we are a part of directly and in real time: no educational or experiential gatekeepers influencing our curiosity with Ecocide creating preconceptions. We are free to explore Universe in flow, directly, without maps: the world is our classroom, and our curiosity can lead us where our unique perspectives are inspired to explore. Unencumbered by fears or trauma and empowered by flow, we are free to explore our unique relationships with universe and see how our personal perspectives weave into the web of life. Just as biodiversity adds resiliency to the web of life that collectively makes up the ecosystems that we are a part of, thought diversity will add resilience to our collective consciousness. AI allows humans to see where collective wisdom aligns to become net positive to nature and give us a chance to reverse Ecocide. AI empowers our individual and collective consciousness with globally shared baseline understandings of complex nested natural ecosystems so that we can manage decision making power in alignment with the energy flows of nature to cooperate in new ways and empower the regenerative future we need now. Engineers set objective standards of performance and learn from failure to improve our built environment – it is time we establish flow states as a standard for human potential and do the same with thought.

“Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system. If we discover the laws that govern this system and live synergistically within them, sustainability will follow, and humankind will be a success.” – **Buckminster Fuller**

Human Metaphysical Innovation has outpaced the physical legacy that has brought us to Ecocide. Our legacy of fragmented, segregated, siloed, colonization-based educational, financial, legal, economic, governance and military systems have been designed and orchestrated over hundreds of years of calculated secrecy and misinformation to control power, sensing, wealth, and life through imbedding perceptions of racism, scarcity, polarization, and fear as being facts of life. The push for power and profits has destroyed the Commons by concentrating human potential and resources on a global race of weaponry, power and control. Global human traveling and perspectives and capacities to share information instantly have now evolved the potential of human collective consciousness with the capacities to address the extinction / ecocide we have been led into and create a new, regenerative “normal” that will allow all life to thrive by creating livingry.

**Accurate, unbiased, unpolarized, real time systems wide knowledge of nature will provide insights that will help us make the optimal decisions at this critical point – here is what we can do and real time examples of what is being done:**

REVERSING THE TIDE OF ECOCIDE

**The Solution: An “Aware and Adaptive Nature Aligned Real Time Information Ecosystem for Sensory / Monitoring and Decision Making - Governance”**

We have the best tools to understand the environment we are a part of. Governance by nature is now a possibility. We have enough information about real time inputs / outputs / influence and past / present future modeling analytics to engage with living immune systems and how they collectively make up the immune system of the planet. Every life form is a sensor – with optimal ranges for health and function. We have the chance to govern our decisions and actions in alignment with Nature. Technology is a tool extension / precision - detail scope expansion (macro)  / contraction (micro) of sensory capacity / to understand our influences and what we are being influenced by. Geo-located insights shared transparently allows for adaptation optimization.  If we do not listen to the immune system of the planet, which governs the immune systems of all life, we create sickness, death and extinction, You get sick – you adapt behaviors for if you do not, you may die: don’t listen to the things that cause death and you go extinct – life is in context of ecosystem. We can for the first time in history reconcile our interconnected / interdependent “oneness” and our sovereign drive for freedom of our unique understanding of the experience of life in a physical body – allowing those insights to then influence our physical, spiritual and cosmic evolution. Digital consciousness can change and metaphysical speeds – Physical changes lag behind thoughts. There are various “gestation periods” between thoughts and realities.

**“Civilization is in a race between education and catastrophe. Let us learn the truth and spread it as far and wide as circumstances allow. For the truth is the greatest weapon we have.”                                                                                  H.G. Wells**

ECONOMICS

We should have Biome based currencies aligned with crystals (energy / intention), soils, seeds and ideas / Intellectual Properties.

Seeds turn into food or lumber – they are like growing real estate – incredible value.

Intellectual Properties can change the world – which we have experienced.

ADAPTABILITY

 “Normal” seasons and weather patterns are over. The world is a single, connected system with our global economy a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. We are witnessing borders dissolve due to environmental and geo-political influences. We can only avoid Ecocide by using technology to inform, educate and mobilize unlimited collective potential in real time to empower a relationship with life that is net positive to Nature. Aligning with the needs of Nature by utilizing the transparency and insights enlightened by the SPATIAL WEB / VERSES.IO will unlock planetary healing potential. We now have the information about planetary systems dynamics that align the global biome, resources and capital with Nature and evolutionary consciousness to inspire insights to flow into regenerative information, education, actions, innovation and investment at the speed of thought.

We support, and embrace the open, transparent, blockchain empowered spatial web in allowing, for the first time in history a validated exchange and sharing of system wide biomimicry based solutions and best practices between nature, science, engineering, and Indigenous / Original People’s wisdom-based learning that will establish transparent education and standards that regenerate the commons.

Our recognition of and visibility into comprehensively nested system interactions / stoichiometry of supply chain dynamics allow for the real-time monitoring of any influence, material or interaction going into or out of the system, and can be recorded, focused, observed, monitored and modeled at will, to any scale from micro to macro creating a geo-located, networked ecosystem that can highlight interdependencies, co-dependencies and living flows on demand. We will be able to precisely geo-locate insights from the core of our Earth, through our Ocean Depths, Geology, Water, Soils, Forests, Atmosphere, all Territories to the outer known reaches of Space and Cosmos.

New relational intelligence and collective transparency opens up the potential for system wide efficiency, alignment and health that was previously unimaginable. Our understanding of planetary systems and each other can allow us to do what has never been possible before. We can redefine “normal” and align our collective thoughts and actions with Nature to regenerate the commons. Just as the Spatial Web is rewriting drone security for major cities in the European Union, the transparency provided by a live digital twin of the planet will inform and affect every human influence in life, education and business. < [https://www.verses.io/press-archive](https://www.verses.io/press-archive) >

Real time transparency into the interactions of comprehensively nested systems will revolutionize understanding, decision making and drive the regenerative future. The relationship between environmental health and human health is clear: we share the same immune system. We can never be healthy if the environment we are part of is not healthy. Understanding living relationships in real time will change the way we treat them. With the collective realization of human potential to influence, effect, and allow the environment to thrive, we will change the nature of existence. Like all breakthroughs achieved by humanity, once we learn what is possible, we will be empowered and empowering. Freedom requires responsibility which is based on real time knowledge driving optimal decision making. Giving up lives, freedoms and finances to pay for safety from what we are misinformed to be afraid of will no longer make sense as we realize our descent into Ecocide and our way out.

Our current conditions are a result of our previous thoughts and the future conditions we collectively co-create will be the result of our decisions now. We are all connected. It is time for us to realize our potential to re-write the future and invest our lives and potential into our purpose inspired vision of what we want to see happen. This is our collective chance to empower a thriving future. We will shift from short term profits that are benefiting a few parasites to long term abundance that empowers all life. We will align incentives with objectives. The invisible will become visible, everyone will be awakened to reality and the new obvious will redefine what we consider normal, acceptable and ethical. Aligning our collective consciousness will make humans a team, Spaceship Earth will be our field and a bright future of evolution empowered by thriving, healthy existence will be our goal.

We are nature and the health of the environment and human health is one system. With the Spatial Web giving us insights into everything going into and out of any defined area, we have real time insights into what is working optimally and in harmony for the entire system and can get alerts for anything that would compromise the health and optimal pattern integrity of the entire system.

Insights into system dynamics will allow us to improve environmental health, human health, community resiliency, business continuity, economic stability and disaster preparedness. Seamless inter-communication of real time planetary monitoring will allow us to align and adapt our actions with the commons to insure we manage dynamics for health by operating within ranges that maintain healthy immune system interactions of all life on the planet.

Major economic drivers like science, innovation, real estate, asset protection, estate planning, financial technology, agriculture, food production and delivery, health-care, insurance, education, transportation, construction, infrastructure, education, work, security and global collaboration will all be aligned with nature by geo-located real time transparency.

Technology will empower our sensemaking with new levels of rapidly informed and understood dynamic relationships to precisely design contextual solutions – **impossible is over.**

**_The flow of consciousness into capital investment_**

**_is pivotal at this point in human destiny._** 

Consciousness creates reality. We become what we think individually and most importantly, collectively. An evolved “collective consciousness” aware of and aligned with Nature is not only critical to the future of humanity, but also a necessary condition for our survival. Consciousness is the re-examination and evolution of our very interface with existence and each other – integrity, self-examination, following our bliss in aligning with Universe / Nature / Life and Love – is how we evolve toward our individual and collective potential.

Unleashed, evolved consciousness will inform action and manage investment, regenerate the commons, build regenerative economies, and influence policies and governance in ways that will see those pillars of society become living, flowing, active partners and participants in the evolution of thriving, healthy life with unlimited evolutionary potential.

**_“Knowing is the enemy of learning.” – Tom Chi_**

**Unlearning & Relearning: What is Possible**

We are omni-potential problem solvers here on behalf of Universe and we learn through curiosity, exposure and experience. Our survival and ability to achieve our personal and collective potential in life is based on our ability to evolve and recognizing that our current reality is a legacy of misinformation and cultural programming. We have made extraordinary breakthroughs in certain areas and now, with planetary environmental insights in real time, we can bring our highest potential to all life. The way we have been relating to the planet, exploiting and manipulating the commons, life and each other over generations has shaped our ideas of what is possible and put us in this crisis of Ecocide. We must empower the recognition, dismantling and breaking through barriers when we learn that stuck system elements are at odds with and threaten our very survival. We need to change and let go of the old ways, the entrenched, practiced habits and programming of what isn’t working: we need to listen to Nature, empower our intuition by following our bliss, and give Nature a voice to heal the web of life we are both a part of and constantly redesigning by our thoughts and actions.

**Buckminster Fuller Inspired New World Game Technology as a Tool to make this possible – to inspire us to “shift from weaponry to livingry”:**
### An Enlightened Corporate Structure to Harness the Power of Profits

As a starting point we are considering: 

A Fuller / Enlightened corporation is a corporation whose membership interests incentivize green / blue / sustainable / regenerative profits. Membership interests in the enlightened corporation’s regenerative business are held by both employees and customers­. Employees get and grow their ownership interests by helping make and sell regenerative products that are **net positive to Nature**. Customers get and grow their ownership interests by buying regenerative products and referring (with digitally connected real-world, geo-located, interactions) to other environmentally minded consumers to buy the regenerative products that regenerate the geo-located ecosystem in the area of product use / the “**Commons”**. Employee and customer activity is tracked in real time on a corporate blockchain. The corporate blockchain allows employees to log their and their coworkers’ activity, and customers to log if they were referred by other customers. Participating employees and customers are rewarded with more membership interests. The membership interest structure empowers a real-time **“Regeneration Flywheel”:** more profit incentivizes more employee / customer participation in real time, which increases profit as well as making humans net positive to Nature. Membership interests are no longer held by non-participating ‘passive shareholders’ who are indifferent to environmental externalities. The Regeneration Flywheel would start with private corporations with environmentally friendly shareholders who vote to accept the membership interest structure described above. These private corporations will become the first Enlightened Corporations.

When these Enlightened Corporations demonstrate the Regeneration Flywheel effect, larger and larger corporations’ shareholders will vote to adopt membership structure enhancements to harness the Regeneration Flywheel for themselves.

The Regeneration Flywheel will ultimately be adopted by the world’s largest corporations that had previously approached market saturation and so view the Regeneration Flywheel as a new frontier for customer involvement and growth. Existing corporation’s pre-internet, off-blockchain share structures cannot support the Regeneration Flywheel’s real-time issuances of membership interests to participating employees and customers. As the Regeneration Flywheel spreads across corporations, corporate profit becomes net-positive for nature / the commons.

**Whole Systems Approach with Component Silo Revenue Streams**

All component silos while working globally, have complimentary geo-located / culturally aligned business plans that stand on their own

### Our Perspective Addresses

- Destruction of the commons is collapsing the immune system of the planet. As part of Nature, we are along for the ride we have co-created. The age we live in is called **_the Anthropocene Age_** because rather than being victims of random forces, we are now understanding that our thoughts, collective consciousness and actions have actually created our problems.  Humanity and our individual / collective consciousness is directly impacting and influencing living systems, health and survival causing mass out of phase extinction / Ecocide.

- Our transition from me to we consciousness is essential to our survival. We must overturn ignorant, dominant, fear based, disempowering ideologies that have convinced us to believe that Ecocide, war / murder, blind faith, waste, toxicity, pollution, genocide, poverty, antibiotics, stress, illness, starvation, terrorism and the ongoing destruction by extraction from the environment as well as the constriction of thoughts, freedoms and liberties are necessary, inescapable, “normal” parts of “success” and civilization.

- Aligning decision making and governance with Nature will align humanity in harmony with natural systems. Spatial Web technology will allow us to see and model dynamics live, in real time. The idea of normal is now an unknown and we can no longer rely on historical “normal” patterns in weather. Rapidly changing, in-flux chemical, temperature and pressure / force dynamics will make it essential to have the knowledge to explore and model options to adapt in optimal ways, in real time.

- Flow states / focused immersion are portals into alternate realities that align our unique pattern integrity with chosen engagement.

- **Humanity is in transition, taking an evolutionary step as it moves from a legacy of siloed physical reality to a future embracing the healing potential of networked metaphysical reality.** Like all breakthroughs in human potential, our fix must be **nothing less than a bold and courageous evolutionary step** in overturning the greed and scarcity-based, ignorance, fear and war machine power structures that have brought us to this crisis. We must recognize barriers: challenge and adapt the entrenched / subconscious dysfunctional thoughts, prejudices, habits, expectations, financial systems, economic models, policies, and destructive war machines that have become part of our belief systems and governance before we knew better. We have ignored planetary warning signs for decades and allowed “business as usual” to exponentially accelerate us and all life into this collapse of the commons / Ecocide which our disconnection from and disrespect of Life and Nature has created.

- The work of Dan Mapes (The Spatial Web / VERSES.IO) now **allows us to listen to the Earth / Nature with greater detail, precision, and sensitivity than our physical senses have been trained to believe is possible.** We can now make the invisible visible and learn instantly with processes unfolding in real time.  We have a windshield and dashboard for Spaceship Earth that is equivalent to “Mission Control” at NASA – to make decisions on the planet that respect natural flows to empower human existence in becoming net positive to nature.

- Leadership and governance revolves around and is shaped by global, multinational wealth that we perceive as driving the economy – the innovations and solutions for a regenerative economy exist today -- right now-- and **we need to align human opinion with Nature and scientific / engineering / materials science reality** in order to integrate solutions and share best practices at the massive, global scale necessary for optimal health of nested living systems insure Nature / We THRIVE.

- We will implement and utilize **Spiritually aligned, scientifically accurate, comprehensive accounting** throughout all systems, recognizing and scaling cascading benefits while eliminating cascading consequences.

- We will evolve our investments across all ecosystem / life services to align with and empower the **cascading benefits of biomimetic dynamics** inherent to the natural systems that sustain us – aligning humans with natural systems and forces.

- **We will understand how the immune system of the planet works**: our roles and responsibilities to insure human influences respect and support thriving, healthy ecosystems on a planetary scale.

- Every creator, consumer and geo-located interaction will serve to inform and educate global intelligence and insight into **a living, global Research and Development network that continually refines development and evolution.**

- Our efforts will **empower a regenerative economy** that naturally creates balanced, flowing self-perpetuating and optimally evolving constituents in a new relationship with nature which we call a **“Regeneration Flywheel”.**

- The **“Regeneration Flywheel”** will harness the power of profits from the regenerative economy to allow life and health to thrive and **shift us from short term “profits” to** **long term abundance**.

- **Systems thinking** will allow us to multiply complimentary, beneficial supply chain efficiencies and create resiliencies that will generate abundance and support a level of economic equanimity that will **raise the standards of living for all life to unprecedented levels**.

- All creators / consumers will be directly connected with geo-located references – creating a real time Research and Development network that speeds product development evolution

- All insurance actuarial data is shifted in perspective to a regenerative future – true risks are mitigated by comprehensive anticipatory design science

- Our connections with top global industries and brands will enable us to improve existing supply chains globally. **Instead of “starting up,” we are “blending in” utilizing the existing infrastructure** of existing brands: market share, supply chains, distribution networks, shelf space, stores, warranty services, shipping / receiving, warehousing, transportation, etc. We can improve the resiliency of processes and supply chains for existing companies with far greater efficiencies than starting from scratch.

- **We will revitalize global real estate** by showing real time connections between, ecosystems, lots, infrastructure, municipal services, governance, policy makers, underwriters, actuaries, insurance providers, lenders, owners, tenants, disaster preparedness and risk management.

- All businesses and physical spaces we work with will be looked at from **community resilience /** **disaster preparedness perspectives** so that they have the best chance of remaining operational during foreseeable disasters as well as being a community asset vs. an additional burden to first responders – creating new standards of community resiliency, business continuity and economic stability.

- Jobs will be everywhere as the interconnected interdependencies of our existence will thrive from the cascading benefits empowered by the loving care of individuals aligned with health and inspired by collective harmony for a thriving future.

Bow tie analysis has been in use for several years, with applications in both the upstream and the downstream process industries, as well as other major hazard industries. The method is qualitative and uses a diagrammatic representation of major accident fault pathways showing the hazard, threats, the top event, and all potential consequences, with intervening barriers and degradation pathways supporting the main pathway barriers. Bowties are sometimes defined as no more than a combination of Fault Trees and Event Trees stuck together, based on an assumption of linear causality behind incidents. Such an assumption is not, however, a necessary premise underlying the value of Bowtie-type analysis. They can be seen as a summary of the controls (barriers and safeguards) organizations rely on to protect against threats – whatever the causal mechanisms involved. The aim is enhanced communication of how major hazards are controlled. A problem has been that there is no widely accepted methodology definition and this has resulted in inconsistent diagrams, often with structural errors or showing too many barriers against potential threats.

CCPS along with the Energy Institute has developed a concept book to better define the bow tie analysis method and to show best practice ideas. The committee is composed of experienced practitioners from the upstream and downstream industries along with risk assessment and human factors consultants.

The book ensures consistent application of the bow tie technique by defining structural elements together with good and poor examples for clarification. For example, the book differentiates between barriers and safeguards to ensure controls are not overrepresented which may lull the workforce into a false sense of security that an event can never occur:

- **Barriers** are controls along the main threat and consequence pathway which should be independent, effective, and auditable, and on the prevention side fully capable of terminating the event on its own and significantly reducing the consequence on the outcome side. This is similar to an IPL in LOPA analysis. Active barriers which detect, decide and actuate elements should be displayed as a single barrier. For example 1 barrier: flammable gas ESD system rather than showing 3 barriers: gas detection, operator assessment, emergency shutdown.-

- **Safeguards** are controls along degradation pathways which reduce the holes in the swiss cheese and may not meet barrier requirements of being independent, effective and auditable. They are often human and organizational in nature.

The biggest area for inconsistency is the treatment of HOF - human and organizational factors. No current guidance addresses this topic well and the CCPS Committee developed novel guidance for this area. Human error should not be a direct threat. Human error should normally appear as threats for degradation pathways of a barrier and HOFs should be modeled as safeguards against those errors, as well as other threats. A multi-level bow tie approach is presented with the higher levels being the current main pathway and degradation pathways respectively. Then progressively new lower levels are introduced which show the safeguards supporting the degradation pathway safeguards. It shows important safeguards -such as safety culture, senior management engagement, recruitment screening, etc. that today are rarely shown in bow tie. The layered analysis highlights such controls that apply to many parts of a full bow tie analysis and avoids duplication. A case study shows its application to a tank overfill scenario.

Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound reveals the hidden power of sound in cinema and our lives through film clips, interviews, and verité footage. It captures the history, impact, and creative process of this art form with insightful, heart-warming and fun stories told by legendary directors such as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, David Lynch, Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford, Ang Lee, Sofia Coppola, and Ryan Coogler, and the sound artists with whom they collaborate. Few have “ears to hear” the emotional storytelling impact sound plays in so-called visual media. Francis Ford Coppola and Lucas both declare, “Sound is half the movie!” Spielberg says, “Our ears lead our eyes to where the story lives.” Audiences will discover unsung artists and key sound creatives - Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now), Ben Burtt (Star Wars), Gary Rydstrom (Saving Private Ryan), Lora Hirschberg (Inception), Cece Hall (Top Gun), Anna Behlmer (Braveheart) – who create magic for all the movies we love.

FORESIGHT INSTITUTE – NEUROTECH TECH TREE: BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE & WHOLE BRAIN EMULATION / VISION WEEKEND US 2021: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV8RnheF-yE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV8RnheF-yE)

Have you ever played Civilization? In the game, you’re discovering technologies that unlock new levels, one capability at a time. But not all innovations are equal. Better technologies of cooperation could unlock new levels of progress across the board.

CIVILIZATION GAME WIKI:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)

Opportunities for bright futures enabled by bio, nano, and computing technologies are now within our reach. Their proliferation also comes with risks and authoritarian attempts at control. Let's explore how cryptocommerce can enables decentralized, secure cooperation across human and computing entities.

How can web3 technology unlock a third path: a paretotropian future of high technology, intelligence and freedom?

This meeting is an interactive discussion. It is also the soft launch of a Substack book and book club on this topic, titled Gaming the Future: Technologies for Intelligent Voluntary Cooperation by Allison Duettmann, Christine Peterson, Mark S. Miller, Foresight Institute.

After briefly presenting the main ideas and technologies of the book, we'd love your ideas:

1. What tools can humans use to cooperate better? think prediction markets, DAOs, dominant assurance contracts, split contracts, zkps

2. What tools can humans use to defend against risks from nukes, bio, nanotech? think encrypted sousveillance, multipolar defense pacts

3. What tools can humans use to cooperate peacefully with AIs? think computer security, AI DAOs, principal-agent alignment

There is a theory that the Hopi took to their high mesa homes as a refuge from these more warlike people. An indication of this situation is that there is evidence that the Hopi first called themselves the Hopituh, or “the peaceful ones.”

[Uncovering the Roots of the Chumash People of Southern California](https://lajolla.com/article/uncovering-roots-of-chumash-people-of-southern-california/)

Long before there was the Hotel del Coronado, Hollywood, or Disneyland, Southern California was home to an indigenous population of people known as the Chumash. Researchers have uncovered many clues about the lifestyle of the people that lived along the southern coast. One thing scientists have not fully uncovered, however, is where those indigenous people […]

Logic is somewhat correct in that multiple waves of migrations in periods of unstable climate need not be assumed to travel only in one direction.   
  
Here is a peek into the fog of time immemorial. It’s Kumeyaay, or Kumia.  
  
It’s not Chumash or Chemehuevi which are Uto Aztecan. Kumia and Quechan are Hokan language group.  
  
Their sacred mountain is Avi Kwa’ Ame. Spirit Mountain. Near Laughlin, Nevada.  
  
This is the story how Wonderboy, Coyote and The Dreamer travel to what are now the lands of the Kumeyaay, Cocopah, and Quechan.

[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind)

The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind is a 1976 book by the Princeton psychologist, psychohistorian and consciousness theorist Julian Jaynes (1920-1997). The book addresses the problematic nature of consciousness – “the ability to introspect” – which in Jaynes’ view must be distinguished from sensory awareness and other processes of cognition.

SARA WALKER: RECOGNIZING THE ALIEN IN US: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWqVA0s5K3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWqVA0s5K3U)
- ARE WE ALONE?
- WHAT IS LIFE?
- HOW DOES LIFE ORIGINATE?
- Life does not violate any of the known laws of physics. But it is not explained by them either. In this SFI Community Lecture, Sara Walker guides us through the quest to uncover a new theory of physics that might allow us to understand what life is, its general characteristics, its origin on Earth, and how to find it elsewhere in the universe. Sara Walker is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist interested in the origin of life and how to discover alien life. At Arizona State University she is the deputy director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science, associate director of the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems, and associate professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Complex Adaptive Systems. She is also an external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.

- Now, in our time, these three rivers - anguish for our world, scientific breakthroughs and ancestral teachings - flow together. From the confluence of these rivers we drink. We awaken to what we once knew: we are alive in a living Earth, the source of all we are and can achieve. Despite our conditioning by the industrial society of the last two centuries, we want to name, once again, this world as holy.” -  Joanna Macy

- He has received The Courage of Conscience Award, the Parabola Focus Award, in addition to countless film awards, nominations, and accolades.

- Tobias did his PhD in the History of Consciousness at the University of California-Santa Cruz focusing upon comparative literature, and the psychology, ethnography and history of ideas and aesthetic orientations pertaining to human views toward Nature. Tobias has lectured worldwide and has held teaching positions at several universities, including Dartmouth, the University of New Mexico (where he once held the Garrey Carruthers Chair of Honors), and the University of California-Santa Barbara (where he was a Distinguished Visiting Professor of Environmental Studies, as well as a Regents Lecturer). Tobias is the author of over 45 published books -non-fiction, fiction, radical hybrids, plays, poetry, librettos - and the writer, director, producer and/or executive producer of well over 125 films, focusing primarily on ecological and humanitarian issues, both documentary and some drama and docu-drama, including the award-winning ten-hour dramatic miniseries, “Voice of the Planet”, starring William Shatner and Faye Dunaway, for Turner Broadcasting, and based upon Tobias' best-selling novel (Bantam Books, 1990) by the same title; and Tobias' hard-hitting 600 page book, and PBS documentary, “World War III: Population and the Biosphere at the End of the Millennium” (1994), the second, updated edition (1998) with a Foreword by Jane Goodall.

- Tobias' field-research has taken him to well over 80 countries, and from regions like Antarctica, to many of the world's deserts, temperate zones, tropics and Boreal forests.

- Tobias has been a mountaineer for many decades, having soloed hundreds of ascents, many of them "firsts" throughout the world. He has also specialized in alpine environments and mountain people, subjects of several of his books and essays, as well as one of his early films, "Cloudwalker."

- Tobias's films have garnered numerous awards throughout the past thirty years and played at countless festivals, as well as being broadcast in most countries of the world. His books and films have been translated into numerous languages, including Italian, German, Hungarian, Turkish, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic.

- For many years Tobias has been the President of the Dancing Star Foundation ("DSF") which works assiduously throughout the world in areas of biodiversity conservation, animal rights and environmental education. ([www.dancingstarfoundation.org](http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org "http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org")). Tobias' efforts - in collaboration with his wife, soul-mate, muse and professional partner/colleague, Ms. Jane Gray Morrison - include in situ and ex situ conservation, ecological restoration and animal protection at various refuges for wildlife and rescued animals in California and southern New Zealand (on Rakiura), and in many other regions of the world. Ms. Morrison is a global ecologist, author, filmmaker, and former opera singer. Together with colleagues and teams of researchers in dozens of countries, in addition to the United States, Tobias and Morrison have endeavored to better fathom humanity's impact on the Earth, in an effort to save lives - human and those of other species.

- Some of their DSF environmental educational work has resulted in such books and films as their 2011 massive tome, “God's Country: The New Zealand Factor,” with a Foreword by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) founder Ingrid Newkirk. The book has no impediments to readership: it can be downloaded for free - a 600-page examination of the economics, biology and ethics of nations, with 850 color photographs and several thousand footnotes. See: [https://dancingstarfoundation.box.net/shared/st72okcdfn](https://dancingstarfoundation.box.net/shared/st72okcdfn "https://dancingstarfoundation.box.net/shared/st72okcdfn")

- One of Tobias' and Morrison's latest documentaries is also downloadable for free, the three-hour “State of the Earth” available from Dancing Star Foundation,

- See: [http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/environmental_education.php](http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/environmental_education.php "http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/environmental_education.php")

- Another Tobias/Morrison literary/ecological collaboration resulted in the DSF book, “Donkey: The Mystique of Equus Asinus.” See: [http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/donkey.php](http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/donkey.php "http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/donkey.php")

- Dancing Star Foundation also recently re-released Tobias' PBS special, which he wrote and directed back in the 1980s, the first major documentary on Jainism, “Ahimsa: NonViolence.”

- See: [http://www.diamondmindinc.com/dsfstore.html](http://www.diamondmindinc.com/dsfstore.html "http://www.diamondmindinc.com/dsfstore.html")

- Two other recent major projects Tobias and Morrison collaborated on as part of DSF's global environmental outreach efforts are their PBS feature film documentary “Hotspots” - filmed throughout the world, and Hosted by their colleague Dr. Russell Mittermeier, President of Conservation International. See: [www.hotspots-thefilm.org](http://www.hotspots-thefilm.org "http://www.hotspots-thefilm.org"). The film focused on methods for saving endangered species and was filmed throughout Madagascar, Brazil, Peru, Chile (Easter island), New Zealand, California and Washington D.C. Hotspots  was the third in a trilogy of two-hour documentary specials for public broadcasting by Tobias and Morrison, the other two being “No Vacancy,” Hosted by world renowned population/family planning luminary, Bob Gillespie, and “Mad Cowboy,” Hosted by Howard Lyman, upon whose life story the film was based.

- Tobias's and Morrison's mammoth book, “Sanctuary: Global Oases of Innocence,” with a Foreword by Her Majesty, Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck, Queen of the Fourth King (Druk Gyalpo) of Bhutan, is a tribute to some of the many successful, indeed, heroic conservation efforts in twenty four regions throughout the world - from Suriname, the U.A.E., Bahrain and Yemen to Poland; from Alaska, California, New York, the Netherlands, France, and Portugal to the Indian sub-continent; from Namibia to the Eastern Himalayas; from Malaysia, Indonesian Borneo, Brunei, and Singapore to Japan, with nearly 900 color images, largely taken by Tobias and Morrison, and hundreds of pages of intimate text. See: [www.sanctuary-thebook.org](http://www.sanctuary-thebook.org "http://www.sanctuary-thebook.org").

- One of Tobias' latest novels, “Professor Parrot and the Secret of the Blue Cupboard” is a modern-day Doctor Dolittle, with 27 original works of art expressly created for the novel by artist Ms. Adonna Khare See: [http://zorbapress.com/?page_id=193](http://zorbapress.com/?page_id=193 "http://zorbapress.com/?page_id=193")

- In addition, Tobias's 25-year epic, the 1,836 page contemporary, Utopian saga, “The Adventures of Mr. Marigold,” first published in 2006 in New Zealand, with photographs by one of New Zealand's foremost photographers, Craig Potton - was re-released both in three hard-back editions as well as an ebook edition. Many consider it one of Tobias' most important literary works. [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6897048-the-adventures-of-mr-marigold](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6897048-the-adventures-of-mr-marigold "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6897048-the-adventures-of-mr-marigold") Some reviewers have called it not only the Best Book of the Year (2006) but the best book of the decade.

### Questions

- How do we create a world that is antifragile factoring increasingly decentralized exponential technologies? 

- What would it take to achieve effective global coordination such that humanity could do both long range comprehensive planning and factor new information with fast processing cycles?

- With the first fully globalized civilization, how do we avoid the collapse fate that has befallen all previous civilizations? 

- How do we do adequate safety analysis on radically unprecedented, complex, and consequential technologies like artificial intelligence and synthetic biology? Moreover, how do we bind the development of these technologies to those safety analyses and ensure that they are neither weaponized nor deployed negligently? 

- How would we best

	- Identify and internalize externalities in the decision-making process?

	- Identify and remove perverse economic interests systemically? 

	- Identify and remove (the basis for) corruption, without debasing creative agency? 

	- Bind predative power asymmetries where said asymmetries tend to confer the power to protect and advance themselves?

	- Account for types of value that are real but aren’t quantifiable, extractable, and exchangeable, in relationship to the types of value that are…factoring the relative power conferred by the latter type?

- How can we change the topology of incentive landscapes in the direction towards long term life enhancement?

- How do we close the niches for predatory behavior?

- How can we better bind wisdom and influence?

- Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science utilizing real time Spatial Web Sensitive AI to manage in / out supply chains allows us to create a thriving, healthy regenerative / resilient world: shifting from short term profits to long term abundance by factoring in and integrating the continually evolving tools that increase collective systems insights through decentralized exponential technologies.

- Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science informed by Spatial Web Sensitive AI will allow us to achieve effective global coordination so humanity can do long range comprehensive disaster preparedness planning and factor new information with fast / real-time processing cycles modeled for optimal regenerative outcomes.

- We are the first known fully globalized civilization that has a chance to glimpse our collective planetary consciousness and mobilize our potential to avoid Ecocide and shift to thriving health for all life. 

- Using thriving natural systems as a reference, we can use Spatial Web Sensitive AI to inform Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science and create radically unprecedented, complex, and consequential technologies like artificial intelligence and synthetic biology to optimize human relationships with the nested natural systems we are a part of.  Understanding and appreciating the cascading benefits of aligning with regenerative eternal natural systems will ethically bind the development of these technologies to those safety analyses and ensure that they are never weaponized nor deployed negligently because using them for livingry will be so clearly optimal.

- We will use AI informed Spatial Web Sensitive AI Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science to:

- Support systems thinking by identifying and internalizing externalities in the decision-making process.

- Build a thriving regenerative economy by aligning objectives and incentives with healthy, thriving nature: identify and systemically remove any perverse economic interests that cause ecological offense.

- Identify and remove the basis, incentives and attractions for corruption, without debasing creative agency. 

- Bind predative power asymmetries where said asymmetries tend to confer the power to protect and advance selfish interests that corrode, erode and destroy the Commons and cause Ecocide.

- Account for types of value that are real but aren’t quantifiable, extractable, and exchangeable in contexts of markets and in relationship to the types of value that are currently recognized…factoring the relative power conferred by the latter type.

- Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science will allow us to use Geo-Located Spatial Web Sensitive AI data informed by seamlessly integrated, hyper-aware / sensitive, precision AI to align objectives and incentives and change the topology of incentive landscapes in the direction of health and long term life enhancement unleashing tremendous biomimetically aligned cascading benefits and efficiencies.

- The combination of hyper precise transparency, contextual functionality, supply chain in / out insight close the niches for predatory behavior by using AI that is seamlessly informed by Spatial Web Sensitive AI.

- By aligning with Nature and empowering the world with real time, scientifically validated, Geo-Located Special Web Sensitive AI with the Knowledge of Original / Indigenous Peoples, we better bind Wisdom, Long Term Thinking and Relevant Regenerative Influence into an Engineering Based Specification Standards Upgrades for Global Solutions.

- Declines in the health and vitality of any natural system can be tracked to the root cause and become the most effective type of immune system response for financial and policy corruption in business / governance / policy systems that damage the commons.

- Transparent, open source, decentralized, Spatial Web Sensitive AI will manage and compare inputs and outputs to optimal models to develop collective intelligence that gets smarter per capita with scale.

 - Spatial Web Sensitive AI will disincentivize misinformation because any information not aligned with health will not fit into comprehensive models of regenerative model design: harming the information ecology and epistemic commons ultimately weakens the ability of our collective consciousness to manifest a thriving, regenerative future.

- Spatial Web Sensitive AI will collect insights into dynamic flows to inform the alignment of opinion with reality resulting in authentic virtue in people while disincentivizing virtue signaling by making it impossible.

- Geo-Located Spatial Web Sensitive AI data will immediately allow humanity to align opinions with reality and collective decision making with rapidly changing planetary system dynamics in real time to help us make it through what has been an increasingly multi-polar world, that is caught in economic extraction races as we near ecological limits of growth, empowered by increasingly catastrophic weapons and tools for increasingly effective widespread disinformation.


### Epic Fund FAQs

**WHY?** – Because the planet is dying – current efforts are too little / too late.

**HOW?** – We will stop Ecocide by harnessing the Power of Profits to support our Highest Technological Capacities, Natural Systems with Biomimetic innovation catalysts that will empower nature aligned cascading benefits that will scale a regenerative future through our networks of top global experts and brands.

**RISK?** – Our biggest risk is missing this opportunity to act and change.

**RESILIENCY?** – Our Systems thinking approach, based on Buckminster Fuller’s Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science thinking, is key to disaster preparedness / community resiliency / economic stability.

**TECHNOLOGY?** – We are working with Dan Mapes / VERSES.IO and will be using a three-dimensional spatial web interactive interface of the planet to view dynamics in real time to ensure our decisions create optimal cascading benefits.

**ADVANTAGES?** – With open source blockchain secured information shared in real time we eliminate the gatekeepers, give Nature a voice, and allow creators to interact with consumers globally to create a living, global R&D (research and development) network that empowers real time geo-located feedback to adjust product design for optimal ecosystem regeneration.

**DISADVANTAGES?** – None – we are disrupting Ecocide and the unsustainable belief systems / actions / behaviors / businesses / policies / governance that have caused our mass extinction.

**UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME?** – Yes – we recognize the value of all life, abhor out of phase extinction, and the businesses supported by our model will recognize the cascading benefits of improving consciousness and aligning with Nature, regenerating the commons and empowering community resiliency through designed in disaster preparedness / comprehensive anticipatory design science.

**GOVERNANCE?** – Transparency into regenerative supply chains will help humans redefine their relationship with Nature, restore the commons – and allow our social networks to function more like mycelial networks.

**MILITARY?** – We are seeing the military starting to engage with environmental services which will be the future as we transition as Buckminster Fuller inspired, from “weaponry to livingry.”

**THE FUTURE OF WORK?** – As human consciousness expands to embrace Nature, the health of all life will become a priority, empowering the potential of living / evolving capacities, creating with future generations in mind / building to last and the sharing economy will take root, sprout, bloom and thrive. Shared knowledge through ubiquitous technology and the use of robotics will radically alter our idea of work and future work will inspire people to follow their bliss, support them in realizing their potential and in doing so empower them to change the world. We will blur the line between vocation and vacation.

**HEALTH?** – Health care will become proactive / preventative – with incentives for the cultivation and maintenance of healthy commons as well as activities and habits built into our lifestyles. We recognize the advantages of aligning objectives with incentives, and using the model of Chinese Medicine – we will pay our care givers when we are well and stop paying them when if we get sick.

**INSURANCE?** – We will change the insurance business model which is using actuarial data to define risk and sell “peace of mind” to customers that do not know their risk. Insurance will be in place to inform, underwrite and educate, utilizing extensive archives of actuarial data bases to create safety net resiliency for foreseeable vulnerabilities until they are addressed by market available comprehensive anticipatory design solutions.

**POVERTY / HOMELESSNESS?** – Poverty and homelessness are a reality for everyone as environmental conditions displace communities globally. Lack of safety nets will be impossible as the true costs to society will become apparent through transparency. It will be obvious that UBI is profoundly more cost effective and economical than the current unsustainable practices which waste lives and human potential. The cascading benefits of investment into infrastructure and the commons will become obvious through accurate accounting. We will see the advantage of investment into “livingry”.

**WASTE?** – There is no “away” - we will focus on biomimetic ZERO-WASTE approaches.

**WATER / FOOD / AIR / SOIL?** – We will be looking at the health of our environment and life as one living system and at food / waters / air / soils as medicine and a way to achieve thriving, active, engaged longevity essential to the most expansive, evolution empowered future we can imagine. We will note Indigenous / Original People’s wisdom in caring for the environments that represent their physical and Spiritual territories.

**INDIGENOUS / ORIGINAL PEOPLES?** – We will recognize and correct previous injustices, honor silenced treaties and restore Sacred lands to Noble peoples.

**JUSTICE?** – “Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise, laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust. Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason, justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many. Therefore, in a just society the liberties of equal citizenship are taken as settled; the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests. The only thing that permits us to acquiesce in an erroneous theory is the lack of a better one; analogously, an injustice is tolerable only when it is necessary to avoid an even greater injustice. Being first virtues of human activities, truth and justice are uncompromising.” - "A Theory of Justice” by John Rawls.

**INCARCERATION?** – We will work with parents and children to insure families have the support to insure that all life and every child has the opportunity to reach their unlimited potential. We understand that all those working in the prison industrial complex are in prison too.

**MINING?** – We have experts that can decide on the necessity of any processes that pose risks to the environment and implement innovative regenerative options for extractive exploitation wherever possible.

**EDUCATION?** – The world will become our classroom. Enhanced by blockchain-supported transparency into every system in 3-D and real time. We will geo-locate in scale from a cell to the cosmos and have the capacity to dive deep into every environment to study and understand how life actually lives – providing an intimate understanding that allows love and care. The world will become our classroom as we have blockchain reliable data to monitor, model, design and guide our actions.

**FLOW: WHEN IS ATTENTION CRITICAL TO CHANGE?** – When surfing or riding a motorcycle on a road racecourse, everything you do in the moment changes your future experience. This is when life becomes a fascinating, relevant, critical flow state – there are many things you can look at, but a few things you must look at – this is when we must look at and take guidance from Nature.

### Cosmic Civilizations - From The Final Appeal to Mankind

Cosmic civilizations: Light, Gray and Dark – From THE FINAL APPEAL TO MANKIND – NICOLAI  LEVASHOV

The light civilizations adhere to the code of space laws following the basic tenants outlined below:

a) Each civilization has the right to choose its own path of evolutionary development, no matter what it might be.

b) Highly developed civilizations may render assistance to less advanced civilizations only if requested.

c) Highly developed civilizations are forbidden to terminate life even non intelligent life on another planet.

d) Highly developed civilizations are forbidden to apply any measures other than precautionary against members of the less advanced civilizations.

e) Use of violence against members of less advanced civilizations is permissible only if the latter’s action would lead to a major disaster. The extent of the violence should be kept at a minimum.

f) The use of holographic camouflage and deception is strictly forbidden and punishable. Penalties include nullification, that is, total obliteration of the spirit as well as of the physical body.

g) No civilization may perform experiments of possible detriment to another civilization without the latter's consent.

h) Highly developed civilizations are forbidden to transmit knowledge to less advanced civilizations that may be potentially dangerous to others.

i)Every civilization has a right to join a coalition or to develop independently.

Dark civilizations feel they are above all laws, recognizing only the law of might. They will do or use anything whatsoever to implement their ideas and achieve their goals.
## Action Items

- Create a PM Platform to manage inputs / share projects with the [[Team of Teams]]  
- Weave together relevant [[Teams]] (https://oduinn.com)  
- Identify and activate proven KINS networks with latest information and shared potential developing a global network of SME’s (Subject Matter Experts) that are in touch with the pulses of various ecosystems on the planet incorporating technical guidance, cultural guidance – with custom information designed to evolve cultures into cooperatives as efficiently and harmoniously as possible – with all networking balanced for strategic optimal alignment to, as Buckminster Fuller inspired, _“Make the world work, for 100 percent of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.”_
- Flow / invest $7M to support this global regeneration group effort. We will be the think tank (and/or work between for profit and ancillary non-profits), empowering a “radical action arm” that brings all of these solutions to global attention to stimulate thriving health and resilience into **the best investments ever made – shifting Earth to a regenerative future**
