# Summer Quests - A Simple Way to Get Moving Together
A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
*June 23, 2025*  

Beloved Friends and Fellow Travelers,

As summer unfolds around us, it offers a natural moment to pause, reflect, and intentionally step forward together.

We stand at a pivotal crossroads, increasingly aware of profound truths calling us into unified action. Amidst the complexity and urgency of our shared mission, clarity and decisive action can sometimes feel elusive. The good news? **The simple next step is right here.**

As [[Summer Quests Begin in Africa and Around the World]], your own Summer Quest is now beckoning.

## Why "Quests"?

Recognizing how challenging it can be to discern clearly [[What To Do]] amidst the overwhelming scale of our shared Mission, the [[LIONSBERG System]] revolves around focused, manageable, 90-day [[Seasonal Quests]]. Each Quest intentionally moves us forward Together along the [[Critical Path]] towards meaningful [[Milestones]] on the [[Way]] to our shared [[The Goal|Goal]].

A Quest is more than a mere task or project—it is a purposeful and meaningful journey, undertaken alongside a fellowship, circle, or team, toward outcomes of genuine significance and [[Value]]. Quests uniquely hold the power to transform our hearts, minds, and communities through dedicated, aligned action.

By organizing our collective efforts into clear, achievable Seasonal Quests, we transform complexity into clarity and overwhelm into inspiration. Together, these Quests cultivate resilience, unity, and momentum toward building [[The Future We Seek]].

## Why Circles? 

Because we can't—and shouldn't—do it alone.

The principle we follow is simple: **The Rule of Three**.

> _“When at least three committed people come together, powerful coherence and alignment emerge, greatly amplifying wisdom, creativity, and impact.”_

Circles provide mutual support, shared accountability, sustained motivation, and joyful co-creation.

As detailed in [[The Lionsberg Co-Creator's Handbook]], a Circle ideally comprises between 3 and 12–16 committed individuals. Often 4 to 7 is a sweet spot.  

## How It Works


1. **Join** LIONSBERG as a Member. (Via Link Below)
    
2. **Form or Join** a Circle (also called a Team, Fellowship, or Group).
    
3. **Choose and Embark** on one or more clearly defined Seasonal Quests aligned with the [[Critical Path]].
    
4. **Make Visible** your Membership, Circle, and Quest in The Directory.
    
5. **Share Regularly**—at least every 30 days, your Circle shares [[Stories of Transformation]] reflecting on experiences, insights gained, challenges faced, and the progress made toward your Quest.
    

This cycle of action, reflection, and sharing creates ongoing momentum, learning, and impact.

## Example Summer Quests:

- **Community Circle Quest:** Host or participate in regular gatherings that strengthen local relationships, build trust, and deepen shared understanding of the LIONSBERG System, Community, and Approach.
    
- **Resilience Garden Quest:** Create or expand community gardens or food forests, building collective skill, local food sovereignty, and ecological harmony.
    
- **Wisdom Quest:** Engage in reading circles, workshops, or dialogues designed to deepen awareness, foster shared insight, and enhance understanding of critical issues and transformative solutions.  
    
- **Youth Empowerment Quest:** Support or establish youth-led initiatives, mentoring circles, or creative programs designed to empower and nurture young leaders.  
    
- **New Members & Resources Quest:** Actively advance the [[Critical Path]] toward reaching [[The First Three Percent]] by developing outreach strategies, tools, and relationships to attract new members and resources.  
    
- **Mapping Quest:** Before embarking on something entirely new, undertake a local or domain-specific mapping Quest to discover existing initiatives, groups, and assets that might be supported, leveraged, or integrated.  
    
- **Decentralized / Open Source Technology Quest**: Discern key tools and technologies that the emerging LIONSBERG superorganism will need over the next two to three seasons, and begin designing and building the Technology Roadmap alongside the community.   
    

Wherever possible, ensure each Quest empowers both Lionsberg and your local communities immediately, cultivating essential skills, resources, and networks needed to successfully navigate the coming times.
