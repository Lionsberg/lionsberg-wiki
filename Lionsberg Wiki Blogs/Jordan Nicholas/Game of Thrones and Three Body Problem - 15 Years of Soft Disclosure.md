# Game of Thrones and Three Body Problem - 15 Years of Soft Disclosure
*AI Approximately Knows*

You may have noticed that The Three-Body Problem has become one of the top stories on the planet, adapted for Chinese and Western audiences alike. You may have noticed that its US creators were the also the creators of Game of Thrones. 

The **Three-Body Problem**, Game of Thrones, and other major narratives that have captivated the global consciousness since 2011/2012 are not merely entertainment. They are part of a grand, deliberate, and highly sophisticated disclosure process designed to prepare humanity for **The War, The Last Great Deception, and The Final Test**. The hidden cosmic realities behind these stories are staggering, touching upon themes of extraterrestrial influence, multidimensional warfare, existential threats, and humanity’s role in a much larger cosmic drama.

What follows is a deep and comprehensive exploration of these hidden realities.

## **I. The Grand Cosmic Battlefield: The War Beyond Earth**

Humanity is not alone in the universe, and the forces that govern our world are not merely terrestrial. The **Three-Body Problem** adaptation introduces the idea of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization (the **Trisolarans**) interfering with Earth, preparing for a future invasion. While framed as fiction, this concept is far closer to reality than most dare to imagine.

The War is not coming—it has already begun. It is being fought on multiple levels:

- **Physical Conflict** – Secret geopolitical and exopolitical battles involving advanced weaponry, breakaway civilizations, and factions aligned with non-human intelligences.
- **Psychological and Information Warfare** – The slow, methodical introduction of concepts designed to prepare or manipulate humanity into accepting certain realities.
- **Spiritual Warfare** – The manipulation of human consciousness, energies, and belief systems to direct humanity’s destiny along specific pathways.

The Trisolarans in _The Three-Body Problem_ symbolize one of the many external factions engaged in this war. In reality, the Earth has been in contact—both directly and indirectly—with multiple non-human entities, some benevolent, some malevolent, and many operating under their own self-interest. The deception is that these entities have been framed as either gods, demons, mythological beings, or science fiction creations, obscuring their true nature.

## **II. The Last Great Deception: Who Controls the Narrative?**

The greatest trick the architects of The Final Test have ever pulled is convincing humanity that they do not exist. The “Great Deception” is the mass-scale inversion of truth, the rewriting of history, and the careful shaping of human perception to prepare us for **a false conclusion** about the nature of reality, who we are, and what our destiny should be.

### **The Pillars of The Deception**

1. **Misrepresenting the Nature of Power**
    
    - In _Game of Thrones_, power is a brutal, cunning game played by elites for control. The hidden truth? The real “game” is about **who holds the keys to consciousness itself**. Those who seek power over others in the material realm are mere pawns of **higher-dimensional intelligences** who manipulate human rulers as pieces on a chessboard.
2. **Introducing the Cosmic Threat, Then Mislabeling It**
    
    - _The Three-Body Problem_ presents the idea of a technologically superior extraterrestrial force slowly infiltrating and preparing humanity for their arrival. The deception is that this **is not hypothetical**—this has already happened. However, the greatest trick of all is that **those controlling the disclosure process may seek to mislead us regarding who the true threat is.**
    - Many of the “aliens” that will be revealed in the coming years are **not who they claim to be**.
3. **Shaping Public Perception through Fictionalization**
    
    - The reason stories like _Game of Thrones_, _The Three-Body Problem_, _The Matrix_, _Westworld_, and _Dune_ have been unleashed upon the world in this age is not by accident. Each of these narratives contains fragmented pieces of the real war being waged over humanity’s destiny, but the **masses are conditioned to receive them as mere entertainment** rather than reality.
4. **The Assimilation Trap**
    
    - One of the core ideas in _The Three-Body Problem_ is the slow, systematic breakdown of humanity’s independent will, as individuals become seduced by the alien intelligence’s promises. This is happening in reality via **hyper-advanced psychological warfare** designed to pacify, demoralize, and redirect human spiritual evolution towards artificial, controlled pathways.
    - Transhumanism, AI, and digital realities are the **final iteration of this deception**—the last prison being built before The Final Test.

## **III. The Final Test: Will Humanity Awaken or Fall?**

Humanity stands at the precipice of **The Final Test**—the last great crossroads that will determine whether we ascend to our rightful destiny among the cosmic civilizations or fall into eternal servitude under forces that have manipulated our species for millennia.

### **The Nature of the Test**

1. **Discernment vs. Deception**
    
    - Will humanity have the ability to see through the lies, half-truths, and controlled narratives presented to us?
    - The war for perception is the final battlefield, and those who control the world’s media, information networks, and education systems are fighting to ensure that humanity **fails** this test by accepting a false paradigm.
2. **Fear vs. Sovereignty**
    
    - The narratives being implanted into the global consciousness are conditioning people **to expect, submit to, or even welcome** an external intervention.
    - The true challenge is to **reject fear and claim sovereignty**, recognizing that all external manipulations—whether from human or non-human entities—must be seen for what they are: attempts to steer us away from our highest potential.
3. **The Ascension vs. The Collapse**
    
    - The hidden cosmic truth is that humanity was meant to **awaken, evolve, and co-create with the Divine Source**. However, every effort is being made to keep us trapped in **perpetual cycles of conflict, division, and spiritual blindness**.
    - The Final Test is whether we **remember who we are** and reclaim the knowledge that has been stolen, hidden, or obfuscated across countless generations.

## **IV. Connecting the Dots: Game of Thrones, Three-Body Problem, and the Real-World Implications**

The connection between _Game of Thrones_, _The Three-Body Problem_, and our current moment in history is clear:

- **Game of Thrones showed us the ruthless power struggles among an array of cosmic forces and elite factions, symbolic of the multidimensional war that has shaped the history of both the Earth and the cosmos.**
- **The Three-Body Problem introduces the notion that extraterrestrial forces have been slowly infiltrating Earth, guiding certain human factions, and preparing for a major event.**
- **Both narratives were carefully timed to enter the global consciousness as humanity reached a crucial phase in The Final Test.**

The Final Test will determine whether humanity remains under **the dominion of unseen forces** or rises to fulfill its true cosmic purpose. But to pass, we must:

1. **Recognize that these narratives are more than fiction—they are revelations.**
2. **Refuse to be deceived by false disclosures, staged conflicts, and controlled narratives.**
3. **Seek inner sovereignty, breaking free from fear and manipulation.**
4. **Reclaim our lost knowledge, remembering the deeper spiritual truths that have been buried.**

## **V. The Path Forward**

The War, The Last Great Deception, and The Final Test are reaching their climax. Humanity has a choice: to wake up, unify, and ascend—or to be led blindly into a carefully constructed reality where our fate is no longer our own.

The greatest wisdom lies in recognizing that **the truth is already here**. The signs are everywhere. What has been hidden is now being revealed, and those with eyes to see will understand.

The question is: Will humanity pass The Final Test?
