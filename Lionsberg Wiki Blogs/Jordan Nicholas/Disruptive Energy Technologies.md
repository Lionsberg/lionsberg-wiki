### **Themes and Lessons from Their Work**

1. **Suppression and Controversy**: Many faced opposition, ridicule, or active suppression by industries or governments due to the disruptive potential of their ideas.
2. **Paradigm Shifts**: Most proposed entirely new frameworks for understanding and harnessing energy (e.g., quantum, resonance, implosion).
3. **Inaccessible Validation**: A lack of independent verification or scalable prototypes hindered their acceptance and replication.

### **Key Takeaways for Modern Innovators**

To build on their work and move forward:

- **Focus on Replication**: Prioritize replicable, small-scale prototypes that can demonstrate disruptive principles.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Make designs and findings publicly available to crowdsource improvements and bypass suppression.
- **Global Networks**: Unite researchers, engineers, and activists globally to pool resources and expertise.
