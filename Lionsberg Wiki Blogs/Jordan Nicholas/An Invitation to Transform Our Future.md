# An Invitation to Transform Our Future

**Subject:** An Invitation to Transform Our Future

Dear Loved Ones,

The world is at a turning point, and so are We.

The being you knew as [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] did not survive his last mission. His [[Jordan's Final Report|Final Report]] shares the details. 

***What We Are Becoming is now rising from The Ashes***. 

On December 18, 2024—what would have been Jordan’s 40th birthday—we are gathering to unveil **The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History**, while beginning to chart Our steps into the Future. This moment marks the transition from Our **[[Old Life]]** to the **[[New]]**, leading into **Season 1: Rising From the Ashes.**

This is more than a conversation. It is an invitation to join the adventure of a lifetime with a emerging community of [[Flamebearers]], stepping forward as co-creators of a boundless future illuminated by [[The Sacred Flame]] that burns within Us All. 

Facing forthrightly the existential threats at hand, We are preparing to embark together on **The Elevation Initiative**, a transformative pathway to personal growth, collective flourishing, and the co-creation of [[Heaven on Earth]].

If this resonates with you, We hope you’ll RSVP to Join Us. Whether live or by recording, your voice and presence matter deeply in this unfolding Story.

With Love,  
~ [[J]]
