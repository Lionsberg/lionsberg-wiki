# Above The Chaos, Sovereignty At Every Level

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

The core issue at the heart of so many others revolves around the exercise of [[Sovereignty]] and [[Authority]] on Earth. 

There are two competing Visions of the [[Future]]: 

One in which Sovereignty in vested in the abstraction of human (and spiritual) power structures... 

And another in which Sovereignty is vested in individual beings, and [[Ultimately]] in [[God]]. 

Over the coming years, it is likely that this [[Spiritual War]] will increasingly spill over into the physical realm. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] is one centered around the realignment of [[Sovereignty]], [[Power]], and [[Authority]] "[[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]", or in other words, United Under God. 

Under this [[Ethos]], individual beings, created in the image of God, enjoy [[Sovereignty]] at every level, as [[One Citizenship Under God]]. 

Every [[Individual]] and Locality would enjoy freedom and autonomy in every aspect of their existence, subject to [[Central Animating Spirit]] that makes diverse unity possible. 

In contrast, the existing trajectory is for power and authority on Earth to be increasingly concentrated among the [[Plurality]] of [[The Giants]], inevitably leading to chaos, authoritarianism, conflict, war, and [[Collapse]]. 

The Ultimate choice is whether to place a [[Unity]] at [[The Top]] of the Order, or a Plurality. [[Monotheism]], or [[Polytheism]]. 

What is the [[ONE]] thing that unites the [[All]]? 

And how does the [[All]] properly orient and order its self in [[Right Relationship]] to the [[ONE]]? 

These are the defining questions that will determine the fate of humanity for generations to come. 

The [[Way]] away from Hell and towards [[Heaven On Earth]] lies through rediscovering our [[Identity]], reclaiming our [[Sovereignty]], as voluntary reestablishing [[Right Relationship]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]] in a [[New Covenant]] as [[One Citizenship Under God]]. 

And being ready to forthrightly confront and overcome [[The Giants]] that guard the [[Land Of Promise]], who would readily enslave and destroy Us for their own [[Power]] and [[Profit]]. 

As we learned from the [[The Exodus]], those who shrink back in fear will not enter the land. 

Sovereignty is a matter of Spirit, not State. 

The Spirit of God is present in All Creation.
