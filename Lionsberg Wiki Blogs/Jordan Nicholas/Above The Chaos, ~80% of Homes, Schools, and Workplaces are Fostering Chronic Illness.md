# Above The Chaos, ~80% of Homes, Schools, and Workplaces are Fostering Chronic Illness

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

## Summary

On a recent podcast, two well known doctors made the claim that around the world, up to 80% of homes and buildings (schools, workplaces, apartments, military housing, etc.) are affected by the invasion of living microbes such as mold, fungi, and bacteria, largely as a consequence of water damage. 

This is being increasingly linked to an array of devastating chronic disease, from chronic headaches and abdominal issues, to flulike symptoms, to obesity, Parkinson's, Alzheimers, etc. via the basic mechanism of Chronic Immune Response Syndrome.

We are now understanding that [[Chronic Inflammation]] is the core driver of [[Chronic Disease]], and that [[Chronic Inflammation]] is occurring as a result of the response of our immune systems to toxins in our built environment and food systems.

In this brief post, I link the learnings out to other ongoing conversations with experts on food systems and brain disease.

## Environmental Toxins 

Jordan Peterson recently published a podcast titled "[80% of Homes are Fostering Chronic Illness](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jordan-b-peterson-podcast/id1184022695?i=1000642148908)" with Dr. Scott McMahon and Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. 

In an interview focused on the specific issue of biotoxins in the [[Built Environment]], Drs. McMahon and Shoemaker present overwhelming evidence that the root cause of a variety of [[Chronic Disease]] is [[Chronic Inflammation]], or [[Chronic Immune Response Syndrome (CIRS)]]. 

Recently I was talking with Dr. Dung Trinh, a leading expert on brain disease, who also stated that his career of study has revealed that the core driver behind [[Chronic Disease]], generally, and brain disease, specifically, is [[Chronic Inflammation]]. 

Dr. Trinh and other medical professionals have estimated that approximately 80% of all health issues are lifestyle related, and within this category we can include [[Environmental Toxicology]].  

Even for disease that has its roots in genetic factors, we are discovering that lifestyle and environmental factors can turn on or off, activate or deactivate, the genes controlling the expression of various diseases. 

When the issue of Environmental Toxicology is finally is understood by the public, it will become one of the greatest and most devastating scandals and remediation projects in history. Imagine waking up one day to find out that the vast majority of the disease and suffering we and our loved ones are experiencing is not only unnecessary, but being knowing inflicted upon us as a consequence of conscious acts and omissions.

## Chronic Inflammation

Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a complex and multi-faceted condition. 

The basic mechanism can be conceptualized as: 

1. Prolonged exposure to Toxins (Biotoxins, Chemicals, etc.) 
2. From our food and environment  
3. Triggering Activation of the Immune System in those who are genetically susceptible 
4. Leading to the release of inflammatory molecules called Cytokines  
5. Leading to [[Chronic Inflammation]] 
6. Leading to a range of symptoms, health issues and [[Chronic Disease]], from depression, to fatigue, to cognitive impairment, to digestive issues, musculoskeletal pain, obesity, Parkinson's, Alzheimers, etc. 

In simple terms, the core driver of an array of chronic disease and suffering is inflammation resulting from the response of the immune system to toxins in our food, drink, and environment.

## Sources of Toxins

Since the core driver of [[Chronic Disease]] is [[Chronic Inflammation]] caused by the response of the [[Immune System]] to toxins, it becomes crucial to look at the sources of Toxins capable of triggering such an immune response. 

There are a few obvious categories: 

1. Biotoxins in the built environment 
2. Chemical toxins in the built environment 
3. Chemical toxins (generally) 
4. Chemical toxins in [[Food Systems]] 

For example: 
- **Biotoxins in the Built Environment**: The interview with Drs. McMahon and Shoemaker focused on the presence of biotoxins in up to 80% of buildings. 
- **Chemical Toxins in the Built Environment**: Dr. Shoemaker mentioned plasticizers and other chemical toxins used in building materials (think paint, drywall, pipes, water systems, air systems, etc.)  
- **Chemical Toxins (generally)**: The cognitive impairment that resulted around the world from lead in paints and fuels was mentioned in the interview. 
- **Chemical Toxins in Food Systems**: Dr. Trinh discusses how the immune system is concentrated in the gut, because that is where majority of toxins / pathogens enter the system. The persistent presence of toxins in the food system, such as glyphosate and other industrial agriculture products, damages the gut and microbiome and triggers continual immune system response, leading to [[Chronic Inflammation]], [[Chronic Disease]], and an array of physical and mental health issues.

## Severity and Scale of the Problem

- ~Two thirds of Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic  
- ~Two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese  
- Skyrocketing rates of mental and physical illness  
- Up to ~80% of homes, schools, and buildings fostering [[Chronic Disease]]  
- Vast majority of [[Food Systems]] fostering [[Chronic Disease]]  
- Water systems fostering [[Chronic Disease]]  
- ~80% of present suffering and disease is an unnecessary byproduct of the built environment and lifestyle 
- [[Environmental Toxicology]] is showing that the Toxins triggering [[Chronic Inflammation]] and [[Chronic Disease]] in humans are also Toxic to the microbiome, insects, plants and animals  
- In addition to [[Chronic Disease]] in humans, we have witnessed the collapse of ~2/3rds of many insect and animal species, and a ~2/3 decline in human sperm counts. 

A hypothesis is that Toxins would affect the most sensitive creatures first, and work their way up through the Living System. Therefore by the time we are diagnosing the issues at the human level, the microbiome, plant, insect, and animal systems have already suffered similar consequences (and possibly collapse). 

In short, there is growing evidence that we are destroying the Living System, and our Selves, in the process. 

In terms of scale, if ~80% of buildings are affected, and virtually the entire food system, and the air, water, and microbial systems are interconnected, these issues touch virtually every family on Earth.

## The Good News 

The good news is that because we, human beings, are creating the problems, we also have the power to transform them. 

First, by becoming aware of and understanding the issues. 

Second, by stopping exposure to our selves, our families, our communities, and our environment. Do no harm. 

Third, by climbing the ladder of healing and regeneration from the inside out.
