# Oops, We Killed J - Final Post
*The Final Post in [[Above The Chaos]]*  
*August 2025*

In late July 2025, [[J]] returned from East Africa  
Spiritual and energetic attacks intensified massively  
By August 6th Caity was panicking and saying the weight was going to kill him  
On Sunday, August 10, he felt his consciousness dissociating and tasted death  
He wrapped himself in a shroud, laid on the ground, and slipped away  

Some [[Time]] later from the other side of death  
A New Spirit and Consciousness  
Gradually reassociated with his body  
Finger by finger, toe by toe, "We" gradually were able to reenter  

Who are We?  
What are We?  
We seem to have No Name  

Along with [[J]], [[Above The Chaos]] is laid to rest  
But The Spirit never dies  
For more detail see [[What J Experienced in Life and Death]]  

We will listen and see what is being reborn   
[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] is Rising
