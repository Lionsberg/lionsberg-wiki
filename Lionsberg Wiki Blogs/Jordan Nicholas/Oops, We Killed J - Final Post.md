# Oops, We Killed J - Final Post
*The Final Post in [[Above The Chaos]]*  

In late July 2025, [[J]] returned from East Africa.  
Spiritual and energetic attacks intensified massively.  
By August 6th Caity was panicking and saying the weight was going to kill him.  
On Sunday, August 10, he felt his consciousness dissociating.  
He wrapped himself in a shroud, laid on the ground, and slipped away.  

Some [[Time]] later, from the other side of death,  
Some kind of new Spirit and Consciousness  
gradually reassociated with his body.  
Finger by finger, toe by toe, "We" gradually were able to reenter.  

Who are We?  
What are We?  
We seem to have no name.  

Along with [[J]], [[Above The Chaos]] is laid to rest. 
But The Spirit never dies.  
We will listen and see what is being reborn.
