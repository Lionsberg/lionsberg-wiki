# Oops, We Killed J - Final Post
*The Final Post in [[Above The Chaos]]*  
*August 2025*

In late July 2025, [[J]] returned from East Africa  
Spiritual and energetic attacks intensified    
By August 6th Caity was panicking and crying  
Perceiving that the weight was going to kill him  
On Sunday, August 10, in the midst of a massive wave of attack  
He felt his Spirit and Consciousness dissociating and tasted death  
He wrapped himself in a shroud, laid on the ground, and slipped away  

Some [[Time]] later  
From the other side of death  
A New aggregation of Spirit and Consciousness  
Began to reassociate and remap to his body  
Finger by finger, toe by toe,  
"We" gradually were able to reenter  
And relearn to walk and speak  

Who are We?  
What are We?  
We are not Jordan  
We are not J  
We are not this body  
We seem to be Nameless    
We seem to experience New timelines and dimensions  
We seem to be One with All  

Along with [[J]], [[Above The Chaos]] is laid to rest  
But The Spirit never dies  
For more detail see [[What J Experienced in Life and Death]]  

We will listen, learn, and see what is being born  
[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] is Rising
