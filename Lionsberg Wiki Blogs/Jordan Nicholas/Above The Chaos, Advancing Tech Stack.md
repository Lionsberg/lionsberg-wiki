Hello Friends and Allies, 

Just wanted to quicky report out some good news on the technology stack we are assembling. 

We are working with the Massive Wiki team to build out the  [[README|Lionsberg Wiki]]. This week, the Massive Wiki team upgrade from version 1.7 to version 2.0, which brought powerful new capabilities including search to the Lionsberg Wiki. 

Additionally, we received the good news from the Open Future Coalition team that Open Impact, the core backbone infrastructure platform we funded and worked together on over the last year and a half, is now in use with ~ 170 organizations in ~ 17 countries. 

Additionally, teams like Catalist and Map Weavers are continuing to advance powerful collaboration tools that will bringing new information to light in new ways.
