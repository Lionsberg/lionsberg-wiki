# Above The Chaos, Co-Creating The Conditions For a New Sovereignty To Emerge

Hello Friends and Allies, 

In places like [[A New Sovereignty]], I outlined the hypothesis that what is trying to inbreak will result in higher order functional unity across boundaries, and become something like a new confederation / sovereignty composed of thousands of co-operating individual and local sovereignties. 

This 330 page [Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building]([https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf) from Rand provides a thoughtful analysis of the total set of conditions and order of implementation required to forge a functioning society on a small scale. 

It outlines the beginning of an order of priorities, or [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]], that must be established in Proper Order before a functional society can manifest itself. 

It might not be enough, but why should we think that anything less is required for Nation: Earth as a Whole? 

Why would we suspect that the whole of Earth should be treated with any less competence that any single domain would be treated with? 

Why would we suppose that we could do a less competent job organizing the activities upon [[Worksite Earth]] than we would do on any large scale program of action? 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a governance process as those found in the United States or the best examples in Europe and around the world. 

Seeing the corruption and injustice still present in even our best examples of democracy to date, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a coordination model as those found in a large nation or corporation. Seeing what is at stake, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a System to produce [[Throughput]] of our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] as any basic manufacturing or building System has. 

Seeing what is at stake, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

But how could those things ever be possible, with the Mountains that stand in the Way? 

Mountains are easy to move by Faith, and with Unity. If 8 billion of us simply decided to [[Act As If]] we were playing a [[New Game]], and faithfully bound our Selves to One, One Another, and All, and insisted on the [[New]] things, and refused to tolerate the [[Old]] things... 

...all things would be possible... exceedingly and abundantly beyond all we could ask or imagine. 

It might not be enough, but I have a reasonable idea of how we can accomplish this. It contains a thousand holes, and it requires your unique insights and help. Yet it is a [[Starting Point]], and [[It Might Work]] if we simply began and committed [[Get A Little Better Every Day]].  

"All" we have to do, is build a Philosophy, a Community, and a System, and a properly ordered [[Way of Being]], all defined and cohered by Love, purpose-built to create [[Throughput]] of the [[Work]] that must be done to accomplish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and solve the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]], all of which are part of one continuously improving thing. 

It is quite simple, but it will require a tremendous amount of discipline, courage and [[Work]] to get it done. 

Since there is so much [[Work]] to do, let's build a [[System]] to help us accomplish it, and ensure we input enough [[Energy]] and [[Resources]] required for it to operate. 

If someone has a better [[Starting Point]], I am all ears. In the meantime, we are full speed ahead co-creating the [[Lionsberg System]]. We need your help. The world needs you.
