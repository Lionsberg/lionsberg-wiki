# A Thousand Drafts Line the Wastebasket as Resources Dwindle

It is Sunday, March 9, 2025. 

Pinned down on the front lines. Under constant spiritual and energetic attack.   
Often struggling to keep my heart beating.  
Down to final few weeks of food, shelter, and basic provisions.  
Fighting a war for the future of civilization against forces few admit exists.  
Invisible beyond the arrogant ignorance the psychically and spiritually enslaved.  

We are pressed, but never Alone.  

I have drafted at least hundreds of letters requesting resources and assistance from those still temporarily safe within the collapsing luxuries of the Old World. 
Each has found its way into the wastebasket.  

I can understand how people suffer and die without ever asking for help.  

In Service of One and All, 

~ J
