Hello Friends and Allies, 

Last week we completed a milestone in a project I have long been curious about, which was to see whether we can provide to any human being in the world, for free, access to a world class education covering any topic, from pre-school through advanced college degrees. 

As a starting point, we created a 5 step network of steps: 

- **Stage 1**: English Language as a key to unlock all available courses  - free via Duolingo. 
- **Stage 2**: Khan Academy as primary curriculum for early childhood development (Khan Academy Kids) through early college / AP courses   
- **Stage 3**: MIT OpenCourseWare to access the entire curriculum from one of the top universities in the world for free 
- **Stage 4**: The Lionsberg System and Community as the culture and context in which individuals, organizations, and communities can help one another develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony  
- **Stage 5**: From this Starting Point, we can work together to continuously learn and improve all elements of the System  

We then began creating a [[Lionsberg Rosetta Stone]] that will eventually translate a simple welcome and description, to a language appropriate link to learn English, that then can provide access to the entire [[LIONSBERG System]]. We recognize the tremendous dangers and potentials of a system solely in English, so while for now it is the only realistic starting point, we will eventually encourage all the Wisdom, Knowledge, and Solutions to be locally and culturally translated. 

You can find the Starting Point here at [[Lionsberg Academy]].  Already this single link contains link to pre-school through MIT's entire catalogue, for free. 

This will ultimately be evolved significantly beyond academic learning and become a cornerstone piece of the [[Elevation Initiative]], whose purpose is to connect every individual, organization, and community on earth to the opportunity to develop into the fullness of their potential.
