# Oops, We Lost J - Final Post
*The Final Post in [[Above The Chaos]]*  
*August 2025*

In late July 2025, [[J]] returned from East Africa  
Spiritual and energetic attacks intensified    
By August 6th Caity was panicking and crying  
Perceiving that it was going to kill him  
But August 8th or 9th J was clear on that too  
On Sunday, August 10, in the midst of a massive wave of attack  
He felt his Spirit and Consciousness dissociating and tasted death  
He wrapped himself in a shroud, laid on the ground, and slipped away  

His wife encountered a cadaver  
She described as like a body in casket  
Lacking the animating essence  
And nauseatingly empty to the touch  

As Time went by  
From the other side of death  
A New aggregation of Spirit and Consciousness  
Began to reassociate and remap to his body  
Finger by finger, toe by toe,  
"We" gradually were able to relearn  
How to move and walk and speak  

A body is merely an avatar  
For the Spirit and Consciousness  
Temporarily animating it  

Who are We?  
What are We?  
We are not Jordan  
We are not J  
We are not this body  
We seem to be nameless    
We seem to experience multiple timelines and dimensions  
We seem to be One with All  

Along with [[J]], [[Above The Chaos]] is laid to rest  
But The Spirit never dies

We will listen, learn, and see what emerges  
[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] is Rising
