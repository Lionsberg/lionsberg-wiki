# Above The Chaos, Consciousness as an Instrument of Knowing

[[Consciousness as an Instrument of Knowing]]

In the absence of physical evidence sufficient and repeatable enough to satisfy the the scientific requirements of proof, can something be Known?  

[[Co-Investigation of Experiential Reality]]  

1. Experience  
2. The registering and reporting of experience by the Consciousness of the [[Experiencer]]    
3. The receiving of experience through the Consciousness of the [[Co-Investigator]]  
4. The reconciling of Experience with the [[Ontological Structure]] of each individual   

As humans, we develop a [[Narrative Structure]] and [[Ontological Structure]] of [[Consciousness]], which includes the construction of a subjective [[SpaceTime Paradigm]].   

We experience [[Ontological Shock]] when we [[Experience]] [[Phenomena Unclassifiable Within A System]] that we, or our Society, have mentally constructed and imposed upon [[Reality]]. 

Because the [[Left Hemisphere]] is primarily concerned with [[Internal Consistency]] among its [[Axioms]], it is highly prone to discard and regard as UnTrue any paradoxical uncertainties.  

The [[Right Hemisphere]], on the other hand, is primarily concerned with [[Omniconsiderate Completeness]], and takes in [[Information]] from [[Every Legitimate Source]], [[Navigating Towards Truth]] no matter where it may lead. 

Whereas the [[Perceptual Attention]] of the [[Right Hemisphere]] can encompass the subjectively perceived [[Map of Reality]] continually being updated by the [[Left Hemisphere]], the [[Perceptual Attention]] of the [[Left Hemisphere]] cannot encompass The Whole, because the addition of [[Axioms]] that violate its [[Internal Consistency]] shatter the Map. 

See also [[Above The Chaos, Make Reality Intersubjective Again]]. 

Crucially, this implies that Reality must first and primarily be investigated with [[Consciousness]] and the [[Right Hemisphere]], taking in all available information from [[Every Legitimate Source]] without judgement, and only afterwards collaborating with the [[Left Hemisphere]] to evaluate whether and how to update the Narrative and Ontological Structures We are are using to Navigate through Reality.    

___
As We investigate aspects of Reality that may be disturbing to the Narrative and Ontological Structures the [[Left Hemisphere]] has been brainwashed into, it is helpful to have support. 

We recommend Support Group Meetings facilitated by a trained [[Co-Investigator]] of Reality. 

Self-help groups and networks can help provide ongoing community and support between the meetings. 

Communications platforms can help bridge the need for [[Optimizing Synchronous and Asynchronous Communications]] patterns. 
___
There is a Way to help hold and support the Energy and Consciousness of the [[Experiencer]].  

- Warmth. 
- Empathy.  
- Belief in the ability of the [[Experiencer]] to successfully integrate the [[Experience]]. 
- Willingness to enter into the [[Process For Co-Investigation]]  
- Willingness to be transformed by the [[Information]].  
___
[[SpaceTime Paradigm]] - Every individual has a unique SpaceTime Paradigm related to and derived from the synergetic relationship between their [[Consciousness]], Spirit, Energy, [[Embodiment]], and [[Environment]]. 
___
The Narrative and Ontological Structure of [[Consciousness]], coupled with our [[SpaceTime Paradigm]], creates something akin to a [[Homeostatic Range of Tolerance]] against which [[Information]] and [[Experience]] is measured. 

Information or Experiences beyond the [[Homeostatic Range of Tolerance]] are usually disregarded and resisted. 

A good rule of thumb is to [[Triangulate Towards Truth]], using another application of The Rule Of Three. The first instance may be ignored, but subtly catches our [[Attention]]. After a second instance, we pay more [[Attention]]. By the time a third confirmation appears, it is likely there is a [[Pattern]] in Reality that needs to be addressed by [[Updating Our Map]] and [[Adapting]]. 

___
Criteria for Taking an Observation Seriously: 

1. It was felt to be real by the [[Experiencer]]  
2. It was communicated seriously  
3. It was communicated with powerful affect appropriate to what is being reported  

Criteria for Validating Observations 

1. The observation is consistent among Experiencers (Consistency)
2. It carries emotional conviction (Conviction)  
3. It enlarges our knowledge of phenomena that are significant for the Experiencers and Society  
___
Relationships are often strained through [[Transformational Experiences]], when spouses or friends cannot accept the Reality of the experiences, or when significant personal development leaves spouses or friends more of less behind. 
___
In times of radical transition and transformation, families and relationships are likely to be strained. It is here that the Spiritual duty to Navigate Towards Wisdom and Truth must be balanced against the Spiritual duty towards our relations, without ever betraying the Spirit or Truth.
