# Above The Chaos, Meditations

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]. 

Esteemed Friend,

I have been thinking and meditating on some things I find valuable, important, and perhaps even crucial to our ongoing survival as a species. 

I decided to begin structuring them in a Lionsberg Wiki Book called [[The Lionsberg Book of Meditations]]. 

There are 170 of them so far, I imagine there will be 1,000 or so in the future. 

I pray this effort will be of service to our journey. 

Blessings,
