# A Comprehensive Vision and Plan 

On its Quest towards flourishing and abundant life, Life and Society on Earth are facing a Meta Crisis. 

Over the next 7 years, dramatic action will be required to solve the grand challenges facing society, and forge the better future we all desire. 

Lionsberg has developed a comprehensive Vision and Plan of action based on deep analysis of the total nested hierarchies of problems, needs, and opportunities facing humanity. 

This New Vision and Plan has been coupled to $10s of millions of dollars worth of legal, governance, process, and technological infrastructure to enact it. 

We are now inviting individuals, organizations, and communities around the world to partner with one another to bring the Vision and Plan into Reality. 

___

If each and every one of the billions of families and millions of communities on earth were facing crises and opportunities of various types and scales, how could "we", as a human species, confront and overcome this chaos? 

We know that any top down or centralized effort to "manage" or "control" would fail. And yet we also know that our present situation requires that we work together and help one another at unprecedented scale. 

The Lionsberg System addresses this issue comprehensively through a system of infrastructure purpose-built to connect and empower billions of individuals, small groups, and projects in a variety of localized self-governing configurations. 

This Vision, Platform, and Plan is accompanied by a Prototype, constructed as a kit of interoperable parts, that contains within itself a continuously improving set of solutions to the problems, needs, and opportunities facing communities around the world. 

The result is that any small group in any community around the world that connects to the platform instantly gains access to a comprehensive pathway for every individual, organization, and community group to develop towards their potential and flourish.

## Challenges and Opportunities 

To evaluate the parts of the prototype, we synthesized comprehensive lists of the challenges and opportunities facing humanity and life on earth. 

As we look at the many challenges facing the world today, it can be overwhelming to consider the complexity and interconnectedness of these issues. From poverty and hunger, to conflict and environmental degradation, to corruption and injustice, it is clear that no single challenge exists in isolation. To effectively address these global challenges, it is critical to approach them from a systems point of view, considering the root causes and interdependencies that contribute to these issues. By understanding the bigger picture, we can identify key leverage points and prioritize solutions that address the underlying systematic causes rather than just the symptoms. This approach can help us to forge more effective and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of global challenges and work towards a more just and equitable world for all.

78. **Uneven distribution of resources, knowledge, and technologies**: The unequal distribution of resources, knowledge, and technologies can lead to imbalances in economic development and opportunities and can perpetuate inequalities between countries and within societies. Addressing these imbalances and promoting more equitable access to resources, knowledge, and technologies can be a key factor in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty and inequality.  
79. **Short-term thinking**: Short-term thinking, or a focus on immediate rather than long-term consequences, can be a major challenge in addressing complex global issues. It can lead to a lack of investment in long-term solutions and a failure to anticipate and plan for future challenges. Promoting a long-term perspective and considering the long-term impacts of decisions and actions can be important in addressing global challenges effectively.  
80. **Misallocation of non-profit resources**: The annual misallocation of hundreds of billions of dollars of resources within the non-profit sector, whether due to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, lack of knowledge, lack of coordination, or other factors, is preventing the private sector from achieving their shared goals and having the maximum impact. Ensuring that non-profit resources are used effectively and efficiently is important in order to address global challenges and achieve positive change. 
81. **Misallocation of government resources**: The misallocation of government resources, whether due to inefficiencies, corruption, or other factors, can prevent governments from effectively addressing the needs of their citizens and achieving their goals. Ensuring that government resources are used effectively and efficiently is important in order to address global challenges and achieve positive change.  
82. **Lack of systems thinking**: The lack of systems thinking, or the inability to understand and consider the interconnectedness of different systems and factors, can be a major challenge in addressing complex global issues. It can lead to a focus on individual problems or symptoms rather than addressing root causes, and can result in ineffective or even counterproductive solutions. Incorporating systems thinking into decision-making and problem-solving can be important in addressing local and global challenges effectively. 
83. **Unaccountable national and international bureaucracies**: National and international bureaucracies, or the administrative systems and processes of governments and other organizations, can sometimes be opaque, unresponsive, or unaccountable, leading to issues such as corruption, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency. Ensuring that bureaucracies are accountable and responsive to the needs of citizens and stakeholders can be important in addressing global challenges and promoting good governance.
84. **Disproportionate influence of national superpowers in international institutions**: The disproportionate power of national superpowers in international institutions, such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others, can prevent other countries from effectively participating in global decision-making and can perpetuate inequalities. Ensuring that the power and influence is properly balanced in international institutions is key to addressing global challenges and promoting equitable and sustainable governance and development for all communities. 
85. **Corruption of religious leaders**: The corruption of religious leaders by governmental and economic forces, who encourage them to use their positions of religious authority to unduly influence the thinking of the populations, can undermine the integrity of religious institutions and hinder the promotion of ethical values. Protecting the independence and integrity of religious leaders and institutions from outside interference can be important in addressing global challenges and promoting just and fair societies. 
86. **Supply chain challenges**: There are many challenges and issues related to supply chains that can impact their sustainability and effectiveness. These include environmental impacts, social impacts, lack of transparency and accountability, risk and resilience, and inefficiency and waste. Ensuring that supply chains are sustainable, transparent, and efficient can be important in addressing global challenges and promoting just and fair societies.

### Root Cause Analysis

Looking at a few root causes in more detail: 

1. **Structural inequalities and power imbalances**: Many global challenges, such as poverty, conflict, and human rights violations, are often rooted in structural inequalities and power imbalances between different groups or nations. These imbalances can be perpetuated by various factors, including discriminatory laws and policies, lack of representation and participation, and economic and social exclusion.
2. **Unsustainable systems and practices**: Many global challenges, such as environmental degradation and climate change, can be traced back to unsustainable systems and practices that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. These practices often rely on the exploitation of natural resources, disregard the impacts on people and the environment, and prioritize short-term perceived profit over the long-term well-being of communities and the planet.
3. **Lack of accountability and transparency**: Many global challenges, such as corruption and abuse of power, can be rooted in a lack of accountability and transparency within governments and other institutions. When these institutions are not accountable to the people they serve, or when there are no mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability, it can create an environment where power can corrupt, and abuse and misconduct can thrive.  
4. **Historical injustices and unresolved conflicts**: Many global challenges, such as conflict and forced migration, can have their roots in historical injustices and unresolved conflicts. These issues can be perpetuated by a lack of reconciliation and justice, and can have long-lasting impacts on communities and nations.  
5. **Limited access to resources and opportunities**: Many global challenges, such as poverty and lack of access to education and healthcare, can be traced back to limited access to resources and opportunities. This can be due to various factors, including economic inequality, discrimination, exclusion, and lack of international political will. 
6. **Short term thinking and lack of long-term planning**: Many global challenges can be exacerbated by a focus on short-term gains and a lack of long-term planning. This can lead to policies and practices that prioritize immediate benefits over the long-term well-being of communities and the planet, and can have negative consequences in the long run.  
7. **Disproportionate influence of special interest groups**: Many global challenges can be influenced by the disproportionate influence of special interest groups, such as corporations or lobby groups, on policy and decision-making. When these groups prioritize their own interests over the common good, it can result in policies and practices that are not in the best interests of society as a whole.  
8. **Misallocation of resources**: Many global challenges can be exacerbated by the misallocation of resources, such as when funds and resources are not directed towards the most pressing needs or when they are not used in the most effective and efficient ways.  
9. **Lack of wise, long-term systems thinking**: Many global challenges can be compounded by a lack of systems thinking, which involves considering the interconnectedness and interdependencies of different factors and their impacts on a larger scale. When decision-making is siloed and focused on individual issues or sectors, it can lead to fragmented and ineffective solutions.  
10. **Inequality and lack of social and economic mobility**: Many global challenges are rooted in inequality and a lack of social and economic mobility, which can lead to persistent poverty, discrimination, and other issues. When certain groups or individuals are marginalized or disadvantaged, it can limit their opportunities and prospects for the future, and can have negative impacts on society as a whole.  
11. **Shortages and mismanagement of natural resources**: Many global challenges are related to shortages or mismanagement of natural resources, such as water, land, and other resources that are essential for human survival and wellbeing. When these resources are not managed sustainably or equitably, it can lead to conflict, environmental degradation, and other issues.
12. **Lack of political will and wise leadership**: Many global challenges require political will and wise leadership to address effectively. When leaders are not willing to take bold action or prioritize the common good over narrow interests, it can hinder progress and make it more difficult to address complex issues.  
13. **Silos and self-optimization at the expense of the whole**: Many global challenges are perpetuated by a lack of collaboration and a focus on self-optimization over the common good. When organizations, governments, and other actors operate in silos and prioritize their own interests over the needs of the larger system, it can lead to inefficiencies, waste, conflict, and other issues. This can make it more difficult to address complex challenges and achieve systemic change.  

As we went deeper, tried to distill the list above into 3 deeper root causes contributing to all the issues above, and narrowed it down to the following: 

1.  **Structural inequalities and power imbalances**: Many global challenges, such as poverty, conflict, and human rights violations, are often rooted in structural inequalities and power imbalances between different groups or nations. These imbalances can be perpetuated by various factors, including discriminatory laws and policies, lack of representation and participation, and economic and social exclusion.
2.  **Unsustainable systems and practices**: Many global challenges, such as environmental degradation and climate change, can be traced back to unsustainable systems and practices that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. These practices often rely on the exploitation of natural resources, disregard the impacts on people and the environment, and prioritize short-term perceived profit over the long-term well-being of communities and the planet.
3.  **Lack of accountability and transparency**: Many global challenges, such as corruption and abuse of power, can be rooted in a lack of accountability and transparency within governments and other institutions. When these institutions are not accountable to the people they serve, or when there are no mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability, it can create an environment where power can corrupt, and abuse and misconduct can thrive.

As we went deeper, we determined that while it is difficult to identify a single "**deepest root cause**" that all global challenges can be traced back to, one root cause that could potentially be seen as underlying many global challenges is the imbalance of power and structural inequalities that exist in the world. 

In other words, the misalignment of power and authority on earth. 

This could include economic inequalities, social inequalities, and imbalances of power between different groups, nations, and institutions. When certain groups or individuals hold disproportionate power and resources, it can create an environment where they are able to shape policies and practices in their own interests, often at the expense of others and the whole. This fundamental misuse of power to benefit "self" at the expense of "all" can lead to a range of issues, such as poverty, conflict, and human rights violations, and can be difficult to address unless the underlying power imbalances are addressed.  

Therefore, the difficult ultimate realization was that a **realignment of authority and power on earth** was required, if in turn the other root causes were to be addressed and we were to come into **right relationship** with one another and our planet. 

It is important to note that addressing any of the root causes identified above, let alone the ultimate root cause, is a complex and challenging task that will require the efforts and cooperation of individuals, governments, organizations, and other stakeholders from around the world. We understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and that any approach would need to be tailored to the specific context and needs of the families, communities and countries involved. It will also require a long-term, holistic, and systems-thinking approach that considers the interconnectedness and interdependencies of different factors and their impacts on a larger scale. Ultimately, it will require a realignment of authority and power in order to address the root causes and address the global challenges we face.

It is also important to note that our current best understanding is that because of the Meta Crisis, time is of the essence, and whatever solution we come up with has to be able to be implemented within this decade, over the coming 7 years.

## Summary 

It is clear that we are facing a complex and multifaceted set of issues that require a comprehensive and integrated approach to address. These challenges include structural inequalities and power imbalances, unsustainable systems and practices, lack of accountability and transparency, historical injustices and unresolved conflicts, limited access to resources and opportunities, short term thinking and lack of long-term planning, disproportionate influence of special interest groups and oligarchies, misallocation of resources, lack of wise long-term systems thinking, inequality and lack of social and economic mobility, and a range of other issues related to health, security, the environment, and social and economic justice.

At the root of these challenges are a range of underlying causes, including poverty, inequality, lack of access to education and opportunities, environmental degradation, conflict and violence, corruption, and a range of other factors that create and sustain these issues. Many of these come down to structural flaws and imbalances in the way power and authority on earth are presently structured to benefit a select few, rather than the greater good of all. Importantly, however, these root causes also represent opportunities for change and improvement. By addressing these root causes, we can work towards creating a more just and sustainable society.   

It is crucial to recognize that these challenges must be tackled in thousands of diverse cultures and communities simultaneously, each of which is unique and will require localized solutions. Addressing the root causes of global challenges is a long-term and ongoing process that requires sustained effort and commitment from individuals, organizations, and governments at all levels. It requires collaboration and cooperation across sectors and borders, and the willingness to challenge and transform existing systems and power dynamics.  

A comprehensive and holistic Vision for the future is necessary to guide these efforts. This vision should prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, and recognize the interdependence and interconnectedness of different systems, issues, and challenges. It is only through a proactive, long-term, and ongoing process of transformation towards this shared vision and goal, guided by universal principles and values, that positive lasting change can be accomplished in this decade.

## A System To Bring Vision Into Reality

___
## A Comprehensive New Approach 

[[Work In Progress]] [[TKTK]] 

Given the scope and complexity of these global challenges, it became clear that a comprehensive new approach was needed. One that could address the root causes of these issues, rather than just addressing the symptoms. 

With this realization, we set out to design and build a new system that could address this fundamental issue, and in turn, help to address the other root causes and global challenges we face.

This new system, which we called the Lionsberg System, was designed to be adopted voluntarily by individuals and small groups, rather than being imposed top-down by large powers or institutions. We believed that by allowing people to opt in and adopt the system on their own terms, it would be more likely to gain widespread acceptance and success. 

The Lionsberg System was designed to be a holistic and inclusive system, one that takes into account the needs and well-being of all people, as well as the planet. It was designed to be fair and just, and to ensure that power and resources are distributed in a way that benefits the whole, rather than just a select few.

The Lionsberg System was also designed to be adaptable and flexible, able to evolve and change as needed to meet the changing needs of the world.

As we worked to design and build the Lionsberg System, we also recognized the need for a strong and effective governance structure to ensure that the system was implemented and managed in a fair and transparent manner.

With all of these considerations in mind, we set out to build a new system that could address the root causes of global challenges, and help to create a brighter and more sustainable future for all.

The Lionsberg System is made up of several interrelated components, including a new economic system, a governance framework, and a set of social and environmental policies and initiatives. It also includes a process for participatory decision-making and accountability, which ensures that all voices are heard and that the system is responsive to the needs of all stakeholders.

The Lionsberg System is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and to evolve over time as it is adopted and implemented by more and more people around the world. It is based on the belief that, with the right framework and approach, we can create a better future for all.

## The Lionsberg System 







____

We then began to synthesize a comprehensive set of solutions to unlock the opportunities hidden in each of these challenges. 



Therefore we are proposing a unique solution, which is to create a comprehensive list of the challenges and opportunities facing humanity and life on earth, consolidate the very best wisdom and solutions from around the world, and create a continuously improving Prototype, constructed as a kit of parts, along with a proven process for individuals and communitites to prioritize their own needs and implement the elements of the prototype that are most useful to them, in the order at at the time that seems most right and wise to them. 

This will give a billion small groups around the world access to the leading wisdom and knowledge from around the world, along with the tools, resources, and support to implement the very best solutions to their most pressing problems. 

Since there is no top down directive or mandate to implement anything, any element or solution that does not seem right and wise to the small group or community can be discarded. 

This will create a totally decentralized implementation that will prevent risks from propagating through the system. 

As groups around the world implement various elements of the system, they will begin to become interoperable with one another, and able to rapidly share resources and knowledge to help one another.

Rajasthan is the largest Indian state. It has a diversified economy, with mining, agriculture and tourism. Rajasthan has shown significant progress in improving governance and tackling corruption. However, it continues to face acute social and economic development challenges, and poverty remains widespread.  

What should local, state and national policymakers, donors, NGOs and businesses focus on first, to improve development and overcome the state’s remaining issues? Education and literacy? Women’s and children’s rights? Energy and the environment? Infrastructure? Health? Within each of these areas, there are many different possibilities. **With limited resources and time, it is crucial that priorities are informed by what can be achieved by each rupee spent.** 

Rajasthan Priorities, as part of the larger **[India Consensus](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/india-consensus)** – a partnership between [**Tata Trusts**](http://www.tatatrusts.org/) and the [**Copenhagen Consensus Center**](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/), worked with stakeholders across the state to **identify, analyze, and prioritize the best solutions to state challenges**. It commissioned some of the **best economists in India, Rajasthan, and the world** to calculate the social, environmental and economic costs and benefits of proposals.

Rajasthan Priorities engaged with institutions, NGOs, decision makers, sector experts and businesses from all parts of society, as well as the public through newspapers, radio, and TV.

After the groundbreaking new research was available on responses to Rajasthan challenges, we asked everyone - from Nobel Laureates to everyday citizens - to set their priorities for the state, sparking a conversation about **the most effective and efficient solutions for Rajasthan.**.

Top 10 Solutions: 

1. Computer assisted learning at the right level

Use educational software that adapts to students’ learning levels and pace, together with a teacher for 90 minutes a day. 5 months per student cost is ₹1300, for benefits in lifetime earnings worth ₹83,000.

2. Micronutrients for pregnant women at ANC visits

Provide vitamins and nutrients at antenatal visits. Health workers, training and supplements cost ₹88 crores annually, and would avoid more than a lakh of maternal anemia, and 1,400+ deaths.

3. Immunisation camps in lagging districts

Provide immunisation programmes in lagging areas, with a meal to encourage parents to attend. This costs ₹10 crores and could save 220 children annually.

4. Education for complementary feeding and hand-washing  

Counsel mothers to improve breastfeeding, complementary feeding, and hand-washing, to cut deaths from diarrhea. The cost per mother is ₹1,200, for benefits of ₹71,400.

5. Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease
