# Above The Chaos, Running The Play

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.02.08 _(updated 2024.02.19)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

## Introduction

Ok, after 7 years of concentrated preparation, my [[Current Best Understanding]] is that the [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] is upon us and it is time to run [[The Play]]. 

The [[Lionsberg Trust Manifesto]] and [[Lionsberg History and Inception]] detail [[How We Got Here]].  

I have simplified [[The Play]] down to a [[Critical Path]] that We, the individual citizens, control, with [[No Dependencies]]. 

It simply requires that enough people *believe*. 

## The Simple Logic  

[[The Play]] is simple. 

- We built a clean, independent new container with the systems and infrastructure to facilitate [[The Movement]] - [[FROM the Old TO the New]].  
- Over the next seven years, every human on Earth will be invited by someone they know and love to Join Us on our Quest towards [[The Goal]]. 
- Membership requires: 
	1. Invitation  
	2. Acceptance  
	3. Ongoing commitment to The Rules / Principles / Values that enable the new game to be played indefinitely into the future    
- After 3 years of membership and progress through [[The Lionsberg Experience]] (healing, transformation, and [[Quarterly Quests]] in small groups / teams), members are eligible for Citizenship.   
- Initial Target: connect and empower 3% of the world's population / 40 [[Cycles of Expansion]] / 267 Million People by 2026.   
## Cycles of Expansion 

We have mapped 50 [[Milestones]] based on cyclical expansion of [[The Movement]] along the [[Fibonacci]] sequence.  

To progress and succeed in [[The Quest]], the Players present in each Cycle must discern, embody, and enact whatever is required to reach the next Milestone, building the infrastructure, resources, and support as they go.

## How The Play Works 

Now that the [[7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] are complete and the [[7 Year Window of the Crisis and Opportunity]] is at hand: 

1. The Advisory Council will coach, advise, monitor progress, and help resource the [[Critical Path]]  
2. I will do my best to lead and inspire 
3. [[The Messenger(s)]] will speak, publish, broadcast, travel, inspire, and spread [[The Message]]    
4. Those who resonate will be encouraged to [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement)     
5. In February 2024, Jordan will invite a select few to become founding members of Lionsberg   
6. The **Lionsberg Members** in each Cycle will co-create and extend [[The Invitation]] to the Wise Right People, at the Wise Right Time, for the Wise Right Reasons, to [[Progress]] towards the Next Milestone.     
7. We will attempt to progress through the Milestones as quickly as possible without sacrificing [[Quality]] to [[Quantity]]  
8. The participants in each Cycle are responsible for self-governance, self-sustenance, self-replication, and discerning, embodying, and enacting whatever is required to [[Progress]] towards the next Milestone. 
9. [[Everything Is A Project]], and every Project is a Quest 
10. Quests are undertaken by self-governing, self-sustaining, and self-replicating teams   
11.  Teams spend 1/10th of their time and resources governing and coordinating the Whole 
12. Because [[The Means Are The Ends]], each Cycle must imagine, embody and enact the [[Way]] they would like the world to be, so that as we progressively invite [[All]] to [[Join Us]], day by day we are actively co-creating the [[New World]].  

## Baseline Actions For Every Cycle 

- Create a [[Plan]]  
- Perform a [[Retrospective]]  
- Issue a [[Request For Guidance]] to existing Players and Teams  
- Tell [[The Story]]  
- Extend [[The Invitation]]  
- Update [[Lionsberg History and Inception]]  

Additional items for continuous improvement: 
- [[The Messenger(s)]]  
- [[The Message]]  
- [[The Story]]  
- [[The Invitation]]  
- [[The Lionsberg Experience]]
