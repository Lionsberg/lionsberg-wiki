A post in [[Above The Chaos]]. 

As an independent candidate for President of the United States in 2024, I propose the following plan to address the most pressing issues facing our country and our world: 

1. **Vision and Values**: Without a shared Vision and structure of Values, we are perishing. I will work to restore a shared Vision of a better future for All, and reestablish the universal Values that are the bedrock of our union. 
2. **Engagement**: Divided against ourselves, we are failing. I will strive to help all people engage across the lines that have divided us in the past, so that together we can forge the better future we all desire. 
3.  **Wise Planning**: Without wise, written plans of action to get FROM where we are TO where we are going, we will remain lost wandering in the desert that stands between us and our Destiny. I will develop wise written plans of action to guide us as we advance towards our shared goals and values.
4.  **Agency and Action**: Without hope and a deep sense of purpose, meaning, and agency, far too many of us are sidelined and devoid of meaningful work and participation. I will equip and empower every individual and community with the agency, resources, and tools they need to develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish. 
5.  **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: I will work to help all communities continuously improve the quality of our vision, engagement, planning, and action to accelerate local progress towards our shared goals and values. 

With this comprehensive approach, I am confident that we can overcome the challenges facing our country and our world, and create a brighter and more abundant future for all. 

Together, we can build the safe, strong and united communities and world we all desire.
