Hello friends, allies, and co-creators, 

[[The Invitation, Cycle 9]] is live. 

Ideally, we will complete Cycle 9 and 10 in June ahead of the first [[Quarterly Summit]] in early July. 

Cycle 10 takes us out to the first 144 co-creators.

We are heading towards convening the first [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] in late September.
