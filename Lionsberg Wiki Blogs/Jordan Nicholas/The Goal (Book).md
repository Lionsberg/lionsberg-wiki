# The Goal (Book)

[[The Goal]] is a frequent theme that comes in writings about the [[Lionsberg System]].  

It is often association with [[Creator's Intent]]. [[Purpose]]. [[Intention]]. [[Aim]]. [[Goal]]. 

One of the best selling business books happens to share the same name. It is by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]], and it is based upon [[The Theory of Constraints]]. 

See [The Goal (Wikipedia Link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)).  

___

*"I have come to the conclusion that every action that brings a company closer to its **Goal** is [[Productive]]. Every action that does not is [[Not Productive]]."*

*"Productivity is meaningless unless you know what your **Goal** is."*  

*"And by the way, **there is only One Goal**, no matter what the company is."*  

___

In a holofractal Universe, the same could be said about any individual, tribe, civilization, planet, star system, or galaxy. 

"And by the way, **there is only *One Goal***, no matter what the ***planet*** is."

The Lionsberg System, Strategy, and Plan is [[Purpose-Built]] to bring [[The Goal]] into [[Reality]] in any [[Domain]] it is Incarnated. 

___
If [[The Goal]] of any [[ONE]] who Loves is to Co-Create [[Heaven]] for [[All]], an extraordinary cosmic opportunity opens up, whereby [[All Creation]] is invited to take up their unique [[SpatioTemporal Place]] and [[Functional Role]] in [[The Divine Symphony]] of Heaven. 

___

The function of [[Consciousness]] in [[Universe]] is to explore, expand, expound, and bring forth that which Its Source desires or intends. 

This requires an [[Ever Deepening]] [[Understanding]] of: 
1. **Who** the Creator ***Is***, and therefore **What** It Intends to **Be**
	- *[[Creator's Intent]] is not intellectual; It arises from the [[Character]], [[Nature]], and [[Essence]] of the [[ONE]]*    
	- This is [[Point B]]—[[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]  
2. **[[What Is]]**, in contrast to the Better and Higher Ultimate State that is Intended 
	- This is a function of wisdom, discernment, and analysis  
	- This is a core function of the [[Scientific Endeavor]]—consciously gathering and structuring information and knowledge about Reality  
	- This is [[Point A]]—[[Where We Are]]  
- The **[[Way]]** to **[[Progress]]**—FROM [[Where We Are]] TO [[Where We Are Going]]. In other words, the Way to Progress towards **[[The Goal]]**. 

It requires the [[Ever Deepening]] ReUnification of [[Apparently Individuated Consciousness]] with its [[Source]], the [[Ever Deepening]] ReMembrance of [[What Is]], and the [[Ever Deepening]] [[The Quest to Become and Co-Create Heaven|Quest to Become and Co-Create Heaven]].  

___
The statement: 

*"Every action that brings an organization closer to its **Goal** is [[Productive]]. Every action that does not is [[Not Productive]]."* 

...is conceptually, philosophically, and technically equivalent to saying something like: 

*Every action that produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] creates [[Value]]. Every action that does not is [[Waste]].*   

____
When the [[Lionsberg System]] incarnates in a Domain whose inhabitants are Ready... 

It brings to them, usually for the first time in their History or Conception, an [[Overarching and Uniting]] Way to rise into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] and [[Co-Create Heaven]]—Right Where They Are. 

[[Who We Are Becoming]] as We engage in [[The Quest to Become and Co-Create Heaven]] ensures that We will experience it [[EveryWhere And EveryWhen]]. 

By ***Becoming*** the kinds of Conscious, Enlightened, Co-Creative Beings Who [[Bring Heaven to Earth and Beyond]], We ensure that We will be able to experience ever more of Heaven across ever more lifetimes and Apparent SpatioTemporal Expanses. (*We say "apparent", because of course We are aware that [[SpaceTime]] is a relative illusion born of Who, Where, and When We Are.*)

[[Becoming By Doing]]  
[[Doing By Becoming]]  
___

To Manifest [[The Goal]] of [[Heaven on Earth and Beyond]], We must [[Progressively Transform]] Our Selves—including every [[Apparently Individuated]] Soul on Earth: 

***FROM*** the [[Old]], insufficient, present [[State of Being]]...
***TO*** the [[New]], higher, Intended [[State of Being]].  

Although We are already [[Perfectly Imperfect]], We Love Our Selves and One Another far too much to remain **Who and Where We Are**—plagued by suffering, scarcity, and injustice, immeasurably below Our Ultimate Potential, Intention, and Goal.  

Notice that [[The Goal]] appears to be interchangeable with both the Highest Intention and the Highest Potential. 

Is that not [[The Goal]] for any One We Love? To Help them develop towards the fullness of [[Potential]] and flourish in omniconsiderate [[Right Relationship]], [[Harmony]], [[Coherence]], and [[Flow]]? 

[[Heaven]] is therefore a State of Being in a Domain where All things are helping One Another rise towards the fullness of Potential and Flourish. It is an already perfect State and Place, that continues to get [[A Little Better Every Day]] as All its inhabitants harmonize in [[The Divine Symphony]] [[That Causes It To Be So]]. 

It is for this reason that it has been said that [[The Kingdom of Heaven]] is *within*. 
___
So let us fire up the assembly line, and begin moving Our Selves, one at a Time: 

***[[FROM the Old TO the New]].***  

If We put the [[Lionsberg System]] to use, We can move Our Selves quickly.
