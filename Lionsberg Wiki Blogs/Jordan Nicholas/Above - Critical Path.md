# Above The Chaos, Critical Path 

In Critical Path, Buckminister Fuller lays out a brilliant historical synthesis. 

## Speculative Prehistory 

In the beginning, [[God]] is generating an eternally regenerative [[Universe]]. 

Universe is without beginning or end. 

Universe is ordered according to a [[Logos]] that contains a set of generalized principles that govern its ongoing co-creation. 

Universe is a complex adaptive System, composed of complex adaptive systems, a [[System of Systems]], or a [[Living System]]. 

Earthians are hydraulically designed technologies, with biological life generally composed of over 50% water. 

Water freezes and boils within close limits. In all other places humanity is presently aware of in the Universe, the water we are composed of would be either frozen, boiling, evaporated, or incandescent. The unique terrestrial [[Biosphere]] of Earth is essential for the ongoing survival of [[Life]]. 

Before the continental networks of concrete highways commenced in the 1900s, human civilization strung itself out along the brooks, rivers, ponds, lakes, seas, and oceanfronts. 

Water gains and loses heat more slowly that any other known profusely available substance. This thermal stability keep the biospheres temperature changes at a minimum so that life does not freeze or burn to death. 

Humans, born into the world naked,  helpless, hungry, thirsty, curious, and ignorant likely emerged into the world in a comfortable environment that could support their development. With life composed of water and humans dependent upon it, they became natural hydraulic investors, forging ditches, canals and containers to hold water, and dug-out log vessels to exclude water from within. 

Fuller's theory is that Darwin had the facts in reverse, and that the diverse array of specialized life progressively evolved from the complex through various arrays of simplicity and specialization, rather than through the progressive agglomeration of single cell organisms. Fuller posits that this process may have occurred through the intelligent in-breeding of specialized organic equipment, and outbreeding of general adaptability organic equipment. 

Earthians are composed of the atoms of the 94 or so naturally regenerative chemical elements, in similar proportion to the relative abundance of those chemical elements in Universe. 

Each structure and being on Earth is a complex of complex systems, each dividing Universe into: 
1. Universe outside the system 
2. Universe inside the system 
3. The small bit of remaining Universes which comprises the system that separates the [[Microcosm]] from the [[Macrocosm]]. 

Fuller deals with the difficult subject of infantile undernourishment dulling minds of those deprived of proper gamut of chemistries (nutrition), as well as the distribution of melanin and carotin in humans and plants to filter the sun's rays, with hardwoods displaying color variation across a spectrum of darkness from the white oak at the far north, to the black ebony at the equator. 

Fuller reiterates the evidence that there is neither race nor class differentiation of humans, who are all of the same family, with all physiological differentiation in appearance arising as a consequence of multi-generations of unplanned inbreeding of the characteristics of those that survived most successfully under the unique bioregional conditions within which tribes and nations dwelt for protracted periods. 

Over the course of the developmental history of life on Earth, a series of ice ages has occurred, during which more of Earth's water is frozen, which greatly lowers the ocean level, revealing previously hidden interconnecting land masses. Alaksa and Siberia connect, and the islands of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Phillipines, Sulawesi and Bali become integral parts of the Malay Peninsula. During previous ice ages, the expanding ice mantle drove animals from the North  southward into the new peninsular extensions of the Asiatic mainland. As the ice age withdrew, meltwater refilled the oceans and seas, once again isolating the islands which where now inhabited with wild animals. 

At great mountain altitudes in places such as the Himalaya range, temperatures were lower and the ice caps remained, creating massive frozen reservoirs whose melting produced great rivers, enabling travel and settlement inland and upland. 

At some point, perhaps two ice ages ago, humans on horses headed North, eventually reaching Europe, where they had then had to endure the next ice age in caves in nonglaciated Western Europe, eventually losing their sun-ray-filtering skin pigmentation through successive generations. 

Fuller created a map showing the then 4.4 billion people on Earth distributed by population, with each of 100 dots representing 1% of humanity, 44 million humans. The map illustrates the remarkable concentration of over 50% of the Earth's population on only about 8% of the Earth's surface in the area of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Following the migration westward, Asia Minor, Africa, and Europe have 32% of the world's population, and then the Americas with 14%. 

This entire 54% of the human is watered from the same frozen reservoir atop of the Himalayas, via the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. The unity of origin of this vast population, and the unity of its source of water and life, is crucial for understanding geopolitical and religious dynamics, and the importance of Tibet at the headwaters. 

Thailand became the center of the beginnings of more advanced ship technology and design engineering, eventually incorporating bronze fastenings and developing the prototypes of the powerfully ribbed, deep-bellied ships the Phoenicians sailed across the Indian Ocean and to Mesopotamia, scene of the biblical Garden of Eden story. Crucially, this ship technology, and the dhow in particular, enabled humanity to travel westward, against the prevailing winds and currents. 

All civilization had its origins in the network of maritime interlinkages of early cultures. 

## Humanity Aboard Earth 

It is evidenced that throughout all earlier times until yesterday, the ruling social powers assumed the human masses to be largely ignorant and useful primarily for their muscle. 

We may soon discover that all babies are born geniuses and only become degeniused by the erosive effects of unthinkingly maintained false assumptions of the grown-ups, with their conventional ways of “bringing up” and “educating” their young. 

We now know that schools  are the least favorable environment for learning. The  home TV, computer, or tablet is far more effective, but we are allowing the big money-making advertisers to poison the information children assimilate in their four to five hours a day of spontaneous turning-on, looking at and listening to screens. 

In the graphically recorded history of the last eight millennia, as well as in the dim twilight of pre-Indo-Chinese,  Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and South and Central American graphic documentations of history, there have appeared, from time to time, individuals who grew to maturity without losing the full inventory of their innate, intuitive, and spontaneously coordinate faculties. These unscathed  individuals inaugurated whole new eras of physical environmental transformation so important as, in due course, to affect the lives of all ensuing humanity. We shall hereafter identify such unscathed, comprehensively effective,  and largely unidentified individual articulators as the  artist-scientists of history.  

Since the dawn of the most meagerly revealed human  history there have been a number of importantly distinct  periods of historical transformation of both the physical and cosmological environments of society. Each of these eras has been opened by the artist-scientist. 

The environment—everything that is “not me”—is subdivisible into two parts, [[Physical]] and [[Metaphysical]]. The  metaphysical environment consists of human thoughts,  generalized principles and customs.

Physiology and biology make it clear that at the outset of graphically recorded history a universally illiterate—but  probably not unintelligent—humanity was endowed by a wisdom higher than its own with innate and spontaneously self-regenerative drives such as hunger, thirst, and species regeneration. 

These drives probably were designed into humans  to ensure that human life and the human mind—long unacknowledged as humanity’s highest faculty—ultimately would discover its own significance and would become established and most importantly ***operative*** not only aboard planet Earth, but also in respect to vast, locally evidenced aspects of Universe.

Mind possibly may serve as the essential, [[Anti-Entropic]] ([[Syntropic]]) function for eternally conserving the omni-interaccommodative, nonsimultaneous, and only partially overlapping, omniintertransforming, self-regenerating scenario—which we speak of as Universe. 

To fulfill its paramount function of conserving the scenario Universe, it will have to apprehend, comprehend, and telologically employ the metaphysical omni-intercooperative generalized principles of Universe in strategically effective degree and within a critical time limit. 

This can be accomplished in Progressively More Effective Ways - for instance by more competently fielding the physical energy increments entropically broadcast by the stars, and employing the appropriate biological and physiological principles to collect, sort, analyze, synergetically comprehend, and combine into complex but orderly macro-and-micro-cohering aggregates. They then must be added into the Earth biosphere's resource-conserving-and-storing inventory. 

The task of metaphysical intellect is to cooperate with Universe as a major syntropic factor by collecting, sorting, and combining information into ever more advantageous and orderly patterns, or designs, to offset the physical Universe's macrocosmic proclivities of becoming locally ever more dissynchronous, asymmetric, diffiuse, and multipyingly expansive. 

In other words, Spirit, and its derivative, Mind, are the main [[Anti-Entropic]] forces in the universe. 

The Earth is a locale in the Universe where energies from stars are being collected and photosynthetically combined in an orderly molecular assembly as hydrocarbons, which are consumed by orderly designed species, and then self-multiply to make these biological species grow, undergo transformations, and eventually return to the Earth. 

Bucky argues that Babylonian geometry as far back as 3,000 BC is spherical and omnidirectional; that Greek and Egyptian geometers like Euclid retrogressed by 300 B.C. into two dimensional plane geometry, possibly intentionally. 

Superimposed upon this plane, two dimensional base the Greek and Egyptian geometers subsequently developed a timeless, weightless, temperatureless, three-dimensional, cubical coordinate system whose squares and cubes were geometrically irreconcilable with  a spherical Earth and all the other radiationally and gravitationally divergent-convergent, inherently nucleated, finite,  spherical systems’ growths and shrinkages—electromagnetic and acoustical, spherically gradient wave propagations. 

squares and cubes were geometrically irreconcilable with  a spherical Earth and all the other radiationally and gravitationally divergent-convergent, inherently nucleated, finite,  spherical systems’ growths and shrinkages—electromagnetic and acoustical, spherically gradient wave propagations. 

All geometrical proofs of the Euclidean Greeks had to  originate in the two-dimensional plane geometry and not  in the three-dimensional configuration or four-dimensional  temperatured, weighted, and lengthed reality.  

## Writing 

The ability of humans to write in vertical or horizontal  lines of symbolic forms—i.e., Tartarian picto-linguistic, hieroglyphics, cuneiform, Linear A, Linear B, and so on—required great expertise and was not commonly useful. In  1500 B.C. the Phoenicians invented letters for each  known mouth-and-lungs-articulated sound. Having developed phonetic pronunciation of each letter, they therefrom evolved combined pronunciation of each word. Five  hundred years later, in 1000 B.C., the Greek language, employing the Phoenician phonetic spelling concept, developed the twenty-four pronounceable letters which are the  same as those used in the Greek writing of present-day—  late-twentieth-century-A.D.—Greece. This phonetic form  made practical the individual scientists’ own recording of  their own thoughts as well as the thoughts of others.  

## Microcosmic Thinking

As yet convergently-divergently omniconsiderate, in  the manner of the Babylonians, and thinking microcosmically, the Greek Democritus in 460 B.C. was the first  known human to conceive of a smallest cosmic entity. He  named it the “atom.”  

## Macrocosmic Thinking

Thinking macrocosmically, the Greek Pythagorean scientists of 600 to 400 B.C., situated to the north of Athens,  were the first people known and recorded to think of our  world as a spherical entity.

## Heliocentricity, or Galactic Thinking

In 410 B.C. the Pythagorean  Philolaeus was the first to describe the Earth as a spherical body in motion around a central cosmic fire. bodies. His Sun was not at the center of the  planetary system’s motion. There is a possibility that he  was thinking in galactic, rather than in solar-centered,  terms. 

In 350 B.C. the latter-day Pythagorean Heraclides was the  first to conceive of the Earth sphere as spinning west to  east. But Heraclides’ cosmos was as yet geocentric.

Another Greek, Aristarchus, conceived around 200  B.C. of the spherical Sun as the center of the spherical  planets’ orbital system as each planet revolved individually around its own axis at its own unique rate while also  orbiting the Sun in greater orbital time periods. For him all  the stars were fixed, and the Moon revolved around the  Earth. His unprecedented thoughts almost got him killed.  

Eratosthenes, in 200 B.C., measuringly calculated the  circumference of Earth within 1.5-percent accuracy.

Around the same year, 200 B.C., the Stoic philosopher  Crates developed the first terrestrial globe—celestial  globes preceded it. 

It is clear that a special chain of Greek scientistphilosopher-cosmologists consisting of Philolaeus (410  B.C.), Heraclides (350 B.C.), and Aristarchus (200 B.C.)  had successively evolved a concept of the solar system  that was in fair agreement with that of Copernicus and  Kepler 1700 years later (1543 A.D.) and even with our  late-twentieth-century conceptioning.  

## Intentional Concealment 

It seems almost equally clear that between 200 B.C.  and 200 A.D. a deliberately planned policy was adopted by the combined supreme political and religious power  structure of that period, which undertook the conditioning  of the human reflexes to misconceive and mis-see (or  mostly not see at all) the macro-micro-cosmic systems in  which we live. Their success drew the curtains on science  for 1700 years—until 1500 A.D. That curtain would never  again have been raised had it not been for the discovery  of that something-called-nothing—the cipher. Because it  was “nothing,” the information-monopolizing, physicalproperty coveting power structure had overlooked it. 

## The Zero

The zero - known to the Arabs as [[Sifr]], to the Romans as [[Cifra]], and to the English as [[Cipher]]. The cipher alone  made possible humanity’s escape from the 1700-year monopoly of all its calculating functions by the power structure operating invisibly behind the church’s ordained few. 

All chances that you might discover this were seemingly banished when the emperors  of the Roman Empire usurped and amalgamated the vast  religious priesthood power with their already-established  military supremacy.  

It was the Asiatic, 800 A.D. publishing of the function  of the cipher by al-Khwarizmi the Arab that ultimately  saved the day when, in about 1200 A.D., knowledge of it  reached northern Italy and southern Germany by way of  Carthage in North Africa.  

## Alexandria and Maps, Flat World and Spherical World 

The total overall evolutionary events of 400 to 200  B.C. in the eastern Mediterranean world saw all the extraordinary Greek intellectual activity transpiring almost exclusively in the city of Alexandria—founded by Alexander  the Great in 332 B.C. on the delta at the westernmost  mouth of Egypt’s River Nile. In 100 B.C. the Alexandrian library was said to have contained 700,000 volumes, or  manuscript scrolls. Fortunately some of those volumes in  Alexandria were meticulously copied and distributed to libraries around the civilized world of that time, for over 40,000 volumes of the Alexandrian library were burned in  47 B.C. during a siege in the war between Caesar and  Pompey. In 272 A.D. a Roman emperor burned the Alexandrian  library for a second time. The third burning of the Alexandrian library was accomplished by a later Roman emperor  in 391 A.D. In 529 A.D. all the Mediterranean universities  were closed. In 642 A.D. occurred the final complete burning of the library of Alexandria by Muslims.  

As we have already described, the earliest known  world maps are Eratosthenes’ surprisingly informative 200  B.C. map and the 200 A.D., latitude-and-longitudedivided, fanlike, cylindrical stretch-out of Ptolemy, which  dropped out the south African territory of Eratosthenes  but included China, Arabia, and India.  

It is quite evident to us that  Eratosthenes had great confidence that his world had  been circumnavigated. He knew that we live on a spherical planet. Why else would he have been inspired to make  his remarkably accurate measurement of the Earth’s circumference, etc.?  The 200 B.C. coincidence of Eratosthenes’ world map,  Crates’ world globe, and the Phoenicians’ sky-star-globeadvantaged circumnavigation is highly visible only when using my (Fuller's) Dymaxion world map.

With the exception of the B.C. Greek, spherically informed world mapping, all the post-Roman emperorpope’s and pre-1500 A.D. comprehensive maps show the world as a flat-out system surrounded by an infinitely extendable, planar wilderness.  

The real consequences of that—psychologically, philosophically, and mathematically—are devastating. It means  that “inside” the empire we have something we call civilization, while “outside” the empire begins the unknown wilderness peopled with brutes and worse, and outside of  that, live dragons, and beyond the dragons, flat infinity.  

All humanity (since) has thought of its own local area as being familiar, organized, and a priori, with all else remote and unthinkable.  

## Systems 

Systems always divide all Universe outside the system from  all of the Universe inside the system. All systems are finite  subdividers of macro- and micro-Universe.

## Power Structures 

In our comprehensive reviewing of published, academically accepted history we continually explore for the invisible power structure behind the visible kings, prime ministers, czars, emperors, presidents, and other official head  men, as well as for the underlying, hidden causes of individual wars and their long, drawn-out campaigns not disclosed by the widely published and popularly accepted  causes of those wars.  

## Prophets

There may be great significance in the fact that Pythagoras in Greece and Buddha in the Orient occur at the  same time—in the sixth century B.C. Both are powerfully,  perceptively thinking and acting human individuals who,  coming out of a past in which only the mystically ordained  kings counted and humans were omniexpendable pawns,  produced mathematical tools and philosophic breakthroughs for individual humans forever thereafter to employ. Their scientific and philosophic gifts to humanity  were in marked contrast to the self-advantaging military  conquests of kings. Pythagoras, in a little town north of  Athens in the Near East, and Buddha, in the Far East, utterly unknown to one another, co-occur as a vast amount  of moral and spiritual thinking is taking place in the Near  East as recorded in the Old Testament of the “prophets.”  Historical research indicates a succession of “Isaiahs”  starting at about the same time as Pythagoras and Buddha and as the Greek school of scientists and scientific  thinkers, running to 200 B.C. Isaiah the Second speaks of  “turning the swords into plowshares and spears into pruning knives” and “leopard lying down with the lamb” and  prophesies “a little child shall lead them.” 

Nonrural, nonmilitary humans had (for the first time) words and mathematical tools and writing ability with which to initiate a breakthrough toward ultimate emancipation of all humans.

Humans had found that each one had a  private “hotline” to God. What the power structures  needed was a way to put in a control switchboard so that  the individuals would have to “call up” God only through  officialdom’s censor-supervised switchboard.  

Herein lies the source of the  Church’s persistent maintenance of its dogma and authority in the face of a technologically emergent and potentially powerful humanity. 

## Astronomy

The world-around priest-navigator’s cosmological authority was responsible for the astronomical observatory structures as yet standing in India, Mesopotamia, Crete, Egypt,  England, and Central America.  

## Ignorance

As recorded in the stone carvings of Egypt and Mesopotamia, the history of world society begins with humanity at large knowing nothing of physics, chemistry, or biology. Humans recognized but few safe edibles. Humans  had witnessed many lethal poisonings by superficially attractive items plucked from the mysterious scenery. Infection was rampant. Average survival was in the neighborhood of twenty-two years...

## Holy Roman Empire and 1500 Years of Dark Ages

However once everybody had the potential for entry into Heaven... the power became swifty annexed by the Holy Roman Empire / emperor-pope, giving rise to the vast European church-state-empire and 1500 years of Dark Ages. 

During the Dark Ages those individuals endowed with  creative powers and insights seem by and large to have  carefully avoided attempting to reform the political, religious, or scientific status quo.

## Emerging Out of Darkness 

With ever-accelerating technological development in  preparing for everyone’s next life as well as the king’s and  nobles’ this-life enjoyment, the time arrived when it became evident and was spontaneously realized that in addition to attending to getting everyone but the unfortunate  “to-Hell-bound sinners” into Heaven and providing the enjoyment of this life by both the king and the nobles, it was  possible to take care of the enjoyment of this life by the  rich middle-class society. This gave rise to the Victorian  Age. Sometimes spoken of as the Industrial Revolution,  this technological advantaging of the rich middle class  was enormously advantaged by the circa-1500 A.D. introduction of the cipher-permitted-engineering-and-scientific  calculation. 

All the foregoing human-mind-invented scaffolding,  technological advantaging, and the all-history recording  of the total accumulated inventory of artifacts and scientific discoveries, led to the opening of the twentieth century, when a handful of perceptive individuals... saw that the total environment-advantaging  technology had become so effectively developed that it  made possible the advantaging not only of the afterlives  but also of the lives of all humanity.

Then came man’s discovery of electromagnetics,  atomic physics, metallurgy, and chemistry, and the whole  new world of invisible, nonsensorially contactable—ergo,  only instrumentally or only mathematically apprehensible—reality.

Thereby, all of previous time’s mysteries were  either logically explained or dismissed. Technology expanded reality 999-fold to include the whole range of the  invisible events of Universe. These had been held previously by humans to be magical and superstitiously mystical. Now they had become the realities...

## The Spherical Closed-System Earth 

In all the cosmological models of early civilizations, all the perpendiculars were extended in only two directions in relation to man’s erroneously conceived flat Earth. Only a flat-out world  could have a Heaven to which to ascend and a Hell into  which to descend. Though I have been trying for fifty-three years to  rid myself of the words up and down, I find them popping  out in my speech.  

We now know that we do not live on a flat-slab Earth.  We do live on board an 8000-mile-in-diameter spherical  spaceship speeding around the Sun at 60,000 miles per  hour, spinning axially as it orbits.

The first aviators flying completely around the Earth within its atmospheric mantle and gravitationally cohered to the planet,  having completed half their circuit, did not feel “up-sidedown.” They had to employ other words to correctly explain their experiences. So, aviators evolved the terms  “coming-in” for a landing and “going-out,” not "down" and “up.” Those are the scientifically accreditable  words—in and out. We can go only in, out, and around.  

On 1900, the “world,” as we know of it in 1980 after two official world wars and a third much more prolonged and ruthlessly vicious, unofficial world war, was utterly inconceivable. About 99  percent of humanity was illiterate.

Everyone “knew” that humans would  never reach the Moon. Any who wasted their time thinking about doing so were dismissed as luna-tics.  

...The world  came to identify history’s most successful world-outlaw  organization as “the British Empire.”  This was the first empire of man to occur after we  knew that the Earth was a sphere. A sphere is a mathematically finite, omnisymmetrical, closed system. A  sphere is finite unity.

Once the world is conceived of as a sphere—a  finitely closed system—there was no longer an infinite  number of possibilities, such as accompanied the misconception of the infinitely extended flat-out world.

It seems strange that we were not taught about the historical, philosophical, and economic significance of the  foregoing transition from an open-flat to a closed-sphere  world system. Because the churches were strong and the  great pirates wished to obscure both their monopoly of  the riches of the now limited system and their grand  world ocean strategy for its control, the significance of  the concept of a closed world system was popularly unrealized.

## Assumptions on Human Power Structures

Bucky assumes that throughout much of history, the most skillful, clever, big, and good man was made, or became, king. 

And that once in a while, another big man would come along to challenge him. And that to keep other big men from ganging up on him and defeating him, he would employ the divide to keep conquered strategy. 

And that then the king would progressively streamline people with unique skills into specialities. 

And that humans are not made by nature to be specialists, but rather centers for storing and retrieving information coming in from each and all our senses, and discovering the constantly varying interrelationships between special case experiences that can be expressed mathematically, and applying the mathematically expressed general principles to produce continuously improving artifacts that advance evolutionary potential. 

These advancements included the invention of weaponry by which mind and skill could defeat the brawn of the giants. 

Sling and spear led to bow and arrow led to catapults led to gunpowder and explosively hurled, instead of muscle or mechanical hurled, missiles. 

The human [[Power Structures]] that could best organize and marshal the complex of interessential best weapons and support an army of best-trained people were the ones who won the battles. 

## Land

Going back to the stone-sling, bow-and-arrow, spear,  club, and knife era of weapons, we find that territorial battles between American Indian nations, and tribes around the world, were fought over  the local hunting and fishing rights, but the land itself always belonged to the Great Spirit. To the indigenous it was  obvious that humans could not own the land.

The land belonged to the Great Spirit. The  people lived on the flesh of their animals and the encountered fruits, berries, nuts, and herbs. They kept themselves warm with clothing made of the skins of the animals and also with environment-controlling tents made of  local saplings and the animal skins.  

## Horses 

We have a king shepherd, from the day of the giants,  tending his people and his flock, when along comes a little man on a horse, with a club hanging by his side.

Towering above the king shepherd, he coerces him by force to pay tribute, inaugurating the themes of racketeering "protection" and territorial "ownership" as a consequence of disproportionate power. 

## Gangs on Horses 

There there came great battles between horse-mounted-ownership-claiming gangs, who fought one another and easily captured human prisoners to build stone citadels with moats and drawbridges at strategic points. 

## Gangs of Gangs 

As "Deeds" to land evolved from deeds of arms, small battles evolved into larger battles of Gangs of Gangs, leading to mergers and acquisitions among [[Power Structures]], leading to the ascendence of the great emperors. 

## Land Ownership

This is how humans came to own land. The sovereign  paid off his promises to powerful supporters by signing  deeds to land earned by the physical deeds of fighting in  shrewd support of the right leader.

## Supply Lines

In another set of events that opportuned the power  structure the land barons discovered the most geographically logical trading points for caravaning: a place where  one caravan trail would cross another caravan trail;  where, for instance, the caravaners came to an oasis or  maybe to a seaport harbor and transfer some of their  goods from the camel caravans to the boats.

The horse-mounted gangers would bring prisoners to build city walls, terrorize the traders, extort protection payments, and ensure all trade happened within the slave-constructed walls, enabling taxation to occur and the city-state to arise. 

These generally occurred in two kinds: the agrarian-productivity-exploiting type and the trade-route-confluence-exploiting type. 

These produced the great walled cities such as Jericho and Babylon. 

These city-states were largely invincible until the advent of larger ships carrying enormous cargoes, which allowed the Phoenicians, Cretans, and Mycenaeans, for example, to successfully besiege Troy. 

The voyaging back to the supply sources and return to the line of battle was called their "line of supply." The new line-of-supply masters, the Greeks, starved out the Trojans. 

## The Shifting Power Structure 

At this time, the [[Power Structure of World Affairs]] shifted from control by the city-state to the masters of the [[Supply Lines]]. The power of the Roman Empire was built upon the development of ships and overseas lines of supply that supported the legions, and kept them supplied.
