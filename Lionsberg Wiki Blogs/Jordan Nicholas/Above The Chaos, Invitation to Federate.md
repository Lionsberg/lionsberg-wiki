# Above The Chaos, Invitation to Federate

## A Context of Uncertainty and Division 

Hello, 

Across the Force For Good, We are facing a crucial moment as the world shakes, and numerous teams and initiatives seek the resources and relationships required to cross the chasm that stands between Where We Are and the fulfillment of our ultimate Vision, Purpose, and Destiny - individually, locally and collectively. 

In The Game we are invited to Play, there is a strange and counterintuitive feature to this particular challenge: 

*None of us can achieve Liberty and Abundance unless and until All of us achieve Liberty and Abundance.*

*We can only enter into [[The Promised Land]] together.*

Every month We encounter new leaders and groups who *know* that We need to collaborate... who *know* that We are working on *the same thing*... and who are willing to do so just as soon as "they" secure "their" next tranche of resources. How many leaders do We know with incredible projects and potential, that just need that next $100,000 to $10 Million? How many leaders do We know who are wasting 50 to 90 percent of their time focused on searching out the resources required to stay afloat, rather than accelerating the critical work on the front lines? 

How many competing efforts at pulling together that first $10 Million for an initiative, or $100 Million for a fund, or a fund of funds? How many efforts to platform the platforms, and fund the funds? 

As much as we hate to admit it, the reality is that right now the leaders, teams, and initiatives that We would most like to see succeed are fragmenting attention and energy across the network, and functionally competing for the resources and relationships available to Us collectively if we would simply Unite. 

As the world shakes and systems verge towards collapse, there is simply not time for each of hundreds of leaders and teams to compete to secure their own narrow future. 

If hundreds of millions and then billions of dollars do not rapidly flow to connect and empower the Force For Good, we are not even in the ballpark of responsible effort to meet this moment in history. *This can only happen together.*

## A Call To Unity  

There is only One Earth. There is only One Living System. There is only One Moment in The Story. There is only One set of Divine Blueprints. There is only One Highest Overarching and Uniting Aim, Intention and Goal. There is only one Force For Good. In all our vast Diversity. 

Yes of course we need to co-create 12 to 24 major georegional tech manufacturing and space faring hubs. 

Yes of course we need to co-create 150 to 200 bioregional hubs. 

Yes of course we need to co-create 750 to 1,000 ecoregional hubs. 

Yes of course we need to co-create 100,000 local hubs. 

Yes of course we need to co-create 1,000,000 micro hubs. 

Yes of course those need to include everything necessary for convening, meeting, governing our selves, visioning, valuing, planning, resourcing, manufacturing, farming, creating, learning, designing, building, healing and co-creating. 

Yes of course we need to build millions of federated co-operative enterprises that collectively empower small teams to collaborate to solve the grand challenges and accomplish the global goals. 

Yes of course we need to build thousands of regenerative communities. 

Yes of course we need to build the platforms, marketplaces, supply lines, and matchmaking capabilities. 

Yes of course we need to create the protocols. 

Yes of course we need to honor the Minimum Standards of Interoperability. 

Yes of course we need to honor the vast cultural, tribal, and bioregional diversity. 

After years of Progressive Articulation, the New Pattern Language is becoming increasingly self-evident. As the Divine Blueprints become increasingly clear, it is time to accelerate the shift from vision to implementation. It is time to rapidly bring Intention Into Reality. 

And we can only do that together. 

## An Invitation to Federate 

Over the last 7 years, We have done Our best to curate together the first tens of millions of dollars of Value into a Commons we call Lionsberg, and we have set a target to connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]] of the population, 250 Million Strong, by 2026. 

Our vision is to set trillions of dollars of Value in flow by empowering leaders and Teams to tackle meaningful Quests that stack up and align to produce throughput of our shared Purpose, Goals, and Values. 

Please, let Us Unite Our efforts. 

## The Rules of The Game 

To make this work, We All will need to learn how to Play together. 

Because it is a spiritual Game, the rules are Ultimately Unwritten... 

At a high level they are something like: 

1. We are United by our shared Pursuit of the Highest Intention and Greatest Good 
2. We Co-Create in service of and partnership with One and All  
3. We Co-Create in a Spirit of Love  
4. We Steward The Commons for the Good of All Current and Future Generations of Life   
5. We All have an equal citizenship / stake / share in Lionsberg  
6. We aggregate and coordinate [[The First Tenth]] of our available Flow of Time, Energy, Attention, and Resources to Continuously Improve The Commons  
7. We [[Federate  Everything]]   
8. We Co-Create via [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams / Groups / Communities / Localities    
9. We Stack Up and Align our efforts as a Team of Teams / Group of Groups to produce Throughput of [[The Goal]]   
10. We Rightly Relate to One Another on the basis of reciprocity and ongoing mutual consent   

We invite... desire... long... to federate and Become, out of many, One.
