What if...

...the world you thought you were living in was a lie? 
____
What if... 

...the stories, myths, and legends were True?
___

It is *almost never* True that Our civilization is Collapsing. 

Everything will *almost always* be Ok. 

However sometimes...  

...things are not ok. 

Very occasionally, the building We are asleep in is on fire. 

Very occasionally, Evil is at the gates. 

Very occasionally, the Existing Order is collapsing. 
____
There is no such thing as a Beginning or End in the Eternal Universe. 

And yet here We are. 

At the End of a world. 

And the Beginning of another. 

____
 There is a strange feature to the Collapse that is underway...

...which is that the Control Structure was designed such that it cannot be spoken about. 

The control structure hides itself in the Darkness. 

The control structure buries the Speakers of Truth. 
_____
"We are asleep in a burning building."

"I don't agree". 

**And thus, they perished in the flames.**
