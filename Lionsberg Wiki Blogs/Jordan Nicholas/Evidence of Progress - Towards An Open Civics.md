# Evidence of Progress - Towards an Open Civics

A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
December 1, 2024

In 2017, it was difficult for Us to find One Another, and very few of Us had words yet for what We were being instructed to do. 

By 2020, some of Us had found One Another, but We lacked a language to speak about the [[Meta Crisis]] and the [[Divine Blueprints]] for the [[New World]] We were perceiving. 

By 2022, We were learning the [[New Language]], but struggling with fears, differences, and self-interest that prevented Us from really becoming [[ONE Bodyx]]. 

By 2024, the [[Pattern Language]] for the [[New World]] was largely self-evident, and the [[New Language]] was beginning to be known and spoken widely. 

As evidence of this progress, multiple publications started popping up, reinforcing with ever more clarity the [[New Language]] and [[New Pattern Language]] We were All perceiving aspects of. 

**We were honored to be among the first to receive [Towards An Open Civics](https://simplebooklet.com/towardsanopencivics#page=1) in late November 2024 as one such excellent example and confirmation.** 

Now that the [[Pattern Language]] is clear enough to those of Us being moved by One Spirit, We have to cross the rubicon the Force For Good has been stuck at for the last couple years, which is how to embody becoming parts of [[ONE Bodyx]] based on the patterns and protocols, while recognizing that ***no one*** is or can be the [[ONE]]. 

And yet We still have to actually Become and Do "the thing". We still have to become [[ONE Bodyx]] so that We can continually co-create the [[New World]].  

***It is the classic and well documented issue of Transcendence, Immanence, and Incarnation*** that has baffled humanity for the last two millennia.  

Incarnation is difficult, because as soon as We descend into Form and try to Embody the Spirit and Logos of the [[ONE]], We are no longer [[ONE]]. Our [[Apparently Individuated]] form arrives as a helpless infant, crying, hurting, struggling against Reality and Entropy, and trying to remember how to crawl. 

Our flag is still planted in the understanding that the [[Divine Blueprints]] are transcendent of any of Our words, and self-evidently clear to those who can See. They belong to [[ONE]] and [[All]]. The Open Civics document points that out eloquently. 

As builders, We *know* that if ***10 million communities*** of ~5 thousand to ~10 thousand each need to identify and train [[The First Three Percent]] and then localize and adapt the [[Divine Blueprints]] to their context in 7 to 10 years... 

...it is going to take an incarnate System, Infrastructure, Process and Plan *at least as competent and powerful* as what would be required to build a roadway, co-operate a company, co-create a colony on Mars, or transition into an interstellar civilization after prying free Our technology from the hands of the [[Fascist Security State]] that is weaponizing it against Us. 

Now the [[Pattern Language]] is clear, and We know that the milestones of implementation run through [[The First Few]] and then [[The First Three Percent]] in any given [[SpatioTemporal Domain]]... 

...it is Time to begin measurable implementation and rollout. This is where Our lifetimes of work and expertise again converge.   

We are here for this... to incarnate and become [[ONE Bodyx]], and to begin learning to crawl together, as painful and humiliating as it can be. 

[[Benjamin Life]] and [[Patricia Parkinson]] - thank you for your excellent work, and thank you for helping Us All advance towards [[The Goal]]. 

We are here to serve.
