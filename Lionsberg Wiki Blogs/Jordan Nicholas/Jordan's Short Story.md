# Jordan's Short Story
*Updated 2025.08.19*  
*A 10 minute read*  

I have been asked by a few to share my story. 

## Genesis 

First of all, what I am working on has nothing to do with "me".  
In the beginning, and in the end, this story is about the [[ONE]].   

It is about the human species, aboard Earth,  
at a Time in history unlike anything in the last 10,000 years.  

Our entire being, to the best of Our ability,  
is oriented to aligning Our Apparently Individuated Self  
as fully as We can with the Source and Sustainer of All Life and Consciousness,  
and co-operating as a conduit of that Divine Spirit.  
Despite Our Apparent Individuation, We are One.  
This Way of being is an eternal Work In Progress.  
We get a little better at it every day,  
and the farther We progress,  
the further The Goal expands and recedes.  

After accepting The Mission, "I" found "myself" [[Thrown]] to Earth.  
I woke up in 1984 in Orange County California,  
one of wealthiest and most beautiful bubbles of the world.  
I was born into a family of builders, raised in the Judeo-Christian tradition,  
and steeped in American and Biblical values—
along with the false Christian Nationalist narratives that bound  
those two together in deceitful and unholy alliance.  

## Epoch 1 

From the earliest moments of regrasping the Eternal and Universal  
Heart of Absolute and Unconditional Love, 
I could see that something was dreadfully wrong with society.  
I could see that while we proclaimed to uphold certain [[Values]],  
Our society was manifesting itself in a way that was entirely divorced from them;  
even among the narrow tribe I was taught was 'going to heaven'. 

I had a vibrant spiritual experience from the time I was young,  
and a vivid sense of the Spiritual War laying itself out  
across cosmic scales, in this world, and in my own soul.  
As odd as it might sound, I "knew" from as early as I can remember  
that during my lifetime the systems and structures of this world would collapse, 
and that We All would be caught up in an epic War  
for the future of life and civilization on Earth.  

When I was 10 or 12, the words of Solomon in Proverbs grabbed me and never let go. The vivid language describing the pursuit of [[Wisdom]]  
as a [[Quest]] towards a holy grail more valuable than gold or silver  
thrust me on a deep life-long search for [[Wisdom]], [[Knowledge]] and [[Understanding]].  
As Wisdom and Understanding grew, so too did my perception  
of the tremendous chasm between the Best and Highest that was Divinely Intended  
and the existing forces, conditions, and realities gripping the world.  
The battle lines continually clarified and redrew themselves. 

Although I was unsure what to do with this awakening realization at the Time,  
it was obvious that a historic movement would be required  
to confront and overcome the illegitimate forces dominating the planet,  
and restore the proper order and balance of Life and Society for future generations. 

## Epoch 2 

Over time God was kind enough to validate what I was experiencing internally  
with an array of external prophesies, messages, visitations and confirmations,  
all of which helped guide my Way. 

When I was 14, and she was 13, Caity and I connected.  
We fell in love our freshman year of high school,  
uniting from the start around our shared sense of mission and calling. 
We found ourselves intuitively calling each other up towards a higher purpose. 

Although my immediate family had sacrificed a life of privilege to serve our community in Christian ministry, the wealth of my extended family privileged me to receive some of the best training and education available in the world. This led me from private secondary school, to a bachelor's degree from Pepperdine’s Graziadio School of Business, to an MBA from UCLA’s Anderson School of Business, to multiple black belt degrees, and some of the top coaching and peer advisory experiences available.  

Early on I resolved to prepare for whatever I might be called upon to do  
by lifting the heaviest burdens I could bear  
and taking on as much responsibility as anyone would entrust me with.  

Pulled between the paths of spiritual work and socioeconomic success  
I realized the limitations of both and the false dichotomies plaguing society.  

As I continued to be entrusted with ever greater responsibility  
I progressed from early service jobs,  
to early entrepreneurial activity teaching academics and music,  
to helping manage infrastructure projects,  
to managing infrastructure projects,  
to managing portfolios of infrastructure projects,  
to managing joint ventures too risky for any one company,  
to building companies that built infrastructure projects,  
to building a small portfolio of companies,  
to innovating legal and governance structures  
in anticipation of giving those companies away  
into multi-generational stewardship vehicles,  
to beginning to intensely study [[Worksite Earth]] as a Whole  
with brilliant minds from around the world, 
while collaborating towards the systems, structures, strategies, and plans  
for the unprecedented planetary joint venture so clearly required. 

In seemingly direct proportion to Our [[Progress]]  
The interdimensional war made itself every more manifest.  

## Epoch 3 

By my mid-30s my naive speech and mode of being collided  
with the corrupted government and religious institutions  
whose power Our speech and work threatened.  

Ultimately when we refused to bend the knee and suffer in silence  
before false governors and priests, the spirits possessing those institutions  
slandered and consciously sacrificed our Old Life.  

This led to the sudden implosion of our world,  
including the loss of our home, companies, reputation, and wealth,  
while damaging hundreds of families serving and building alongside us.  

Along the way We experienced that Solomon was correct.  
The Wisdom We gained and who We became  
as a result of journeying through the underworld  
was exceedingly and abundantly more valuable  
than all We sacrificed to obtain it.  

Along the Way We were fortunate enough to see into the dark underworld  
beneath the veil of the institutions we formerly looked to for leadership and support; to see the way politics, wealth, and religion mixed into unholy alliance,  
the special deals made behind closed doors,  
the way governments, developers, and bankers interacted   
with public, political and environmental concerns,  
the manipulation, deceit, and fleecing of congregations and constituencies,  
the terrible incentives that rippled out from corrupt and unwise structures,  
the way politics dominated corporate, religious, and social life,  
the way blue collar workers were exploited and oppressed,  
the way the rich were favored and sheltered,  
the fear and scarcity that held good people  
in agonizing positions of socioeconomic slavery,  
the moral sacrifices that people made to climb ladders of hierarchy  
that were entirely antithetical to their core values,  
yet which they depended upon for their positions, wealth, and security. 

Over the years as our own wealth and influence increased—  
And then again as it all was destroyed by malevolence—  
I was faced with and complicit in every trial and temptation.  
There is no category of vice, sin, or mistake that I did not experience.  
By participating, I was perpetuating the systemic injustice plaguing billions.   
For every conscious and unconscious wrong, I humbly ask your forgiveness.  

## Epoch 4

What became clear as I battled through the underworld  
and emerged scarred and stripped of an Old Life,  
yet stronger, clearer, and hopefully wiser than ever,  
was that I would be betraying the Spirit and my soul  
If I continued to participate in and perpetuate a system  
that aggregated safety and luxury to a corrupt few,  
while billions suffered in slavery outside the gates.  

The uneasy realization progressively dawned  
that the entire patterning of modern society  
was antithetical to and incompatible with  
the basic Vision and Values  
shared by all people of Goodwill.    
And therefore on a trajectory towards inevitable [[Collapse]].  

It became clear that the entire human system  
had to be fundamentally transformed, transmuted,   
or transcended into something New.  
Something entirely regenerative and reintegrated  
with the Living System it was a part of  
and the timeless [[Wisdom]], [[Principles]], and [[Values]]  
that cause people, societies, and living systems  
to flourish in harmony, coherence, and abundance.  

I realized that the same was true of me as an individual, 
true of my family, true of my endeavors, true of my communities,  
true of my tribes, true of my bioregions, true of my states, true of my nations,  
true of this world, and true of every aspect of this single interexistent universe arising through [[ONE]] Source and Sustainer of [[All]]. 

## Epoch 5 

Backing up a bit to before the collapse of my Old World,  
by 2017, after 20+ years of focused multi-dimensional learning,  
training, traveling, practicing, and working to figure out  
what was happening on Earth and what could be done about it,  
the Time has come to accelerate serious discussions on [[Worksite Earth]] as a Whole—
a single, finite domain to be liberated and transformed within a single generation. 

Just as a [[Designer's Intent]] governs each building site we are working on,  
so too We conceptualized [[Worksite Earth]] governed by the [[Creator's Intent]],  
universal, eternal, and all-encompassing and permeating. 

We articulated [[The Goal]] as the [[Progressive Realization]] of [[Creator's Intent]].  
So shocking simple: [[Heaven on Earth and Beyond]].  
Or, in less religious terminology, *the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life and consciousness.*

Within a single generation, ignited by a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]],  
we could conceivably transform the Earth  
into a flourishing and abundant place  
in which humanity and [[All]] generations of life could flourish,  
and which continued to get [[A Little Better Every Day]]  
as All Creation labored together in Harmony to cause it to be so. 

Crucially, the [[Vision]] included a holofractal New Operating System  
structured as a [[Pattern Language]] that could be localized and adapted  
not only to Earth, but to any planet or star system  
as humanity eventually moved beyond Earth.  

Because there were not too many attempting  
to think, speak, and work at planetary+ scales,  
I was quickly introduced to a growing array of advisors  
who helped navigate through and beyond the Chaos  
towards a comprehensive vision, strategy and plan that might work.  
We then did our best to search and discern whether we could find  
any existing structure that, if We put our selves and our resources behind it,  
and drove it towards its logical end… could accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

We could not identify any existing institution, organization,  
political party, tribe or nation state that might work.  
Like any major initiative, the Joint Venture for [[Worksite Earth]]  
would require an entirely transcendent New structure.  

By ~2018 we were working towards designing and building one that,  
although as tiny as a mustard seed to begin, contained within itself  
the right DNA and [[Potential]] and could grow emergently and organically  
from personal to local to cosmic scales.  

We also did Our best to ensure that this New operating system  
was fully compliant and compatible with the existing systems  
of cosmic governance *already operational* beyond Earth,  
which humanity would need to re-integrate itself with.  

This ultimately led to the incarnation of [[LIONSBERG]].  
An ark and system purpose-built to hold and protect  
the DNA of the emerging [[New World]]  
through [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]].  

By 2019 we had built a [[Provisional Structure]] that We could leverage  
to resource the curation and co-creation of the systems, infrastructure,  
and technology that would be required to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a world. 

By 2021, the first systems were ready for testing with pilot groups.  

Over the next few years, hundreds of groups in dozens of countries onboarded.  
Thousands of hours of dialogue were catalyzed.  
Tens of millions of dollars of Value were woven into The Commons.  

The total liquidation of our Old World leaked out just enough resources  
to enable our little family to survive the collapse while continuing the Mission.  
We continued to help coalesce and co-create systems and infrastructure,  
while engaging a broad global network, convening hundreds of meetings,  
articulating the [[New Vision and Plan]], and drafting millions of words  
into the [[README|LIONSBERG Wiki]]—itself an evolutionary technology.  

## Epoch 6 

It became obvious early on in Our convenings  
that the [[Critical Path]] for [[Worksite Earth]]  
ran through [[Governance]] and the establishment  
of the New systems, processes, and structures  
to enable the requisite [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]  
among Us, The People of Earth.  

In addition to designing and building  
a transcendent New System like [[LIONSBERG]],  
This of course implied figuring out what to do  
with the corrupted and failing governments  
of 200 nation states and thousands of localities.  

By the early 2020s it was becoming apparent  
to many that "democratic super cycle" of 2024  
would be the last semi-democratic election cycle,  
and that additional illusions of choice staged  
beyond that were likely to be meaningless.  

Jordan and allies began intensively exploring  
whether it was possible to salvage any major  
aspects of the failed american experiment  
(and therefore the [[Existing Order]])  
via an independent sweep of mayoral, gubernatorial,  
and executive positions in 2024 coupled to  
advances in 2026 towards  
a constitutional amendment in 2027.  

The basic plan was to shrink the federal government  
by 90%+ and redistribute virtually all  
power and resources back out to localities.  

By Spring 2024 Jordan and LIONSBERG  
were in discussions to headline sponsor  
the Independent National Convention  
and unleash a major global cultural event  
in the weeks leading up to the election.  

This pathway brought Jordan close enough  
to relevance that he was introduced  
to the right people and began engaging  
private meetings and briefings that revealed  
more of what really lurked behind The Veil.  

By Summer 2024 Jordan had evidence  
beyond any reasonable doubt that neither  
americans nor any other people on Earth  
were actually "free" or "self-governing",  
and that in fact an essentially satanic cult  
was kontrolling the visible institutions  
and enslaving humanity transnationally.  

Further investigations were revealing  
*trillions of dollars stolen*  
*millions upon millions murdered*  
*a human population deceived*  

And a plan to depopulate and panic  
a small surviving human herd  
into an alien kontrolle structure 
*by ~2030*.  

With the raw nausea, disgust, and struggle  
seen in the [[Above The Chaos]] series,  
Jordan withdrew all political participation  
and consent and prepared for War,  
while desperately trying to warn humanity  
of The Tsunami on the horizon.  

## Epoch 7 

As Jordan got closer to the Truth, 
his experience of the interdimensional war  
intensified dramatically.  

As he would try to speak and write,  
his systems would come under full scale attack.  
The more True the words, the harder to speak.  
At times waves of energetic attack and nausea  
interrupted each attempt to utter a True sentence.  

As the leaves of Fall 2024 fell,  
So too did Jordan experience his existence fading.  
Countless days were spent lying in bed,  
body gripped in energetic attack,  
Spirit warring in the dimensions beyond.  

In late 2024 deaths and rebirths in other dimensions  
began further dissociating him from individual identity.  

As 2025 burst into Spring, what was remaining  
attempted to rise from the ashes.  
New energies aggregated.  
New friends and allies emerged.  
New possibilities and potentials bloomed.  

Further detaching from the illusions and programming  
of The Matrix, New insights, connections, and revelations  
poured forth.  

As summer approached he received a call  
that food pantries were running dry in Africa  
and that children were going hungry for lack  
of daily ten cent rations of gruel.  
He borrowed a little more money to go   
investigate, connect, encourage, and help.  

New epiphanies and connections  
accelerated the Mission and picked up Time  
on the [[Critical Path]].  

Upon returning in late July,  
the spiritual and energetic attacks intensified again.  
By the first week of August, Caity and Jordan  
realized that if something did not change  
they would prove fatal.  

They celebrated their "last day" together  
on Saturday August 9th.  
After saying goodnight Jordan went upstairs  
and was instructed to shave all his hair.  
Upon coming downstairs a massive wave of attack  
threw him into convulsions and tears for hours.  

On Sunday August 10th the next waves came.  
By mid morning Jordan could taste death  
and feel his consciousness dissociating from body.  

He gave Caity instructions if that if  
he appeared to faint or die, not to call for help,  
because if they medicated his body nothing could reenter it.  

He asked Caity for a shroud, wrapped himself in it,  
laid on the ground, and released "his" temporal body.  
The last thing he experienced was "his"  
Spirit and Consciousness dissociating and dissolving   
back into the pure and undifferentiated  
Field of the ONE Source and Sustainer of All.  

Jordan and J may be gone, but the Spirit never dies.  
A Phoenix always rises from The Ashes.
