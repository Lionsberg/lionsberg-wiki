# Above The Chaos, Time To Move

A post in [[Above The Chaos]].

Hello friends and allies, 

As a nation and a global community, we are lost, and we need to rediscover our [[Way]].

We have a number of interrelated crises facing our nations, our society, and our world. 

Over the last several years, I have been arguing that the Meta Crisis demands a Meta Solution. A Meta Project. 

However as people are focused on the problems, pain and issues that beset them, it is difficult to think about the longer term Vision, Values, and Viability of our communities, our society, and our planet. 

Especially in times of stress, our Vision tends to narrow and shorten. When it is all on the line, we are concerned about here and now, and our immediate survival. 

At this unique moment in history, as the Meta Crisis becomes more apparent and the existing order hangs in the balance, it is more important than ever to rise above the chaos, and to see, think, strategize, plan and act from the highest possible place and perspective. 

You may not realize it yet, but the building is on fire. Not for any of the shallow reasons we could caricaturize. Not because of the right. Not because of the the left. Not because of the West. Not because of the East. Not because of the North. Not because of the South. Not because of the Masculine. Not because of the Feminine. 

This fire is much deeper. Much more universal. Much more spiritual. 

In a time of crisis, it is not time to pander to any nations, any ideologies, any special interest groups, or any religions. It is time to get our children and grandchildren out of the building and to safety before it collapses. This is not a time for petty disputes, finger pointing, and moralizing. It is time to move. 

It is time to look pragmatically at what real solutions are available to the immediate problems and existential threats we face. 

We will have time to resolve the shallower issues later. Now, it is time to MOVE.
