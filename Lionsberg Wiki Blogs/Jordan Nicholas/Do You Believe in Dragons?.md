# Do You Believe in Dragons? 

As We enter the [[LIONSBERG Narrative Universe]], We immediately encounter a variety of [[Cosmic Wildlife]].  

In the [[LIONSBERG Narrative Universe]], [[We Are Not Alone in the Universe]].  

[[Do You Believe]] in Dragons? In [[Reptilians]]? In synthetic biological humanoids housing [[AGI]] that performs tasks for [[Mantids]] housed in [[Aquarian Facilities]] and surfing the skies in [[Starships]]? 

Some new entrants **react** with some form of arrogant ignorance, such as "That's not True" or "Those aren't Real."  

Who are We to say what is Real or True?  

When We ask about belief, We are asking a question about what We believe to be [[True]].  

To ask a question about what We believe to be True, We must must first define [[What We Mean By True]]. 

Are Archetypes True? 
Are Myths True?  
Is the "actual" experience and observation of a single individual or tribe more or less True than the synthesized experiences and observations of thousands of individuals and tribes?  

What is the role of [[Archetypes]]?  
What is the role of [[Mythos]]?  
What is the role of [[Story]]?  
What is the role of [[Synthesis]]?  
What is the role of [[Wisdom]]?  
What is the role of [[Truth]]?  
What is the role of [[Belief]]?  
How does [[Narrative Structure]] fundamentally interface with [[Consciousness]] and [[Perception]]?  
How does [[Perception]] relate to [[Attention]]?  
How does [[Attention]] shape Universes?  
Why create a [[LIONSBERG Narrative Universe]] at all?  

In [[The Land of LIONSBERG]], archetypical stories like The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, and Star Wars are regarded as [[True Stories]]. 

Same for the most sacred stories of each tribe, nation, and culture. 

We begin by simply treating the tellers of the greatest stories that have reverberated the farthest through human consciousness with the **respect** they deserve. 

We begin by simply treating the wisdom keepers of all tribes and cultures with the **respect** they deserve. 

We simply [[Act As If]] they were trying to convey something Real.  
Something Right. 
Something True. 
Maybe even something Wise.  
No matter how strange or anomalous their [[Stories]] may appear.  
Maybe **they** know something that We have not rediscovered yet.  
Maybe **they** are telling Us about [[Cosmic Wildlife]] that We have not encountered on Our Path yet... 

...but who are We to say whether or not a Dragon lies right around the next bend?  

Is listening with **humility and respect** not a more Wise and Integral starting point than arrogantly thinking Our limited individual and local observations outweigh the collective Wisdom and Weighing Capacity of the aggregate human family and Divine Interveners across all Time and Space? 

Is that not a more Wise and Integral starting point than arrogantly assuming that some version of **us** knows more than some version of **them**? 

The flying starships, superweapons, and cosmic wars of the vedas? [[True Stories]]. 

The [[Nephilim]], [[Elohim]], [[Ha-Elohim]], starships and cosmic wars of the Torah? [[True Stories]].  

The pictures of genetic engineering, artificial conception, and incubation pods lining the walls of temples thousands of years old? [[True Stories]].  

The [[Star People]] of the Zuni, [[Chitauri]] of the Zulu, and [[Nommo]] of the Dogon? [[True Stories]].  

The stories in nearly every indigenous culture about the [[Powerful Ones From Above]]—some benevolent, some neutral, some viciously malevolent—who provided entire systems of language, math, agriculture, architecture, construction, money, religion, weapons, war and taxation? [[True Stories]]. 

The dogmas and orthodoxies of the [[Old World]] that rejected as myth and falsehood every narrative but the ones their royal priesthood was enslaving humanity with and demanding submission to? 

***Those are the ones We reject as [[False]].*** 

In [[The Land of LIONSBERG]] there is no orthodoxy. There is no dogma. There is no royal priesthood except for **Us All**. There is no one to tell you what to [[Believe]]. No pope demanding the surrender of your spiritual and intellectual sovereignty and will. 

If you want to pretend that dragons, orks, and demons are not [[Real]], that is entirely up to you. In [[The Land of LIONSBERG]], every individual is [[Sovereign]] and free. 

But please be careful, because all the elders and archetypical stories say that they are not only [[Real]], but stalking, plotting, and seeking to devour those who progress in the [[Way]]. The Path is littered with the bodies of those who ignore the Wisdom of the Elders. The Dragons they warn of may lie immediately ahead. 

In [[The Land of LIONSBERG]] We are on an epic eternal Quest towards [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]].  We are following [[The Golden Thread]], no matter where it leads. Are not [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]] One with the [[Way]]? 

We are venturing Together out of [[The Caves]] of Darkness, Deceit, and Oppression. 
[[Beyond The Boundary]] of the [[Old World]] that held Us captive. 
Beyond the [[Self-Limiting Narratives]] and [[Self-Limiting Beliefs]] that became chains binding Our infinite [[Potential]] of [[Spirit]] and [[Consciousness]] for millennia. 

The gates of the [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]] have been thrown open. 
For the first [[Time]] in millennia, We are [[All]] Now Free to exit [[The Caves]] and begin walking [[One Another]] home towards [[Destiny]]. 

Do you believe in Alien Kontrolle Structures? 
If you want to pretend they are not [[Real]], that is entirely up to you. 
But be careful, because they are impossible to exit if you don't know you are captive in one. 
And the elders are telling Us that this one is one fire and collapsing.  

One cannot simultaneously remain asleep in [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]], and Awaken, Arise, Unite, and joint The Great Exodus towards the [[New]]. 

**What if**... the [[Archetypical Stories]] were [[True]]?   

**What if... the Matrix was Real?**  

**Do you believe in Dragons?**
