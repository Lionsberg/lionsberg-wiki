# Notes on Essays on the Gita

We enjoy dancing, playing, and weaving with those Minds who have dared to dream of the Deeper things. 

And such it was, that Essays on the Gita, by Sri Aurobindo, was referred to Us as One among the Minds to Weave. 

Who knows where this Mind Weave will go, except to say that some of his words, and Ours, may have the Potential to Weave Together into something New and Good. 

Indeed the world abounds with scriptures sacred and profane, philosophies and anti-philosophies, sects, schools and systems, each purporting to Contain the Truth, while We All know that no one can contain the ONE. 

In times nearby We will try harder not to laugh at any of the 1,000 sects claiming that their particular set of words, in their particular language, in their particular Culture, Time, and Space, upon their particular planet, is actually the complete and inviolable Word of God, the Ultimate Reality behind trillions of galaxies, each containing trillions of star systems, each containing precisely God Knows What. 

If the millions of lives destroyed from such deceit had not already been lost, perhaps We could laugh, or try not to, Now. 

Indeed the bigoted exclusions and vain wranglings have ensnared even the otherwise elect, who are misled by some Darkness masquerading in the name of Light. 

Yet All of Goodwilll understand that Truth is Beyond Our Word Tools, Reality Beyond Our Maps, and God certainly Beyond Our Religions. 

In such a Light of course We begin the noble Quest of Navigating towards the Wisdom and Truth that shall eternally remain beyond Our grasp. 

It turns out that it is the Truth that [[We Do Not Know]] that sets Us Free; and not the arrogant illusion of knowing. 

There is a Truth, there is a ONE, there is an Ultimate Reality, and its sub-Realities, that We Seek. 

And We Know that Ultimate Reality, as such, cannot ever be shut up or contained within Our finite breadth of reasoning or knowledge. 

No canon can ever contain the ONE. 

"It is not likely to be found in its entirety or in all its bearings in any single philosophy or scripture or uttered altogether and forever by any one teacher, thinker, prophet, or avatar." 

Of course. 
Is that not obvious to All?  
Venturing across realms, dimensions, galaxies, and star systems, each with their numerous planets, each with their thousands of languages, is any immersed in such a structure of Kontrolle that they imagine their one book, in their one language, in their feeble little hands, to actually be the ONE? 

Will We continue to forbear with the intolerant exclusion of Truth underlying other systems, cultures, and philosophies? Are We still to immature to understand that ONE, Wisdom, and Truth belong equally, to All, in All realms and dimensions? 

Poor humans of Earth... mired for millennia in an Alien Kontrolle Structure... self-righteously brainwashed into clinging to false gods and countries in the Name of the ONE. What will it take to awaken the dead?
