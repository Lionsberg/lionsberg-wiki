# Above The Chaos, Introducing Lionsberg

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2022.11.01 _(updated 2022.11.01)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]].

This week marks a turning point. 

We have been thinking about this moment since waking consciousness. 

It is the moment where, in response to the impending collapse of an [[Old World]], the Spirit of Absolute and Unconditional Love and its Antithesis battle for the future of the world. 

We already know the outcome. [[Love]] wins. [[Love]] rises up and hovers over the chaos, confronts and overcomes the totalitarian, oppressive, and deceitful spirit that attempts to place itself above [[ONE]] and [[All]], and establishes a [[New Era]] and a [[New Order]] that is [[Good]]. 

At present, it appears bleak. The Four Horsemen are already on the run, and Hades is following them. Even greater [[Darkness]] and suffering will manifest before the [[New Dawn]]. 

But what comes next in the story is incredible. 

From around the world, out of seemingly nowhere, a universal [[Force For Good]] hears the call, awakens, arises, and unites to turn the tide of the battle and secure victory for [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

This ushers in an entirely [[New World]] that is not only perfect, but is continuing to [[Become]] [[A Little Better Every Day]] because we are all [[Working Together To Make It So]]. 

___
This is no longer a [[Story]] of any one tribe, people, or nation. 

It is a story of [[All]] tribes, [[All]] peoples, and [[All]] nations, rising up into [[Right Relationship]] with [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]].  

Each and every human being alive on earth at this moment in the [[Story]] is here for a reason. Out the billions of potentials that could have manifested, you did. We did. We [[All]] did. 

As [[Conscious Agents]] in a universal [[Meta Story]], each of us has a unique and critically important role to play. 
___
In preparation for this moment, we have been preparing. 

That preparation included co-creating an incarnation of the [[Meta Idea]] called [[LIONSBERG]].  

Lionsberg is a mythical [[Word Tool]] we use to point at three deeper realities: 

1. The [[New World]] we are co-creating and "pulling" into [[Reality]]. 
2. The Platform and System that connects, elevates, and empowers [[Conscious Agents]] in the [[Story]].  
3. The Community working together to co-create the [[Best Possible Future]] in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

___
Right now, each of these three elements is merely a [[Starting Point]]. 

However an entire forest of mighty trees is already present in the DNA. 

These trees will soon cover the earth, providing food, water, shelter, community and abundance for [[All]]. 
___
These seeds of a System that connects empowers a Community to co-create a [[New World]] are all present, and have been planted in a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] that is sufficient for the [[Life]] already present in their DNA to manifest itself. 
____
This week is significant because after an absolutely excruciating effort to give birth to the [[New]], the first green shoots in all three areas manifest themselves, and it is finally time to shift from the conception of the [[New World]] into working together to nurture and cultivate its development. 
___
There is only one possible outcome that constitutes [[Success]] for this very unusual [[New]] form of [[Life]], and that is to progressively [[Realize]] the [[Meta Goal]] within this generation. 

We will know the [[Meta Goal]] has been accomplished and can continue to be accomplished throughout the [[New Millennium]] when each of 8 billion individuals has been invited, 7 times if necessary, by someone they love and trust, to take up their citizenship in the [[New World]] [[LIONSBERG]] is co-creating and becoming, and 97% acceptance has been achieved. 
____
Why 97%? While we hope it is not true and [[All]] will voluntarily take up their citizenship in the [[New World]], because the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] is entirely based on [[Consent]] and Voluntary  [[Participation]], our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that there are some who are so corrupted by the [[Old World]] that they will decline the offer and die while bitterly and resentfully clinging to the [[Old]]. 

This is ok, and must be tolerated, as the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] does not allow any [[Conscious Agent]] to violate the [[Sovereignty]] and [[Free Will]] of another [[Conscious Agent]] in their respective [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]].  

No matter what other [[Responsibility]] and [[Authority]] is withdrawn from a [[Conscious Agent]] by other Conscious Agents, the Responsibility, Authority and Freedom to Govern ones Self is inalienable. 

Those who wish to reap the benefits, abundance, and joy that come from the New [[Way of Being]] within the boundaries of [[LIONSBERG]] are welcome.  

Those who do not want to honor and uphold the [[Lionsberg Code]] are welcome to remain outside the [[Lionsberg Boundary]].  

___
Invitations and voluntary consent from the bottom up. 

No [[Old]] / existing organization, institution, or system of governance can impose the [[Lionsberg System]] on its constituent beings from above, as this would violate the [[Sovereignty]] and [[Self Governance]] of those [[Individuals]]. 

However any existing organizations, institution, or system of governance can _invite_ its constituents to, in addition to their citizenship(s) in whatever existing forms, also take up their universal citizenship in [[LIONSBERG]]. 

The degree to which any [[Old]] system or domain is participating in [[LIONSBERG]] can be judged by evaluating where its population is at along the [[Lionsberg Adoption Curve]]. 

___
The short term objective between Q4 2022 and Q4 2029 is to continuously improve the [[Quality]] of [[LIONSBERG]] as a 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Experience that connects and empowers the universal "group of groups" / [[Force For Good]] as we advance together towards our overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]] within the boundaries of our overarching and uniting [[Universal Values]]. 

____
As outlined on the [[Lionsberg Adoption Curve]] page, 

The Lionsberg Adoption Curve is rooted in our [[Current Best Understanding]] of how human beings progressively adopt new ideas and technologies. 

## Way To Adopt - Small Groups

Our Hypothesis is that adoption should be done in small groups, who can [[Help One Another]] learn, localize, and adapt the [[Lionsberg System]] in the [[Wise Right]] to their own unique [[Time]] and [[Space]].  

This is critical in that it localizes the [[Authority]] and [[Responsibility]] for administering individual and local matters in small groups of 3 to 20, who even if they lack access to any technology at all, can use fundamental human processes to govern them selves. 

## Group Size - 3 to 20, Average ~ 7 

Positing a group size range of 3 to 20, and an average group size of 7, and 7.77 billion people adopting the system in 7 years, we have roughly a billion groups as a big target for humanity to [[Aim]] at. 

## Pattern of Adoption - Golden Ratio? 

If adoption pattern expands along roughly the Golden Ratio of 1.61803 expansion per reciprocal cycle, we would surpass 1 billion on the 44th cycle assuming zero loss rate. 

If we add is loss / attrition rates, the number of cycles changes as follows: 
- 0% Loss Rate - 44 Cycles
- 10% Loss Rate - 49 Cycles  
- 20% Loss Rate - 54 Cycles 
- 30% Loss Rate - 61 Cycles 
- 40% Loss Rate - 71 Cycles 
- 50% Loss Rate - 84 Cycles  
- 60% Loss Rate - 104 Cycles 
- 70% Loss Rate - 138 Cycles  
- 80% Loss Rate - 205 Cycles  
- 90% Loss Rate - 408 Cycles 
- 100% Loss Rate - The Movement Is Dead 

If the Movement dies, begin again with a new group of at least 3, and never give up, no matter how difficult, dangerous, or embarrassing it gets. 

## Time Function 

To the Pattern of Adoption, a time frame must be applied. 

The [[Aim]] is to hit 1 Billion Groups in 7 Years, or 2,555 days, starting in Q4 2022 and completed by Q4 2029. 

To bound the time function, that would require: 

- At 0% Loss Rate, a Cycle Time not exceeding 2,555 / 40 = 63.875 days 
- At 90% Loss Rate, a Cycle Time not exceeding 6.26 days 

## Hypothesis On Loss Rate

Based on our [[Current Best Understanding]], we have developed a hypothesis on the [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to experiment with,

- *If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of the 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg, we can hold [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to under 20%.* 

## Hypothesis On Expansion Rate

Based on our [[Current Best Understanding]], we have developed a [[Hypothesis]] on the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to experiment with: 

- _If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg, we can hold the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to under 42_

## Hypothesis On Success Rate

- _If we continuously improve the [[Quality]] of 1. Community 2. Platform and 3. Lived Experience of Lionsberg..._ 
- _...we can hold the [[Lionsberg Expansion Rate]] to under 42 days_
- _...while holding the [[Lionsberg Loss Rate]] to under 20%._ 
- _This results in 54 or fewer cycles at a [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of 42 or fewer days, leading to an anticipated Project duration of 54 x 42 = 2,268 or fewer days._ 
- _2,268 days / 365 = 6.2 years, leaving 0.8 years, or 9.6 months of float._ 
- _This will result in us being able to accomplish our [[Aim]] of connecting and empowering 1 billion [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] groups, encompassing 97% of humanity, around shared Goals and Values, within 7 years... 

These various ratios should be carefully monitored by the [[Program and Process Management Guild]], and made transparent and visible to [[All]]. 

___
What are we asking small groups to join? 

A Community, Platform, and Experience that will create the ability for a distributed network of sovereign and autonomous small groups to listen deeply to one another and [[Help One Another]] in the [[Wise Right]] [[Way]], at the Right Time, for the Right Reasons, to progress towards [[The Goal]].  

___
What groups can join Lionsberg? 

Any small group is welcome to join the Lionsberg Community / Platform / Experience provided that: 

1. They agree to honor and uphold the [[Meta Agreement]] and [[Universal Values]] 
2. There is an [[Agreement]] between the Group and the Lionsberg Community based on the [[Voluntary Consent]] of everyone involved  
3. They advance through the [[Process For Onboarding]]  
___
What individuals can join a small group? 

Any individual is welcome to join a small group provided that: 

1. They agree to honor and uphold the [[Meta Agreement]] and [[Universal Values]] 
2. They agree to honor and uphold the [[Group Agreement]] and [[Group Values]] 
3. There is an [[Agreement]] between the Group and the Individual based on the [[Voluntary Consent]] of everyone involved

___
What additional benefits is Lionsberg working to develop? 

Through the process of deeply listening to the problems, needs, and opportunities faced by individuals, organizations, and communities around the world on their [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]], Lionsberg is working to develop, in prioritized order of importance, a [[Prototype]] for Individual, Organizational, and Community Development that can be localized and instantiated in any [[Time]], [[Space]], or [[Context]]. 

This [[Prototype]] will contain [[General Solutions]] to the [[General Problems]], [[General Needs]], and [[General Opportunities]] faced by every community of Life as they strive to develop into the fullness of their unique potential and flourish. 

The [[Conditions Of Acceptance]] ensure that the [[Lionsberg System]] and Infrastructure reach out and connect to with every individual and group on earth that desires to develop towards the fullness of their potential, by helping all others do the same. 

___
How will Lionsberg prioritize the [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]] entrusted to it? 

Initially through the formative period, [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] will be responsible and accountable for working with the group of groups and a small [[Core Team]] and [[Core Enterprise]] to prioritize and 
allocate resources in response to problems, needs, and opportunities of the Community, and in accordance with the [[Critical Path]] / [[Critical Chain]] that governs [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

This will eventually develop into a far more sophisticated [[Goal Delivery System]], as pointed towards in the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery Guide]]. 

___
The [[Core Team]] and [[Core Enterprise]]

A small [[Core Team]] and [[Core Enterprise]] is being established to work with [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] to take in and synthesize information and communications from the distributed network of [[Sovereigns]], and send back out to the network communication, vision, and inspiration regarding both [[Where We Are]], and various potential plans / patterns of action into the future. 

___
[[Each Part Of The Body]] / [[Each Tile Of The Mosaic]]

Beyond this basic flow of Communication and [[Conscious Awareness]], we will begin to work with each of the [[Group Of Groups]] to discover their unique fit within the body / mosaic. 

"Body" and "Mosaic" are [[Metaphors]] we use to help us understand the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] we are [[All]] being invited up into. 

Since our near term [[Aim]] is one billion groups within 7 years, and since there is only ONE Body / Mosaic, composed of 1, 7, 12, or 144 major functions at various levels of analysis, it is clear that each major function or domain will eventually be composed of dozens, hundreds, or millions of groups with similar functions. 

Each Function / Domain / Tile will have (something like) a [[Guilds|Guild]] to cross-pollinate learning and [[Current Best Understanding]] across groups of similar function. 

The Guild will likely be responsible for integrating the aggregate work of its member groups, and representing the synthesis out to the [[Whole]]. 

There is not any one group or named thing that owns any one function... the explicit aim is to have redundancy and multiple functional groups within [[Each Part Of The Body]] / [[Each Tile Of The Mosaic]]. 

This also prevents any one group from being perceived as having either [[Favored Nation Status]], or being a [[Single Point of Failure]]. 

____

Rules of participation - the system is entirely based on self-governance, sovereignty, and autonomy in Community, so no one has to do anything other than the wise right thing to accomplish our shared overarching and uniting goal, within the boundaries of our shared universal values. Do the Right Thing, at the Right Time, for the Right Reasons, to progress the Whole towards the Goal.
