# Summer Quests Begin in Africa and Around the World  
A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
*Summer Solstice 2025*  

Greetings from East Africa! 

I would like to invite you into an adventure.  

A few weeks ago, I was mind-weaving in a sanctuary in Idaho when a prayer came in from the heart of East Africa. Food had run out for our precious children, and elders were having heart attack symptoms from the sheer stress of trying to hold schools and communities together without the basic resources to function and feed. The cries for help from afar created an internal conflict for some locally—how could we possibly care for suffering children in Africa, when our own children are suffering right here?  

*"Every woman who has given birth understands that every child is one of her children..."* one elder cried.  
*"We The People of Lionsberg will not have children going hungry..."* another added.  
Is that not True for All of Us?  

What would you do if you received such a prayer?  
If a dollar was sitting in your pocket while children you loved were suffering for lack of a **ten cent daily ration of gruel**?  

The Divine Intention is clear. *Love. If you Love, Care. If you Care, Act—starting with the least and most vulnerable.*  

Small amounts of resources began to be set in motion, and hundreds of lives were changed in small but profound ways.  

I pray that many of you would like to become part of such life saving and transformational work.

Over recent years, we have been co-creating a new community, platform, and operating system we call Lionsberg. It has been an incredibly difficult journey, but we are still progressing by the grace of God.  

It is purpose-built to empower us together to provide immediate solutions and relief to those most in need, while proactively searching out and solving the deeper systemic root causes over the medium to long term as we navigate together towards Heaven on Earth.  

Having discovered in 2024 that We The People do not actually have a functioning system of democratic self-governance—either in America or the world—Our mission now accelerates into connecting and empowering The First Three Percent of the population as rapidly as possible so that we can meet needs, solve problems, and navigate together towards The Goal. 

As we connect, a basic idea of the system is that it encourages individuals to self-organize into small autonomous **Circles**, and engage in meaningful **Seasonal Quests** that advance our lives, communities, and world towards our shared goals and values. 

As we cross over summer solstice, I am physically beginning my **Summer Quest** with the beautiful souls of East Africa, while collaborating with co-creators around the world. Would you like to join us? Support? Or simply follow along? 

There is endless need, and a place for everyone who loves and cares to contribute.

If like us, you refuse to stand idly by as children suffer  
and injustice reigns, please sign up below with a contribution  
of any amount to begin following along, supporting, or actively  
participating in the transformation of our lives and our world. 

Since a video seems to be worth 10,000 words, here is a brief video capturing the essence of what we have been doing in East Africa recently, and an invitation to continue the work together—here in Africa, and in your own community at home. Please excuse the quality. It was all shot on cell phones, and hacked together by me :).

Love and Blessings,
