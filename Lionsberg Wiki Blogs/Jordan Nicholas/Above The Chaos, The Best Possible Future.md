A post in [[Above The Chaos]].

Hello Friends and Allies, 

This morning I spent some time articulating thoughts the Vision and Feeling of the [[Best Possible Future]] that we must unwavering Aim at as we progress together towards The Goal. 

To create a starting point that we can continuously improve together, I wrote about a 1,500 word essay that I think approximately captures the spirit / essence of the kind of future that would flow from the heart of unconditional Love. 

I look forward to discussing and improving it together. 

As you read, think about how we might be able to [[Filling Up What Is Lacking|Fill Up What Is Lacking]] and [[Removing What Does Not Belong|Remove What Does Not Belong]] from the Old World in order to help make it more like the New World. 

Some might regard this kind of writing as foolish utopian nonsense. However there _might_ be a reason this kind of imagery has been passed down in sacred writings for thousands of years. 

If we are going to do something or go somewhere together, we must consciously Choose an Aim. 

If we must Aim at something, it would be foolish to Aim at anything other than the Best and Highest Future we can presently conceive of, even as we understand that our highest present conception barely scratches the surface of what is possible.
