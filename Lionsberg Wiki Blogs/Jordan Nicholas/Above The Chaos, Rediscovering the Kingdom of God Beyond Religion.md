# Above The Chaos, Rediscovering the Kingdom of God Beyond Religion

Once we [[Above The Chaos, Rediscovering God Beyond Religion|Rediscover God Beyond Religion]] and [[Above The Chaos, Rediscovering Christ Beyond Religion|Rediscover Christ Beyond Religion]], we can begin to rediscover the [[Kingdom of God]] beyond religion. 

When I say that our Mission, and the only Solution, is the [[Kingdom of God]], I am again speaking *definitionally*, not religiously. 

Theologically, philosophically, psychologically, socially, and politically, there is a choice between viewing the [[Configuration Space]] as a dis-integrated [[Plurality]], or through the lens of an [[Ultimate Unity]]. 

Again, *by definition*, the [[Ultimate Unity]] that integrates the [[Plurality]] at the [[Deepest]] level *is [[God]]*. The [[ONE]] that integrates, orders, and coheres the [[All]] within Itself. 

When it comes to the issue of [[Power]] and [[Authority]], we discover that the [[Way]] to rightly relate to the [[ONE]] is on the basis of the Ultimately Benevolent Kingship of God. 

We then discover that the Ultimate Sovereignty extant in [[God]] at the Unified Top of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Sovereignties]] flows directionally in an important Way that establishes [[Sovereignty]] at every level, from [[God]] directly to the [[Individual And Local]], and then up through each level of [[Voluntary Association]] on the basis of [[Free Will]] and ongoing [[Voluntary Consent]]. 

This crucially places each higher level of aggregated [[Power]] *in service to* the more automatized constituents that voluntarily consent to its aggregation and exercise, with the end logic that *the greatest in the Kingdom shall be the servant of All*.  It also creates the affirmative responsibility and authority of the [[All]] to progressively transform and conform any power or authority that is not serving them and God. 

In addition to reversing the [[Flow]] of Power and Authority on Earth to rise form the Bottom Up on the basis of Voluntary Consent, the [[Kingdom of God]] further requires that all Power and Authority on Earth voluntarily integrate, cohere, and harmonize itself within the Highest Order Uniting Framework of [[All]] in service of [[ONE]]. 

This solidifies the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] as the supreme objective, requiring all power and authority on Earth to collaborate to empower All Creation to progress together towards The Goal, which can be articulated as something like *the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All life and consciousness..  

The end result is decentralized self-governance according to the law of subsidiarity, voluntarily stacked up and aligned into a Highest Order Functional Unity actually capable of manifesting the Will and Intention of God [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

The post [[Above The Chaos, Sovereignty At Every Level]] goes deeper into the logic.
