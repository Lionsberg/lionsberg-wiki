# Above The Chaos, Provisional Platform For Action

The near term objective is to forge, out of the many enlightened individuals around the world, a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that is actually capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in this moment in the Story. 

**It is self-evident to those paying attention that**: 

1. We are entering a [[Meta Crisis]]. Billions are suffering unnecessarily. 
2. The [[Old]] systems and structures are corrupted and failing.  
3. It is up to [[Us]] to confront and overcome the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, and forge a more perfect [[New]] world that works for us [[All]].     

**In order for [[Us]] to succeed and avoid failure in this Mission:** 

1. [[We]] must coalesce free enlightened individuals and groups into some kind of functioning [[Group Of Groups]] / [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. None of us can succeed in isolation.     
2. We must help progressively enlighten, connect, and empower more individuals and groups to grow the [[The Movement]].      
3. We must ensure the tipping point strategy of awakening / enlightening / connecting / empowering unfurls itself along the right [[Time]] interval (universal invitation within in 7 years).    

**To prepare for this, [[We]] have**: 

1. Built a minimum viable shared Structure - [[Provisional Structure]]  
2. Built a minimum viable shared Backbone - [[Provisional Backbone]]  
3. Started a minimum viable shared Mind - [[Provisional Mind]]  
4. Articulated minimum viable shared Goals and Values - [[Universal Goals and Values]]  
5. Articulated the basic patterns of Organizing and Federating - [[Organizations The Lionsberg Way]] 
6. Built a minimum viable shared Brand - [Lionsberg](https:www.lionsberg.org)
7. Established a way to organize and federate a [[Group Of Groups]] that is self-sustaining, self-replicating, sovereign, autonomous, and independent of the [[Old]] systems and structures. 
8. Done many other things in preparation we hope will prove useful over time

Starting The Journey / Quest:
