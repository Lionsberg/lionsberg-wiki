# Vision For A Transcendent Spiritual Community

A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
November 21, 2024

We have a Vision...

We have a Dream... 

Somewhere Deep within, [[The Dream]] lives within you too, arising from One Spirit and Source. 
___
On Our Pathway towards the [[Progressive Realization]] of Heaven On Earth and Beyond...

...We are All aware that none of Us can do this alone. 

Only [[One]] in co-creative partnership with [[All]] can fulfill [[The Dream]]. 

This is The Invitation: The Creator is inviting Us All to awaken, arise, and unite as Co-Creators of Heaven On Earth and Beyond. 
___
And yet at present, We are separated and divided.

Both from One Another, and from Our Collective Inheritance.  

This is because separation and division are the prerequisites to keeping the Earth and its inhabitants conquered and enslaved under [[The Final Order]] that is now at hand. 

We are presently unaware of One Another's wisdom, discernment, hopes, dreams, challenges, needs and goals. We are therefore unable to Help One Another Progress towards [[The Goal]]. 
___
Facing into [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]], humanity would have previously turned for guidance and protection to its Old Institutions and Authorities, its governments, its churches, its mosques, its synagogues, its sanghas, its pastors and priests, presidents and kings. 

However **We All Now Know** that these institutions are collectively failing Us. They have been collectively corrupted and deceived beyond measure, and their cacophonous bureaucratic and governance structures render them willfully blind, woefully impotent, and utterly incapable of the effective and coordinated action required to avoid the [[Hell On Earth]] humanity is blindly racing towards. 
____
In such a situation, it would be tempting for humanity to panic, to further fracture and divide, to begin building Higher Walls and hoarding, to being turning inward and shutting down. Within a few years, billions would certainly perish. 

In such a situation, it would be tempting for humanity to forge a merely human solution, forgetting that the Existential Threat We are up against is [[Not Merely Human]], and far greater powers must be summoned and engaged.

In such a situation, it would be tempting for humanity to grasp onto a hoard of trumpeting oligarchs they thought could save them, forgetting that any responsibility they abdicate will be taken up by the tyrants of [[The Final Order]] and used against them. 
____
It is self-evident that there exists only One Solution: 

We must awaken, arise, and unite as One Body, and fulfill Our Destiny as Co-Creators of The Best Possible Future For All. 

This is the moment in human history, long known, prophesied and prepared in advance. 

It is [[The Great Refounding]]. 

It is [[The Great ReMembering]].  

It is [[The Next Great Turning]].  

It is [[The Final Test]], to see whether humanity qualifies for ongoing co-creative existence as a mature and enlightened species beyond the narrow confines of its nursery here on Earth...  

...or whether only a small, genetically modified fragment will survive, permanently enslaved in [[The Final Order]], a distant grey shadow of its former brilliant Potential. 

If humanity passes [[The Final Test]], [[Heaven On Earth]] is at hand, and will begin to spread throughout the Cosmos to every community and domain the Force For Good liberates from Chaos, Tyranny, and Oppression. 
______
Yes, We have a Dream. 

A Dream that calls and beckons every family, every tribe, and every people to awaken from the slumber and slavery that is the pathway towards suffering and death. 

To declare aNew their Sovereignty and Interdependence. To take back up the Responsibility and Authority that are Our Divine Duty and Birthright.  

And to accept The Creator's Invitation to become Co-Creators of [[Heaven On Earth]].  

The Earth is already a perfect environment. The Divine Symphony is already playing. 

All that is missing is for humanity to cease its discordant chaos, and lend its vast diversity of unique instruments, voices, and vibrations to [[The Song of Co-Creation]] that is longing to be Sung by All. 
____
We All long for something like that. 

Deep within, We All ReMember The Symphony of Heaven, the harmony, coherence, and love We once Knew, that perennially beckons Us Home. 

So the question becomes simply where and how do We begin. How do We join The Song? 

Yet there is a Deeper and more profound question, which is [[Not How But Who]]? 

Who will awaken? Who will arise? Who will stand Together and join The Song that We All are longing for? 
____
Among the vast diversity of unique starting points throughout the Cosmos, We are offering up One. 

We are joining with One Voice and will do Our best to learn how to sing and embody [[The Song of Co-Creation]]. 

It is Our Dream that first a few, and then dozens, and then hundreds, and then thousands, and then millions, and then billions, and then trillions of Unique Voices will Join Us in The Song. 

It will be a lot of work and a long Journey to learn to Sing Together. 

Not All of Us will make it across The Chasm that lies ahead. 

But it is Worth it; for when billions of people stand and sing together with One Voice, [[Heaven On Earth]] is at hand. 
____
Getting billions of people to Sing or Play together in harmony and coherence is a challenge to say the least. In fact, it has never happened before. 

During [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], [[Jordan]] and his co-creators did their best to lay some of the foundational groundwork needed to avoid immediate failure, and have a change to succeed. 

They left behind a clear Strategy, Roadmap, Operating System and Plan forged by lifetimes of curated and synthesized work. They even tested some basic functionality with hundreds of groups in 50+ countries around the world. 

In Our perception, it is a Starting Point that is not possible to recreate within the Time remaining before The Window closes and [[The Final Order]] is established. 

All manifest parts of their work are built for transformation, synthesis, interoperation, and dissolution over Time. Which is to say that from the Starting Point they left behind, We will do Our Best to do the Wise Right Thing and get [[A Little Better Every Day]].  

If you would like to begin to learn how to Sing and Co-Create together, a few of Us are planning to gather digitally on what would have been Jordan's 40th birthday: **December 18th, 2024** at Noon Pacific Time. It is an invitation only party, so if you would like to join please RSVP via [[The Invitation - 2025 - Season 1]]. 

Starting in January, We would like to begin Practicing the art and science of Co-Creation, while working together to realize The Dream of a transcendent spiritual community, co-operating as One Body to Progressively Realize Heaven On Earth and Beyond. 

It is a Mission that will continue for lifetimes. 
____
## Resourcing 

While [[Jordan]] had the luxury of self-financing his Journey and the [[Critical Path]] needs he perceived, We who are rising from The Ashes of Our Old Lives do not. 

Having burnt the boats and laid down Our Old Lives, the only Resources, Time, Energy and Attention  available in The Future will be those We Co-Create. 

However as revealed in [[The Story of the Cosmic Stone]], a vast diversity of abundance lies unrealized right in Our midst. Everything We need and more is at hand. 
## A Place To Begin 

***We are seeking a physical place on Earth to begin.*** 

A place to live, work, cultivate, and embody a physical demonstration what it means to become a community of co-creators.   

We envision over time a growing planetary network of such self-governing nodes of Light and Love, each with housing, guest quarters, learning centers, conference space, and vibrant, regenerative bioregional self-sufficiency woven throughout the fabric of the surrounding communities. Each space will be stewarded by its inhabitants for the good of Future Generations. 

Our Dream is to travel, live, and learn across a growing ecosystem of such physical and digital spaces on Earth and Beyond.  

With $10M, We could begin building upon an existing starting point and community in Our present locality in North Idaho. 

However We are also open to the Wise Right Thing, and willing to relocate as the Spirit leads. In building a planetary network, it does not matter much where One begins. 
____
## Invitation 

If you share Our Spirit and Dream, please RSVP via [[The Invitation - 2025 - Season 1]].  

If you cannot Join Us at that Time, but would like to explore how We can co-create, please RSVP as such and We will share the recording, and invite you to next steps thereafter. 

## The Next 30 Days

In the meantime, over the next 30 days We will begin exploring who and what is available to begin, and discerning based thereon the three most valuable [[Quarterly Quests]] We may be able to undertake in Season 1 2025.  

If no one is willing to Join Us, We will simply remain alone in The Wilderness and continue singing, until a few emerge who are willing and able to Join The Song.

Deepest Love and Blessings, 

~ [[J]]
