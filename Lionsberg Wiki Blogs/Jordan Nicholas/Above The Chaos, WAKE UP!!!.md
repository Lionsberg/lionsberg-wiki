# Above The Chaos, WAKE UP!!!   

Dear Loved Ones,  

If you can finally hear me, please listen. We are in grave danger, time is short, and we have to move.  

There is no easy way to say this, so I will say it forthrightly: 

*The Existing Order has failed, and our civilization is on the brink of collapse. You and your loved ones are asleep in a structure that is on fire. Do not be afraid. We have to move to safety. Now.*  

No one wants to hear bad news. The implications can be terrifying to consider. Everything within us wants to shut out the inconvenient Truth. Everything within us wants to believe that everything is fine; to close our eyes and go back to sleep. 

Everything is not fine. Something is deeply wrong. Our lives and society are at stake. Can you sense it? 

I wish I could say this in a simple winsome way, but this is not a simple winsome moment. 

At the risk of offending or inconveniencing you, 

***THE FUCKING BUILDING IS ON FIRE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE WAKE UP AND PAY ATTENTION SO YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DON'T SUFFER AND DIE IN THE COLLAPSE.***

Because we haven't lived through the collapse of a civilization, it is easy to forget that they can happen, and that they regularly and cyclically occur, for very predicable reasons. 

[[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]] offers a short refresher. The [[Fireside Chats]] cover similar ground. 

As a result of the corruption and failure of the Existing Order, we are now thrust against our will into something like a War for the future of life and society as we know it. This metaphysical War is already 'spilling over' into the physical realm in the wars in Europe and the Middle East, and the simmering tensions around the planet. 

As we look across the battlefield and see the vast array of monsters, it is crucial to look at the Meta Dragon from whose mouth they are flowing. The [[Visible Power Structures]] and politicians of the imperial structures such as Russia, China, the United States, the World Economic Forum, and Big Everything are merely puppets of the parasitical [[Invisible Power Structures]] possessing them. 

The only way to win this war is to address the root causes of Chaos, Conflict, and Collapse by vanquishing the Meta Dragon, liberating its captives, and co-creating the New. 

This requires a Great Awakening, a planetary shift of consciousness, and a fundamental transformation of our Way of Being as a human species aboard Worksite Earth. 

Nothing short of a Great Refounding of our civilization will suffice. The New Yet Ancient Foundations must be Rock Solid and able to endure through the millennia to come. 

The Creator of the Universe is inviting us into a New Covenant, whereby we arise, reunite, and become Co-Creators of Heaven on Earth. 

## The New Vision, Strategy and Plan

Over the last 7 years, I convened the wisest people I could find to forge a New Vision, System, Platform, Strategy, and Plan for the future of humanity aboard Earth. 

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] proposes that *without dishonoring or forsaking our existing citizenships and affiliations*, during the summer of 2024 we ratify a New Alliance and a New System of Governance transcendent of the lines that divided us in the past, connect and empower the first 3% of the population (250 million leaders strong) by 2026, and reallocate 2/3 of the $30 Trillion currently budgeted for an omnicidal World War III towards the greatest healing and rebuilding project in human history. 

The 250 Million strong Lionsberg Alliance / Force For Good will lead neighborhoods, communities, watersheds, and bioregions around the planet through a coordinated process of reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding their lives and their world. 

We will ensure that every family and community has the opportunity to forge coordinated Disaster Resilience and Recovery Plans to ensure that continuity of food, water, shelter, and necessities as the world transforms. 

The Lionsberg System, Commons, and Platform will connect every individual, family and locality on Earth to a world class array of solutions and technologies, and a lifelong journey of learning, wellness, and development. 

The Networked Instantiation Hubs will equip every community and watershed with the pragmatic physical and digital systems, tools, and technologies required to continually regenerate local social, economic, and ecological health. 

The Lionsberg Platform will enable intelligent supply chain management for critical goods and services, monitoring surpluses and needs, stocks and flows across the networked localities. 

And the New Covenant will ensure that all individuals and localities Help One Another develop towards the fullness of their unique potential, and flourish in harmony. 

I understand that it has been confusing the last 7 years to watch or ignore a builder from nowhere laboring in obscurity building an Ark to transport humanity FROM the Old TO the New... but now that the Storm Clouds are evident on the horizon and The Collapse is at hand, I am hoping and praying that humanity will heed the call and help one another out of danger and towards flourishing and abundant life. 

***TO AVOID A CENTURIES LONG BATTLE BETWEEN CHAOS AND TYRANNY THAT WILL APPROACH HELL ON EARTH, THE NEW AND HIGHER ORDER MUST BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE OLD ORDER COLLAPSES.***

***TO PREVENT RAPID COLLAPSE AND TRANSFORM OUR WEAPONS INTO TOOLS OF LIFE, THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT MUST BE SAVED.***

To avert a collapse of the Existing Order, the world must promptly ratify, embody and enact [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] or a genuinely superior alternative, and aggregate the virtually unlimited time, energy, and resources that will be required to successfully achieve it. 

If we are not meeting this moment in history with *at least* the basic competence, resources and focus with which we approached the Apollo Project or any significant Joint Venture, at planetary scale, we are not even in the ballpark of averting [[Collapse]].  

We plan to convene the first [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] on or about Sunday September 22, 2024 to ratify the New System and the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]].  

To avoid World War III and reallocate the world's largest military, defense, and logistical capacity towards co-creative ends, the world must help the Citizens of America sweep an independent President into office in 2024 who is committed to dissolving the abjectly corrupt Deep State and leading the world through a progressive disarmament over the coming decade. 

I have not identified any candidates forthrightly committed to this, so as an alternative should no adequate option appear, I am registering as an independent write in candidate without wasting time and money to campaign. In [[Mondragon]] they developed a social rule that anyone who campaigns is disqualified. Not a bad idea. 

To take immediate action, please [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement), contribute whatever time and resources you are able, and [[Pass The Flame]] to your loved ones and network. 

Our near term aim is to aggregate $10M in working capital against the tens of millions of dollars of value aggregated in The Commons thus far, while putting together a federated pursuit of the $100M MacArthur grant that is due in September with appropriately qualified partners. We will subsequently market the federated proposal to significant aligned granting organizations around the world to raise at least $100M by 2025 and $1 Billion by 2026. By the end of 2026 we aim to have at least 50 million teams engaged in quarterly quests averaging at least $10,000, creating *half a trillion dollars of Value a quarter.* We have built the systems and technology to resource and measure this ecosystem of value creation in stride. 

Leadership and management training for [[The First Three Percent]] begins in June, and [[The Invitation, Cycle 9|you are invited]].  

In the event you would like to dialogue or have Jordan present to your group, please gather a small group of 3 to 16 interested individuals together and email [[Jordan]] to schedule a video call. 

It's time to advance quickly and wisely towards [[The Goal]]. 

With deep love and desire for none to suffer and all to inherit flourishing and abundant life and liberty, 

~ J
