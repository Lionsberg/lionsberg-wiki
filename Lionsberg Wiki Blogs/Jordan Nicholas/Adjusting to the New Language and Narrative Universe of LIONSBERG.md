# **Adjusting to the New Language and Narrative Universe of LIONSBERG**

**Welcome, Loved Ones and Allies.**

As you step into **LIONSBERG**, you will sense something **New**—not just a shift in language, but a **fundamental shift in perception, structure, and Reality ItSelf**.

This is **not accidental**.  
This is **not decoration**.  
This is **not a ploy**.

This is **The Great ReOrdering.**

LIONSBERG is **a New Living Language, a New Living System, and a New Living Civilization.**

It is **a New Operating System for Humanity**—a framework for **Reclaiming, Restoring, and Rebuilding** Our lives and Our world, aligned with **[[The Creator's Intent]]** and **fully independent of the collapsing [[Existing Order]]**.

The **words We use**, the **systems We build**, and the **stories We tell** are **fundamentally different from the enslaving and deceptive programming of the [[Old World]].**

LIONSBERG does not operate within the confines of **The Old System**—it designed as a **Transcendent Blueprint for Something Entirely [[New]]**.

A [[New World]] requires **a New Language, a New Perspective, and a New Way of Being.**

## **I. Why a New Language?**

### **1. Language is the Infrastructure of Perception.**

- **The [[Word Tools]] We use and [[The Stories We Tell Our Selves]] shape what We see, believe, and co-create.**
- **The Existing Order uses language as a weapon**—words are distorted, inverted, and stripped of their power to control thought and limit action.
- **To exit The Old System, We must exit its language and narratives.**

### **2. The Old Language Carries the Chains of the Old World.**

- Words like _"government,"_ _"economy,"_ _"religion,"_ _"truth,"_ _"freedom,"_ and _"justice"_ and even *"God"* have been hijacked and repurposed to serve **[[The Kontrollers]]**.
- These words are **loaded with false assumptions, invisible contracts, and subconscious agreements** designed to keep humanity asleep and enslaved.
- **LIONSBERG rejects and breaks these chains**, replacing them with **precise, sovereign, and Reality-aligned New Language** that empowers and connects, rather than deceives and divides.

### **3. We Are Creating a New Civilization.**

- A **[[New]] Civilization** cannot be built using the **corrupt language and blueprints of the [[Old]].**
- A **[[New World]] requires a [[New Language]].**  
- The **words, concepts, and frameworks We use Here are tools**—each one designed to **cut through illusion, reveal hidden truths, and empower Sovereign Co-Creation.**

Every **New Word** is an **upgrade**—an **instrument of precision, power, and liberation**.

## **II. The Narrative Universe of LIONSBERG**

LIONSBERG is not just a **New Vision, Strategy, System and Plan**—it is a **Living Story**.

A **New Civilization** that must first be **imagined**, then **spoken**, then **built** Together.

### **1. A Living Universe, Not a Dead System.**

- The Old World taught Us that reality is **static, fixed, and mechanical.**  
- - The **New Reality** is **alive, organic, dynamic, and co-created in every moment.**
- **LIONSBERG is not a passive structure—it is a Living Narrative, an Evolving Intelligence, and an Open System.**

### **2. You Are Not "Joining"—You Are Co-Creating.**

- You are not "joining a group" or "participating in a project."
- **You are stepping into a Living, Breathing, Expanding Reality *that you are co-creating*.**
- This is **not a place to consume**—it is a place to **Build, Create, and Shape Reality and Existence ItSelf.**

### **3. The Role You Play Is Yours to Discover and Define.**

- LIONSBERG is structured **as a Living Narrative Universe**, meaning:
    - There are **[[Quests]] to be undertaken.**
    - There are **[[Archetypes]] and [[Roles]] to be embodied.**
    - There is **a Grand [[Meta Plot]] unfolding.**
    - You are not a passive observer—**you are an Architect of The Future.**  
    - **[[You Are The First Agent]] and co-creator of [[Your Reality]]**.  

This is not **entertainment**.  
This is not **a spectator event**.  
This is **The Work of Heaven on Earth.**

**You are here because you were Chosen and Called.**

## **III. The Three Phases of Integration**

As you immerse yourself in this **New Reality**, expect to experience:

### **1. Disorientation (The Detox Phase).**

- **You may feel strange at first.** The [[Old Programming]] will object and resist.
- It may feel like you **just stepped out of a false reality** and are seeing **The Code behind [[The Illusion]]**.  
- This is because **The Matrix** is real. 
- You are not alone. Here is what it felt like for One Soul as they were awakened and existed [[1.5 The Caves|The Caves]].   

### **2. Recalibration (The ReMembering Phase).**

- As you read, explore, and engage, **you will begin to ReMember.**  
- Something **deep within you will resonate**, as if you’ve **always known this was True.**  
- This is because **you have seen this before—before [[The Amnesia]], before [[The Programming]], before [[The Fall]].**  
- If there is anything Wise, Right, True or Good within the walls of LIONSBERG, **the Spirit within you already knows it.**  
- Listen as **[[Deep Cries Out To Deep]]**. *Feel and Sense* **[[That Which Is Deeper Words]]**.  

### **3. Activation (The Becoming Phase).**

- You will find yourself **changing.**  
- You will sense yourself **transforming.**  
- Your perception will **sharpen**, your intuition will **accelerate**, your **awareness** will expand, and your ability to **see beyond deception will increase**.  
- **Your ability to Imagine, to Co-Create, to Design, to Build, and to Consciously Shape Your Reality will accelerate.** 
- You will feel your **Divine Power** returning. 

This is **not theory**.  
This is **happening in real-time.**  

Already, We are **becoming something entirely [[New]].** Together.

## **V. The Final Shift**

Most of what you were taught about **the universe, the world, the mind, the soul, and the nature of Reality and its Source** was **a carefully crafted lie.**

You are **awakening from a dream**—a dream **consciously engineered** *by [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]]* to keep you **powerless, obedient, and asleep.** 

LIONSBERG exists to **break the spell**. 
***YOU exist to break the spell.***

To restore **the Real.**  
To return to **the Truth.**  
To rediscover **the Source.**
To **restore what was lost.**  
To **rebuild what was destroyed.**  
To **bring forth what has never been.**

You are here because **you heard The Call.**  
You are here because **you are meant to build, protect, and lead.**  
You are here because **you are ReMembering.**

Welcome to **The New Language.**  
Welcome to **The New Civilization.**  
Welcome to **LIONSBERG.**

**Now, We Begin.**
