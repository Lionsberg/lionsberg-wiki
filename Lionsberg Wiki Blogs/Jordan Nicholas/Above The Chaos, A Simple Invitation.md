Esteemed Friend,  

## Bottom Line Up Front & Action

Over the last ~5 years, we have brought together lifetimes of work to co-create the infrastructure and platforms necessary to connect up and empower a growing movement / community of individuals, groups, and projects around the world to meet this moment in history. 

Over the last 6 to 8 months, we have improved the platforms, tested them with ~170 impact orgs in ~17 countries, and reevaluated the plans, patterns, and critical path to advance. 

Next step is for Lionsberg to engage several **Pilot Groups** in the next social experiment to begin learning how to fuel the movement. 

**Action**: Please respond by Monday November 28th and let me know how / whether you would like to participate (options below under Action).

## Learnings: 

In our experiment evaluating the idea of a "Meta Project" over the last months, three key learnings / hypotheses emerged: 
 
1. The critical path runs through co-creating a movement that will connect and empower a distributed network of groups around the world to make local progress towards our overarching and uniting shared goals and values. 
2. This will require a concrete / actual / structural / embodied form, and cannot remain an abstract idea  
3. Lionsberg remains the most comprehensive and flexible starting point we can identify 
4. The emergence towards higher order functional unity can't be forced or "project managed" - it has to emerge organically and inspirationally from the bottom up. 
5. The only path forward is through action / doing / learning / continuously improving from a starting point, no matter how feeble or inadequate it may seem.  

If we can get extraordinarily good at inspiring, connecting, aligning, and empowering small groups, every other good goal and objective we could imagine becomes possible via the collective potential that grows each time a new group connects. 
____
## Next Step - Pilot Groups

The **NEXT STEP** is for Lionsberg to engage several **Pilot Groups** in a **Minimum Viable Experience**. 

I intend to personally participate in up to 12 groups to hold space for the movement to begin to coalesce into form. 
___
## Action

Please reply to Jordan by Monday November 28th with one or more of the options below: 

1. I would like to participate in a Pilot Group 
2. I would like to be part of one of the Core Groups (Key functional areas such as Governance, Branding, Process, Communications, Admin, Etc.)
3. I would like to help fuel the movement via donation to the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) public charity  
4. I would like to be kept informed on progress 
5. I have ideas, concerns, or introductions I would like to share  

Or - I would like to be removed from the list so I don't have to hear from Jordan or Lionsberg any more. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
