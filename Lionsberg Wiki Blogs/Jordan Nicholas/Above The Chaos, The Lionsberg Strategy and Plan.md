Now that some of the [[Wise Right People]] are engaged and it is becoming more possible to Believe, the time seemed right to further articulate and concretize the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], Plan, and Budget. 

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] lays out the ~$15 Trillion, 10 year budget for the largest joint venture in human history, coupled to a gradual redirection of the military expenditures and government and economic waste of humanity towards Trillions of dollars of meaningful [[Quarterly Quests]] that advance us along the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]], leading towards [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]] by 2034. 

As of March 1, 2024, the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] is underway. As of April 2024, we are slightly ahead of schedule. It is entirely possible if enough people awaken, unite, and believe, quickly enough. Who knows how long [[The Window]] will remain open. 

The strange thing is, it appears we only need $2 Million to $10 Million to start [[The Snowball]] that reallocates trillions of dollars of socioeconomic flow.
