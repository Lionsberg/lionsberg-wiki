# Above The Chaos, Wake Up! The Building Is On Fire!

Wake Up! The Building Is On Fire! 

I know you may not be able to hear me *yet*, but please, wake up! 

You and your family are asleep in a building that is on fire. As you have been sleeping, saboteurs have corrupted the structures, crippled the systems, and kindled the flames. 

But wait! Be careful. If you are not wise you are going to rush out of the fire and into a the flames of another trap that lies in wait. 

My current best understanding is that we are now in the battle for the future and freedom of our life and society. It is time to begin immediate and concerted action. 

Having already sacrificed my wealth, positions, and power to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of the corrupted and failing institutions of the Old World and prepare for battle, it is now time to risk my life and reputation to speak out the truthful words and Logos that I pray will bring forth the future that is most Good for All. 

My best understanding is that we are in the opening stages of a period of time which future generations will define as the inflection points between eras. There are the cycles of heartbeats, of breaths, of the moon, of the earth, of the solar system, of the galaxy, and of the universe. Just as we witness the seasons come and go, so too do we occasionally find ourselves standing at the moment of transition between epochs. I believe we are at such a time. 

Over the coming years it is likely that the already creaking and groaning systems of the Old World will lurch towards failure. Their corruption and failings is already being revealed at an accelerating rate that will continue to gain momentum. 

Look at what is happening with the monetary systems. Look at what is happening with the central banks. Look at what is happening with the political parties. Look at what is happening with the debt. Look at what is happening with the hot wars. Look at what is happening in the cold wars. Look at what is happening in the Middle East. Look at what is happening in China. Look at what is happening in Russia. Look at what is happening in the Middle East. Look at what is happening in South America. Look at what is happening in Africa.

Look at what is happening with anxiety, depression, and suicide. 

Enough. If you haven't woken up to the Meta Crisis, PLEASE... wake up. 

Over the coming years, the corrupt and failing systems of the Old World will lurch towards a massive transformation. Their demise will be urged on by those drooling over power vacuum that will be left behind. The talks and preparations are well underway for the moment when humanity hands their wealth, power, and liberty over to the totalitarian system of control that will promise peace and security in exchange for... everything. 

The decision not to wake up and move together now is a decision to accept whatever "they" decide is the solution and the next system. It will not be Good. 

Nor will we have time or the ability to construct a parallel system once a new system of control is established. 

There is a very short window of time **NOW** to get organized and move. Together. Towards The Goal. 

There is a lot remaining to be done, but it is going to require a **New Vision, System and Plan** with *at least* the level of thought, planning, systems work, and coordinated action outlined in [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]. 

If we succeed, we can beat our weapons into tools of life, and ensure a standard of of living, purpose, meaning, and conscious agency for every being that is better than any enjoyed in the Old World.
