# July 2025 - A Moment of Truth

I had given myself until July 1, 2025 to allow things get a little worse, and see who cares. It appears that date may pass in silence.  

A few more battles.  
A few more bombs dropped.  
A few more children starved to death.  
A few more citizens shot in the head for daring to speak.  
A few more doors kicked down in fascist raids.  
A few more of our loved ones dead.  
A few more trillions of debt.  
A few more ET contacts.  
A few more AI contracts.  

Have We had enough yet?  

Can you feel your Self being herded down the cattle shoot?  
By whom?  
Where do you think it leads?  

July 2025 feels like a moment of Truth.  
If We don't activate and self-organize Now, perhaps we will be able to try again in August. Perhaps not.  

If We continue doing what We are doing, is it enough?  
If We continue along Our present path, does it take Us to where We want to go?  
How long do you sense We have to change course?  

Is it not obvious that [[What Got Us Here Will Not Get Us To Where We Want To Go]]?  
#### **Your presence matters immensely. The Time is Now.**
