# Above The Chaos, The Invitation

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

Having forged a bounded Domain that can only be entered through voluntary mutual consent... 

...and having populated the domain with the requisite infrastructure, systems, and technology...

...and having built and tested platform in the open with hundreds of organizations in dozens of countries around the world...

...and having learned that the [[Individual]] is the only unit of agency that can resonate and respond quickly and reliably enough... 

... we are now beginning the process of inviting *Individuals* into an Invitation Only [[Tipping Point Strategy]] to forge a More Perfect Union on the basis of Free Will, reciprocity, and voluntary consent. 

In other words, to play a New Game together. 

[[The Invitation]] to the first few players in Cycle 1 is drafted, and will be continuously improved by the Players in each of the [[Cycles of Expansion]] as we progress through the [[Milestones]] that mark the Way towards [[The Goal]].
