A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

Sitting in a coffee shop this week, I overhead some people comparing [[Journaling Questions]] and discussing the transformational impact of journaling on daily life. 

I thought I would both join and invite you into the dialogue. If you have any ideas to improve these questions and their place in [[Daily Practice]] and the [[Lionsberg System]], please let know. 

You can find the journaling questions I have developed over the years here: [[Journaling Questions]]
