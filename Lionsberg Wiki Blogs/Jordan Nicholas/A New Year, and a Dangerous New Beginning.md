# A New Year, and a Dangerous New Beginning

Dear Loved Ones,

As the holidays fade and we step into 2025, we find ourselves at one of the most pivotal and dangerous chapters in humanity’s [[Journey]] aboard [[Worksite Earth]]. 

The stakes could not be higher. The wisdom and discernment of each individual, family, and community will determine the [[Path]] forward—towards life or suffering, freedom or chains, flourishing or [[Collapse]].

This is because [[The Final Test]] we face cannot be passed by isolated individuals or groups. It is a test for humanity as a whole, and it can only be passed together.

2024 confirmed what many of us feared: the Existing Order is beyond salvage or transformation. Its corruption runs far deeper than we imagined, and its structures are incapable of addressing the crises at hand.

With the "democratic super cycle" of 2024 behind Us and the status quo upheld, the [[Invisible Power Structures]] are accelerating their push toward [[Full Spectrum Dominance]]—the establishment of [[The Final Order]] on Earth and beyond.

In private briefings over the past two years, many of us were introduced to battle maps that included not only human institutions but _**star systems and extraterrestrial civilizations**_. These maps made it clear that the forces we face are coordinating far beyond the reaches of any constitutional authority on Earth, manipulating the [[Visible Power Structures]] humanity has long trusted.

In 2024, what had long been dismissed as “conspiracy theories” became mainstream headlines: **Humanity Is Not Alone**. Senior military and defense leaders admitted to decades-long extraterrestrial collaboration and reverse-engineering programs.

As the corruption, deception, and illegitimacy of the Existing Order come to light, humanity faces a profound question:

Can We rise—maturely, resolutely, and united—to take up Our sovereign and rightful place among the powers of the cosmos?

This realization compelled Us to pull back from the realm of national politics and reevaluate the [[Critical Path]]. The [[Nation-State]] is powerless to address the inherently local, planetary, and interplanetary challenges before us. Its corruption and illegitimacy render it obsolete.

While many are still awakening to these realities, the implications are profound: _**Human civilization must be forthrightly re-founded within a single generation.**_

## The Path Forward

The formula for passing [[The Final Test]] is not easy, but it is **simple**:

1. **Remove Consent and Energy from the Existing Order.** Stop fueling systems that perpetuate suffering, exploitation, and division.
2. **Awaken and Unite [[The First Three Percent]] by 2026.** This group must lead humanity in overcoming the [[Meta Crisis]] and forging a [[New Era]].
3. **Develop [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams, Groups, and Localities.** Each must stand independently, while cooperating harmoniously with others.
4. **Adopt the New Patterns and Protocols from the [[Bottom Up]].** Interoperability and harmony must emerge organically through voluntary poly-centric adoption of the [[New Paradigm]].  
5. **Extend [[The Invitation]] to Humanity by 2030.** Ensure that no individual or locality is [[Involuntarily Left Behind]].

This task is monumental, and the risks of failure are immense. After all, humanity has never consciously reorganized itself at this scale before.

Yet, consider this: just 20 years ago, few people on Earth had a smartphone or a social media account. Within two decades, humanity voluntarily adopted these innovations on a global scale.

We know this level of transformation is possible. The [[New]] must connect every individual, family, and community to its [[Collective Inheritance]] of everything needed to flourish in harmony with [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]].

## Overcoming the Competition to Save the World

A thousand groups recognize both the scale of the crisis and the shape of the emerging solution. Yet, [[The Competition to Save the World]]—the uncoordinated and often conflicting efforts of well-meaning groups vying to implement their vision of salvation— has hindered collective progress for years.  

[[Time]] is now short. According to many elders and stewards, we have only 24 months to awaken and unite [[The First Three Percent]].

## An Invitation

Over the past seven years, we have poured lifetimes of wisdom and effort into the foundations for this movement. Through social experiments and deep learning, we have reached a critical juncture.

As we step into 2025, we are recommitting and raising the bar:

- Higher standards for commitment and participation
- Rigorous training and accountability
- Careful measurement of capacity and progress at every level  

The mandate is clear: We are building an [[Army of Leadership, Light, and Love]] to confront and overcome the challenges ahead.

To ensure unity and efficiency in our efforts, we will be leveraging the Lionsberg System—a purpose-built framework designed to enable seamless coordination and growth as a [[Team of Teams]]. This system has been developed with the collective wisdom of years of experimentation and refinement, and it will serve as the foundation for Our shared efforts.

 ### **We Are Seeking Two Key Relationships:**

1. **Members of [[The First Three Percent]]** (Nomination and Invitation Only)  
2. **Stewards of Resources** to fund progress along the [[Critical Path]]  

We will be leveraging the purpose-built Lionsberg System to coordinate and move as a [[Team of Teams]]. 

If you are part of [[The First Three Percent]], a steward of resources, or know someone who fits either role, we ask you to reach out and begin the conversation.

Together, we can forge the [[Path]] to humanity’s awakening and collective triumph.

In Light, Leadership, and Love,

~ Us All
