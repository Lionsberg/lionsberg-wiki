# Above The Chaos, January 2024 Letter to Friends, Loved Ones, and Network

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.01.22 _(updated 2024.01.22)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

Dear friends, loved ones, and allies, 

As most of you are aware, from 2020 through 2023 our life transformed dramatically. [[Jordan's Short Story]] provides a broad overview of our path to date and the battles and transformations over the last years as we laid down our old life and were reborn into this new season. 

I know each of you are also living through your own story of tragedy and triumph, suffering and joy, as our world shakes and resets. 

As we wake up in January 2024, we find ourselves still alive, refined by fire, and facing into the extraordinary privilege of starting anew and doing all we can to meet this crucial moment in history. 

____
I am writing this letter to reconnect with old and new relations, share my heart, vision and passion, and invite those who resonate back into community and right relationship.

In short, there is a high non-zero probability that the existing order is in the process of collapsing across multiple levels simultaneously (governance, economy, society, spirituality, ecology). 

It is up to Us to proactively and consciously forge the New. Before it is too late.

Let's reimagine, redesign, and rebuild. Together, anything is possible.

## Learnings 

In the links above and the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], I have done my best to lay out my basic understanding of where we are at as a society, what is at stake, and a vision, strategy, and plan for a radical citizen-led response and transformation. 

Over the last couple years I formulated these ideas and presented them to a variety of existing networks and organizations. Many promising discussions resulted, but ultimately I learned that the immune systems, incentives, and power dynamics of existing structures, coupled with my own inadequacies, eventually crush the green shoots. 

The good news is that all the systems, infrastructure, and technology are now in place to enable us, individual citizens, to immediately organize and advance together. 

## My Dream 

My dream is to spend each day of my existence inspiring, serving, empowering, and transforming alongside those who want to move together to meet this moment in history. 

Out of many, to forge One free and united Force For Good actually capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems,  and working together in partnership with God and One Another to forge the Best Possible Future for All.  

## Forging Community 

To advance in this direction, our next step is to begin assembling a persistent community / movement, one individual at a time, to help one another progress together towards this definite Aim.  

## Action 

If you resonate and would like to advance together into this new season, please visit www.JordanNicholas.org and click [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement). 

The form will collect a donation of any amount and contact information to connect you to the communication system.  

I will communicate no later than February what our next steps are based on what people and resources are available to advance with.  

My prayer and intention is to aggregate sufficient resources through the Lionsberg non-profit to enable a small team to focus on serving this crucial Mission full time. 

Welcome to a new season of relationship, and the adventure of a lifetime. 

It is a joy and an honor to be on the Path with you, and to serve and transform alongside you as we advance together towards [[The Goal]]. 

With Love, Passion, and Conviction, 

~ J
