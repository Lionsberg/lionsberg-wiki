# EuCatastrophe

One of the places humanity can turn to discover [[What Is Going On Around Here]] is J.R.R. Tolkien, and [[The Lord of the Rings]] saga. The [[LIONSBERG Narrative Universe]] incorporates some of the True ideas reflected therein. 

**EuCatastrophe** is a [[Neologism]] coined by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] from the Greek ευ- ("good") and καταστροφή ("to overturn"). It describes a seemingly devastating or insurmountable situation, which at the very end transforms to the [[Good]]. 

[[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]] will feel like an **EuCatastrophe** to many. 

While the masses mourn and lament the [[The Collapse]] of the [[Old]], something massive, Divine, and Good will suddenly rise [[Rise From The Ashes]] like a [[Phoenix]]. 

This is a product of both the Faith, Hope, and Geniune [[Best Effort]] of [[The Protagonists]] in [[The Story]], and the overriding Divine Intention, Grace, and Assistance that perennially pours forth from Beyond.
