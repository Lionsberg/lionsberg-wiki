# A Note To The Resource Stewards

Among the many gifts and responsibilities distributed among the Earth is one very important and timely function that We have not quite figured out: 

**Stewardship of Resources**. 

Enlightened Beings of Goodwill understand that nothing We "own" is really Ours. 

[[All]] aspects of [[Reality]] are unique parts of [[One Body]], and the energy, attention, and resources temporarily aggregated in any aspect of The Body Ultimately "belong" to the non-dualistic [[One]] and [[All]].

We are born, We accumulate, We distribute, and We return to the dust of [[All]] in [[One]]. 
____
The question, responsibility, and accountability is what We do with the resources We are temporarily entrusted with during Our brief Journey through Earth.
____
At present, We are unable to locate a function of the [[One Body]] that effectively distributes resources in the [[Wise Right]] Way. 

At present, [[Resources, Energy, and Attention]] are distributed in way that is at ~ 90% waste, fueling the accelerating and [[Omnicidal]] destruction of the planet, and the human species and civilization thereon. 
___
As a result, many of the [[Heroes On The Front Lines]] are wasting a vastly disproportionate amount of their [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] trying to figure out how to survive, protect and preserve their families, and advance their missions. 
___
We (collectively) have Now less than 7 years to redirect ***trillions*** of dollars of [[Flow]] to confront and overcome the challenges and evil at hand, refound Our civilization, and co-create the New World. 
___
Throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], [[Jordan]] sacrificed his $10M+ of personal wealth and did his best to resource, gravitate and co-create the $ Tens of Millions of foundational systems, processes and infrastructure required to meet this moment in history. 

At the time of his death, [[Jordan]] and his co-creators estimated that it would take at least 5 years and $50 Million to recreate the foundational work already accomplished. 

However there is a catch...

...the [[Starting Point]] they forged could actually never be recreated, because 5 years from Now is 2030, and by then *everything is already going to be decided.* 
___
[[Jordan's Final Report]] reveals the shocking secrets that were UnVeiled through his life and death.  

If True, his Journey uncovered [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]. 

If True, humanity is not alone in the universe, nor anywhere near the top of the local food chain here in this galaxy. 
___
**We would like to carry on this Mission.**

We would like to continue to build on the foundations already in place, fulfill Our Purpose, and meet this moment in history. 

Doing so requires resources. 

___
Twenty or thirty thousand dollars a month lets a few of Us eat, live, co-create and do Our best to serve and empower the emerging Force For Good. 
___
The first $2M to $10M is the basic ante for any reasonably significant joint venture. 

___
$20M+ allows Us to begin development of a physical place-based demonstration project, learning center, and community of Practice. 

___
And of course the full fractal buildout of the requisite infrastructure, superstructure, and technology for the New World is ~ $100 Trillion of ecosystemic resource flows over the next 30 years. 

___
As We restructure Our life and work to survive the battles ahead and build on the foundations Jordan's Story left behind, We are seeking a small, deeply aligned group of resource stewards to secure runway and a physical home for The Mission into the future.

If you take a look at Jordan's Story and think something like "Wow... that is a lot of work. I would like to see this continue"...
