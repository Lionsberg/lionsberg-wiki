# A Note To The Resource Stewards

Among the many gifts and responsibilities distributed among the Earth is one very important and timely function: 

**Stewardship of Resources**. 

Enlightened people of Goodwill understand that nothing We "own" is really Ours. 

[[All]] aspects of [[Reality]] are part of [[One Body]], and the energy, attention, and resources temporarily aggregated in any aspect of The Body Ultimately "belong" to the non-dualistic [[One]] and [[All]].

We are born, We accumulate, We distribute, and We return to the dust of [[All]] in [[One]]. 
____
At present, there does not exist a function of the [[One Body]] that effectively distributes resources in the [[Wise Right]] Way. 

In fact, at present, [[Resources, Energy, and Attention]] are distributed in way that is at least 90% waste, fueling the accelerating and [[Omnicidal]] destruction of the planet, and the human species thereon. 
___
As a result, many of the [[Heroes On The Front Lines]] are wasting a vastly disproportionate amount of their [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] trying to figure out how to survive, preserve their families, and advance their missions. 
___
We (collectively) have Now less than 7 years to redirect ***trillions*** of dollars of [[Flow]] to confront and overcome the challenges and evil at hand, refound Our civilization, and co-create the New World. 
___
Throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], [[Jordan]] sacrificed $10M+ of personal wealth and did his best to resource, gravitate and co-create the $ Tens of Millions of foundational systems, processes and infrastructure required to meet this moment in history. 

At the time of his death, [[Jordan]] and his co-creators estimated that it would take at least 5 years and $50 Million to recreate the foundational work already accomplished. 

However there is a catch...

...the [[Starting Point]] they forged could never be recreated, because over the next 3 years *everything is going to change.*
___
[[Jordan's Final Report]] reveals the shocking last secrets that were revealed through his suffering and death.  

If True, his Journey uncovered [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]. 

If True, humanity is not alone in the universe, nor anywhere near the top of the local food chain. 
___
We would like to carry on his Mission.

We would like to fulfill Our Purpose and meet this moment in history. 

However Rising From The Ashes of his Old Life, We can only advance in proportion to the resources, relationships, and energy entrusted to Us. 

If The Mission is to continue, We need help and support. 
___
After sacrificing his entire $10 Million+ net worth, one of the last pockets of resources of Jordan's Old Life is a life insurance policy with a ~$15k cash value. 

We will liquidate it to secure another x weeks of existence as We begin aNew. 
___
There is not time to reinvent or recreate the PathWay Jordan and the emergent army of co-creators walked. 

We are here. Available. Incarnate on Earth to meet this moment in history. 
___
Would you be willing to resource a little more of the PathWay towards reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding human civilization aboard Earth, before it is too late? 

___

Twenty or thirty thousand dollars a month lets a few of Us hold space and do Our best to gravitate and convene the Force For Good. 
___

The first $2M to $10M is the basic ante for any reasonably significant joint venture. 

___

The first 10 prototypes of full sovereign, free, empowered, self-sufficient, regenerative communities / arks of ~10,000 individuals will be ~$10 Billion ($100,000 / Individual). 
___

And of course the full fractal buildout of the requisite infrastructure, superstructure, and technology for the New World is ~ $100 Trillion, a mere fraction of the [[Real Wealth]] of Earth.
