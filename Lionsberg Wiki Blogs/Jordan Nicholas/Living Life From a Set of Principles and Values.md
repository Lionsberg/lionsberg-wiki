# Living Life From a Set of Principles and Values

A Post in Above The Chaos

***From a local community member***: "I am intrigued with this idea of living life from a set of principles / values. I've heard this type of thing before, but something about being the right person, in the right place type of thing. Maybe I'm finally ready for such a thing. Something that's been on my mind these last few days."

***Thoughts***: There is a Way of being, essentially defined by a set of [[Principles]], [[Values]], and [[Protocols]], that optimally positions and conditions [[Us]] in Universe for peak [[Purpose]], [[Passion]], [[Meaning]], [[Creativity]], [[Wellness]], [[Flow]], etc. Discovering and deepening this Way is, to many of Us, the center of [[Daily Practice]] and Existence. The more one personally experiences what lies at **The Center** of this, the more intoxicating [[The Journey]] becomes. What a amazing point it is when We notice that We are finally ready for What Matters Most. Honor and respect for the next phase of [[(y)Our]] [[Awakening]].
