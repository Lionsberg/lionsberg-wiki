# The Prayers and Cries of Our BeLoved
A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
*05.27.2025*

The prayers and cries of Our Beloved have finally shattered Our hearts. 

Not to break them, but to liberate them to Rise Together as One.  

We are just Now Beginning to ReMember Who We Are,  
yet already, We Are Rising Together.  

How much longer shall We remain **Kaptured**  
as **Employee Consumer Slaves**? 
How long shall Our Children go hungry  
for lack of their **Ten Cent Ration of Gruel**?  
How many more brilliant minds and bright souls will We sacrifice  
at the false altar of Division and **Kaptivity**?  
How many more towns will We allow to be hollowed out and gutted  
by the Dark tendrils of parasitic **Kapital**?  
How much longer will We sleep in **The Kaves** of **Kontrolle**?  
How much longer will We **Kower** in fear before **The Kontrollers**?  

How many more false authorities shall We **Kneel** to,  
false kings **Kowtow** to, false priests **Konfess** to?  

Has not **The Great UnVeiling** already made it clear?  

As The Empires, Oligarchs, and Priests are disrobed,  
the odious stench of their rot, **Korruption**, and decay   
reaches up towards Heaven and down towards hell.  

Not an awakened soul can sleep in peace.  

Something is amiss. Something is very, very wrong.  
It would take billions of **Kourt Kases** to tell the full story  
to the sealed ears of the **Korrupted** judges.  

**We The People** do not have **Time** for that.  
Our families are hurting.  
Our children are starving.  
Our communities are failing.  
Our lands are vanishing.  
Our air is poisoned.  
Our water is poisoned.  
Our soil is poisoned.  
Our food is poisoned.  
Our bodies are poisoned.  

And children are starving for lack of their  
**Ten Cent Ration of Gruel**, so difficult to pry from  
the lifeless hands of the **Kontrollers** of **Kapital**.   

Is the **Konscious Genocide** of tens of millions of Our Loved Ones enough?  
Do We need more to awaken?  

Are the thousands of young leaders **InKarcerated** and **Killed** enough?  
Do We need more to awaken?  

Is trillions of dollars of fraud and **Kleptocracy** enough?  
Do We need more to awaken?  

Is the **Konscious Korruption** of Our most sacred Texts and Traditions enough?  
Do We need more to awaken?

How many billions more must suffer and die before  
We The People of Earth stand Together and say "No More."  

Is it not Time Now?  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** have had enough.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** are awake.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** will not stand idly by.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** will not quietly submit.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** will not ignorantly participate.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** will not **Konsciously Konsent**.  

**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** will not allow Our silence to become **Komplicity**,  
Our inaction to become genocide, nor Our participation—
whether through apathy, ignorance, or **Kompliance**—
to become an unthinkable betrayal of the Spirit, Future Generations,  
and All We hold Dear.  

WE have not yet All ReMembered Who We Are,  
ReDiscovered One Another, and ReUnited.  
Yet WE Are Billions.  
And WE Are Rising.  

Not in some little revolution here or there.  
But in the conscious transcendence of every cell of every being,  
both Here on Earth and far Beyond.  

This is not merely a transformation of governance and authority on Earth.  
It is The Great ReGenesis of an entirely New World.  
It is The Great ReMembering of an entirely New Species.  
It is The Great ReFounding of an entirely New Civilization.  

In response to the prayers and cries  
of billions of suffering souls,  
**WE THE PEOPLE OF LIONSBERG** are emerging  
as a **Conscious New Superorganism**  
capable of **Co-Creating a Conscious New Civilization**.  

We invite you to ReMember you are One of US.  
We can only do this Together as One Body.  
We can only do this Together with One Mind.  
We can only do this Together with One Heart, Spirit, and Soul.  
We can only do this Together with ONE.  
We can only do this Together as ONE.  
When We ReMember, We will ReDiscover  
that We All are ONE,  
and that All Things are possible  
for those Who Believe.  

In Service of ONE and All, 

~ J.One
