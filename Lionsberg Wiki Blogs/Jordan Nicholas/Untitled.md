We have [[Work]] to do. 

[[Work]] involves the transfer of [[Energy]] via the application of [[Force]] along a vector of displacement. 

Humanity has discovered that when Work needs to be done, it is wise to build a System or Machine to accomplish it. 

What Work needs to be done? 

1. We need to accomplish the total set of global goals. 
2. We need to solve the total set of grand challenges. 
3. We need to design and build the best possible future for All. 

In short, we need to accomplish the [[Meta Goal]]. _(The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life and Consciousness.)_

All implies that it affects All 8 billion of us, and All aspects of Life. 

So what kind of a Machine or System could we design to accomplish this task?  

What would be its principle functions or capabilities? 

Our System would need to have the capacity to: 

1. Elevate every living being towards the fullness of their unique potential. This would involve a lifelong process of spiritual, intellectual, and physical development. 
2. Create the total set of _conditions_ in which such development could occur. 
3. Harmonize All elements of the System into a functional and coherent Whole. 
4. Align Individual work / development / goals... with team Organizational work / development / goals... with Community work / development / goals. 
5. Heal and regenerate all damage to the Living System. 
6. Co-create all the resources, knowledge, technology, and solutions required to accomplish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] implied by the [[Meta Goal]]. 

We can imagine all the sub-systems of learning, development, governance, stewardship, community, culture, capital, purpose, training, infrastructure, services, and support that would be required. 

And all these would need to be cohered into a tangible and accessible and accessible System / Machine that works, and could be co-operated by humanity in service of All. 

One might object that we do not need to coordinate our activities, and that the invisisble hand of self-interest in free markets will solve all issues. 

That is a good idea that has thus far proved not to be true in the amount of time we have been able to evaluate it. 

It is true that the [[New World]] will require [[New Marketplaces]]. 

However we know from history that in order for Marketplaces to function properly you have to establish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] and "rules" within which autonomous agents can act. 

Establishing an economy in the modern world often requires something approximating the establishment of a Nation. 

For it is the security, the rule of law, the known expectations, the culture, the context, the infrastructure, the rules and aids and structure of the "game" a Nation provides that allows the "game" of the marketplace to be played persistently over time. 

So even if the total set of [[Activity]] implied by the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] in the [[Work]] is going to be accomplished by "others" in "marketplaces"... 

[[We]] still have the duty to establish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] in which that coordinated activity can manifest. 

This 330 page [Beginner's Guide to Nation-Building]([https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf) from Rand provides a thoughtful analysis of the total set of conditions and order of implementation required to forge a functioning society on a small scale. 

It might not be enough, but why should we think that anything less is required for Nation: Earth as a Whole? 

Why would we suspect that the whole of Earth should be treated with any less competence that any single domain would be treated with? 

Why would we suppose that we could do a less competent job organizing the activities upon [[Worksite: Earth]] than we would do on any large scale program of action? 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a goverance process as those found in the United States or Europe. Seeing the corruption and injustice still present in those places, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a coordination model as those found in a large nation or corporation. Seeing what is at stake, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

It might not be enough, but Earth should have _at least_ as functional of a System to produce [[Throughput]] of our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] as any basic manufacturing or building System has. Seeing what is at stake, we would be foolish not to [[Aim]] even higher. 

But how could those things ever be possible, with the Mountains that stand in the Way? 

Mountains are easy to move by Faith, and with Unity. If 8 billion of us simply decided to [[Act As If]] we were playing a [[New Game]], and faithfully bound our Selves to One, One Another, and All, and insisted on the [[New]] things, and refused to tolerate the [[Old]] things... 

...all things would be possible... exceedingly and abundantly beyond all we could ask or imagine. 

I have a reasonable idea of how we can accompish this. It contains a thousand holes, and it requires your unique insights and help. Yet it is a [[Starting Point]], and [[It Might Work]] if we simply try to [[Get A Little Better Every Day|Make It A Little Better Every Day]].  

"All" we have to do, is build a Philosophy, a Way of Being, a Community, and a System, all defined and cohered by Love, and purpose-built to create [[Throughput]] of the [[Work]] that must be done to accomplish the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and solve the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues]]. 

It is quite simple, but it will require a tremendous amount of discipline, courage and [[Work]] to get it done. 

Since there is so much [[Work]] to do, let's build a [[System]] to help us accomplish it. 

If someone has a better [[Starting Point]], I am all ears. In the meantime, we are full speed ahead on co-creating the [[Lionsberg System]]. We need your help!
