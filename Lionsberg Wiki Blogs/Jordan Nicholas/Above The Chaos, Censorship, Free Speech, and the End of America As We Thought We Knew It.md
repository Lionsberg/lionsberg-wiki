# Above The Chaos, Censorship, Free Speech, and the End of America As We Thought We Knew It

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.02.18 _(updated 2024.02.18)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

Greetings friends and allies, 

Tucker Carlson recently interviewed Mike Benz in what Robert F. Kennedy called "one of the most remarkable interviews ever: How the Pentagon and CIA created a Censorship Industrial Complex to fix US elections."

It is worth watching, and us working together to understand. 
 
[Tucker Carlson X Brian Benz Interview](https://x.com/tuckercarlson/status/1758529993280205039?s=46&t=6Tqe5bY9704fmywTF-3e6A)    

For the last couple years, I have been arguing that 2024 is likely to be the last quasi-democratic election in US history. If we do not sort this out NOW, the American Experiment we thought we were living in is over. 

Because of the degree of abject and permeating corruption and deceit in the [[Invisible Power Structures]] puppeting the [[Visible Power Structures]], only a radical 
response at the constitutional level has any chance of succeeding in curing the cancer that is destroying the United States, the European Union, Western Civilization, and therefore the world. 

As reiterated in [[Above The Chaos, Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto|Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto]], I believe this requires 70% of Americans getting behind a constitutional amendment to fundamentally reset the American Experiment, shrink the federal government by at least 80%, decentralize and redistribute power and authority back to states and localities, and make the US among the first nations to enact and embody the New Covenant.

I cannot repeat this enough... the existing Order is failing, and no family on Earth is safe. 

I took the time to take notes on the podcast to begin mapping the issues discussed for action since they are very near to the root cause of the [[Meta Crisis]]. 

I pray you find it useful, and that together we can build on it to move beyond basic awareness into coordinated plans of action.

## Jordan's Notes From The Mike Bencz Interview 

### Foundational Rights

- [[Freedom of Conscience]]  
- [[Freedom of Speech]]  
	- No exceptions for hate speech, misinformation, or disinformation 
	- Which in the end end up being defined by the Power Structures 
- There is very little difference between [[Freedom of Speech]] and [[Freedom of Thought]]   
	- Many humans do not engage in Meta Cognition, and do not know what they think until they speak  
- Freedom of Thought / Conscience / Speech is a foundational right from which many or all other rights flow  

### The New Military Industrial Censorship 

- This is a new form of [[Censorship]] unlike anything previously encountered  
	- affected on the basis of fights against disinformation, misinformation, malinformation 
	- Dis/Mis/Mal Information does not exist in reference to whether it is true
	- you can speak something that is factually accurate to the best of your understanding, and in accordance with your own conscience, 
	- and because they are inconvenient to the power structures, you can be stripped of your right to express them... in person... online... 
	- and can even become a criminal act.
- These efforts are being directed by the US Government, the military industrial complex, and its proxies as directed by the [[Invisible Power Structures]]  
- We know this is happening intuitively... but what are the mechanics of how it happens? 
- Mike Benz is one of the world's experts and has been mapping this  
- Censorship from Military Industrial Complex 

### Internet Free Speech as an Instrument of Statecraft 

- Internet freedom and free speech 
- ...Developed and accentuated as an instrument of American statecraft 
- ...from the outset of privitization of internet in 1991
- DOD and State Department 
	- discovered that people were using the internet to congregate on forums  
	- The (CIA-cutout-NGO-blob architecture) 
	- Repeatedly helped dissident groups overthrow foreign governments 
- Many US Tech companies were conceived with close ties to the Military Industrial Complex 
	- Google, for example, began as a DARPA grant... 
		- funding from joint CIA and NSA program to chart how "birds of a feather flock together" online through search engine aggregation 
		- One year later, launched as Google
		- Began working as a military contractor soon after 
		- Got Google Maps by purchasing essentially a CIA satellite software  
- Ability of US Government to leverage "free speech on internet"... 
	- to circumvent state control over media in foreign countries 
	- To do what used to be done out of CIA Station Houses, Embassies, or Consulates 
	- In a way that was turbocharged 
- The array of "Internet free speech technology" was initially created by our national security state 
	- VPN - virtual private networks - to hide IP Address 
	- Tour? - the dark web - to be able to buy and sell anonymously 
	- end to end encrypted chats 
	- all created initially as DARPA projects or joint CIA NSA projects 
	- to help US intelligence backed groups overthrow foreign governments
	- who were causing problems to (Clinton / Bush / Obama administrations) 
- Free speech as an instrument of statecraft worked from 1991 to 2014... 
	- when there began to be a shift on free speech 
	- High water mark for free-speech-as-statecraft was Arab Spring 
	- 2011 2012 
	- one by one, all the adversary governments of Obama administration began to be toppled in facebook and twitter revolutions 
	- state department - worked closely with social media companies - to keep platforms online during those periods 
	- internet free speech - was an instrument of statecraft from national security state to begin... 
	- Architecture of NGOs, relationship of tech companies and national security state 

### The 2014 Post-Ukraine Coup Creation of NATO Hybrid Warfare and Censorship Capabilities 

- In 2014 after the US-sponsored coup in Ukraine... 
	- There was an unexpected counter-coup 
		- where Crimea and Donbas broke away with a military backstop that NATO was unprepared for 
	- Crimea annexation vote 2014 
		- when Crimea voted to join Russian Federation, 
		- was the last straw for online free speech in eyes of NATO 
	- Until 2014 - internet free speech had titled global affairs in favor of the National Security State / Blob... 
- NATO - perceived a shift in the fundamental nature of war   
	- NATO declared what they first called Gerasimov doctrine 
	- Russian general they claimed said... 
		- Don't need to military skirmishes to take over central and eastern Europe - just need to control media and social media - which controls elections
		- if you get the right admin into power - they control the military 
		- infinitely cheaper to conduct organized political influence operation over social and legacy media 
- An Industry Complex was then created 
	- spanning Pentagon, British ministry of defense, and Brussels, into an organized political warfare outfit... 
	- to create psychological buffer zones 
	- to censor Russian progaganda 
	- or domestic right wing populist groups 
		- rising in Europe because of migrant crisis 
		- advocating for ongoing use of Russian energy  
		- at a time US / NATO trying to stop Nord Stream / Russian energy projects 
	- Germany's AFD - Alternative For Deutschland 
	- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
- Then came Brexit June 2016 
	- crisis moment where not just central and eastern Europe threatened 
	- but (it) was now coming westward 
	- fear of Russian control over hearts and minds
- Warsaw Conference July 2016 - one month later  
	- NATO Amended its charter 
		- to expressly commit to hybrid warfare as new NATO capacity 
		- From 70 years of tanks and conventional psychological operations... 
		- ... to a new capacity to monitor and censor social media 
		- ...and internet free speech 
		- if it was deemed to be (subversive) 

### The Perceived Threat of Domestic Populism 

- Simultaneously, NATO publishing white papers saying that biggest threat 
- ... was not just Russia, but losing elections across Europe... 
- ...to right wing populist groups... working class movements... campaigning on cheap Russian energy... 
	- Made argument post-brexit, that the World Order would collapse unless military took control over media... 
	- ...because brexit would give rise to 
		- Frexit - Marine Le Pen 
		- Spexit - Vox party 
		- Italy 
		- Germany 
		- Greece 
		- leading to the EU coming apart 
		- leading to NATO coming apart  
		- leading to no enforcement arm for IMF and World Bank 
			- Leaving the financial stakeholders who depend on national security state - helpless against governments around the world. 
- This was a fundamental shift from fear of Russia... 
	- ...to fear that citizens of their own countries would get their way
	- ...and turning warfare capabilities internally against citizen groups  

### Inception of National Security State 

- Cold war - was a struggle for the hearts and minds of the people of Eastern Europe 
	- Information and psychological warfare 
	- Psychological Buffer zones 
- Prior to that... 
- Post WWII
	- New world order 
	- New international institutions 
	- 1948 - national security state established  
	- 1947 act that established CIA 
	- 1948 declaration of human rights that prohibited the territorial acquisition by military force - 
		- could no longer run military occupation government - 
		- everything had to be done by some kind of political legitimization process... 
		- some kind of ratification by hearts and minds of the people within the country... 
		- often via puppet politicians groomed as emerging leaders by our State Department 
- George Kennon? 
	- 12 days after the United States rigged the Italian election by working with the mob 
	- Published memo - The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare 
	- We at CIA just rigged Italian election... we had to do it... it works... 
	- We need a department to do this around the world 
	- new social contract with American people 
- 1948 - Rename War Department to Defense Department 
	- Part of diplomatic onslaught for making (foreign activities) look like political control rather than overt military control 
- The new social contract predicated on creating a foreign / domestic firewall 
	- Officially establishing a department of dirt tricks to 
		- rig foreign elections 
		- control foreign media 
		- mettle in internal affairs of every other place in world 
		- but explicitly not allowed to operate here in US - State Department, Defense Department, CIA expressly forbidden to operate on US Soil 
	- This ended up being laughably far from the case... 

### The Accelerating Shift of Censorship and Psychological Operations from Foreign to Domestic 

- The intentional creation of censorship and psychological operations 
	- was apparently morally justified 
	- because it operated outside of the US... 
	- started in Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, Finland 
- The Shift
	- The tide began shifting post-Crimea counter-coup in 2014... 
	- Diplomatic debate accelerating post-Brexit 
	- Then ramping up to full throttle when Trump wins the 2016 election  
- The National Security State 
	- ...began explicitly laundering tricks developed over 70 years of meddling in foreign elections and foreign affairs 
	- ...into the creation of censorship industry... 
	- Aimed at the internet and social media
	- ...*Domestically* 
- What little moral and political resistance arose
	- was washed over by rise of Russiagate - which allowed them to not have to deal with moral ambiguities of censoring your own people... 
	- if Trump was Russian asset - no longer a free speech issue, but national security issue 
- The Foreign to Domestic Switch 
	- After Russiagate died in July 2019 - when Robert Muller revealed he had nothing after 2.5 years of investigation 
	- The foreign to domestic switch took place 
	- Took censorship architecture spanning DHS, FBI, CIA, DOD, DOJ, and thousands of government-funded NGO and private sector mercenary firms
	- All transited from foreign predicate (Russia), to a Democracy predicate... 
		- by saying that disinformation 
		- was not just a threat when it comes from the Russians
		- ...but was an intrinsic threat to democracy itself. 
	- By that the National Security (blob) was able to launder the democracy promotion / regime change tool kit
		- just in time for 2020 election 

### Security State Interference in US Elections 

- While it was well known that the military industrial complex had been manipulating politics via money, lobbying, and influence for decades... 
- ...the idea that tools from information war against Soviet Union and Russia 
- ...could be consciously turned against US citizens by the US government was unthinkable to many in the US. 
- The US Government - may have turned its capabilities inward... to rig elections in the United States... as it had in other countries in the past 
- The Democracy predicate 
	- The United States developed... 
	- ...a professional class of regime change artists and operatives 
	- ...to otherthrow governments and "preserve democracy" around the world  
	- if the democracy threat is now deemed to be home grown  
	- suddenly - all these people have new jobs moving on US soil

### The Internet Crisis for Military / State Department / Intelligence 

- NATO / the blob - were not ready for the rapid rise of internet influence 
	- 2016 - first time social media had reached such maturity it began to eclipse legacy media in terms of influence 
	- From 2006 to 2016 - building 
	- Internet 1.0 1991 to 2004 - there was no social media 
	- 2004 facebook
	- 2005 twitter 
	- 2006 youtube 
	- 2007 smart phone 
	- in initial internet period, no one online was getting followers at level they competed with legacy news media... 
	- Even dissident voices never reaching millions of followers, billions of impressions 
	- As citizen journalists and independent voices began to outcompete legacy media... 
	- this induced a massive crisis in military, state department, and intelligence services 
- Example - 2019 - meeting of German Marshall Fund - 
	- institution that goes back to US bribe / soft power projection in Europe as part of reconstruction of European governments after WWII 
	- ...to be able to pay them with Marshall fund dollars, in turn have them under our thumb for how they reconstructed... 
	- meeting in 2019 where 4 star general asks on panel: 
		- what happens to US military / national security state where New York Times is reduced to medium sized facebook page? 
	- We have (historically) had these gate keepers 
	- century old relationship with legacy media 
	- from outset, US media was not independent from national security state... 
		- initial broadcast news companies... 
		- ...NBC, ABC, and CBS...
		- all created by Office of War Information veterans from the War Department's effort in WWII
	- Operation Mockingbird relationships from 1950s to 1970s
	- Those continued through use of National Endowment for Democracy 
	- and privatization of intelligence capacities in 1980s under Reagan
	- All sorts of CIA reading room memos about continued media relations throughout the 1990s
	- There has always been a backdoor relationship between Washington Post, New York Times, all the major broadcast media corporations, Rupert Murdoch - 
	- National Endowment for Democracy Coalition
		- Formed in 1983 as a way to do CIA operations in an above board way 
		- After the democrats were so ticked off at CIA - for manipulating student movements in 1970s 
	- By the 2010s, there was no CIA intermediary or Pentagon backstop to random citizen journalist accounts 
		- Couldn't get a story killed 
		- Couldn't have a favors for favors relationship 
		- Couldn't stop information spreading from a citizen with an opinion on Syrian gas
	- From 2006 to 2014, not a problem, because no dissident groups with a mature enough ecosystem on their own 
	- All the victories on social media had gone where the money was... 
		- State Department 
		- Defense Department 
		- Intelligence Services 
- Then - as social media and internet maturity happened - after 2016 election - 
	- now a fear arises that the entire International Order might come undone...
	- ...70 years of unified foreign policy from Truman to Trump now about to be broken 

### Reestablishing Deep State Control 

- (Deep State) says - we need the same analog control systems we had to control legacy media... 
	- we now need to establish and consolidate in social media companies 
	- initially Russiagate provided a predicate 
	- after that was proved to be illegitimate
	- ...switched to a simple Democracy predicate 
	- giving rise to a multi-billion dollar censorship industry... 
	- that joins together 
		- military industrial complex, 
		- the government 
		- the private sector 
		- civil society organizations 
		- and the vast cobweb of media allies, professional fact checker groups... 
	- ...that serve as sentinel class and surveil everything on internet 

### Example: Global Engagement Center

- As one example of How national security state lies to the population and censors the truth 
- There is a State Department outfit called - Global Engagement Center 
	- First government censorship operation... within federal government... but foreign facing at the time of its establishment so at the time deemed ok... 
	- used the homegrown ISIS threat as a predicate 
	- leading to need for State Department to have formal coordination relationship with every major tech platform in the US... because idea was that terrorists were recruiting on there... 
	- Global Engagement Center was established to be state department entanglement / control with social media
	- Created by - Rick Stengel 
	- Who described himself as Obama's propagandist in chief 
	- who made public arguments against first amendments and free speech 
		- argument - that constitution was not prepared for internet 
		- need to get rid of first amendment accordingly 
	- Undersecretary for Public Affairs - liaison office between State Department and media - where government talking points about war, statecraft, foreign policy synchronized with mainstream media 
	- The Global Engagement Center...
	- ...Created new technology - natural language processing... AI / machine learning ability to create meaning out of words... 
		- in order to map everything everyone says on the internet
		- and create vast topography of how communities are organized online 
		- who the major influencers are
		- what they are talking about 
		- what narratives are emerging
		- what narratives are tending 
		- to create a network graph 
		- to know how information moves through an ecosystem 
		- to know who to target 
	- Began plotting the language - prefixes, suffixes, popular terms, slogans, that ISIS operatives were using... 
	- That would subsequently be used against citizens in the United States and Europe

### State Department Shifts in 2016 - Europe and the Atlantic Council 

- When Trump won in 2016 - everyone in State Department expecting promotions under Hillary, who ran state department under Obama... 
	- Were fired by Trump - who New York Times said on the day of elections was a 20:1 underdog 
	- (former) State department diplomats took skills in coercing governments... international roadshow... 
		- ...to pressure European governments... 
		- ...to pass censorship laws... 
		- ...to censor right wing populist groups in Europe... 
- People moving from State Department to Atlantic Council 
	- Which was major facilitator of government to government censorship operations 
	- Group that was one of Biden's biggest political backers 
	- They bill themselves as NATO's think tank 
		- Representing political consensus of NATO 
	- When NATO has civil society actions they want to be coordinated to synchronize with military action in a region, 
		- ...Atlantic Council deployed to consensus build and make that political action happen in a region
	- Atlantic Council has 7 former CIA directors on its board 
		- Heavyweight in censorship industry 
			- annual funding from 
				- DOD
				- state department 
				- CIA cutouts like National Endowment for Democracy 
	- In January 2017 Atlantic Council moves to pressure European governments to 
		- pass censorship laws 
		- to create transatlantic attack on free speech 
		- In the way Rick Stengel called for 
		- to have the US mimic European censorship laws 
	- One way - by getting Germany to pass NetzDG in August 2017 
		- which kicked off the era of automated censorship in the United States 
		- Unless US tech companies wanted to pay a $54 Million fine for each instance of speech, each post left up on platform for more than 48 hours... 
		- Identified as hate speech...
		- (which would cause them to be fined into bankruptcy)... 
		- safe haven around that... 
		- was deploying AI based censorship technologies... 
		- created by DARPA... 
		- to take on ISIS... to scan and ban speech automatically... 
		- Weapons of mass deletion 
		- ability to censor millions of posts with code 

### The Field of Censorship Science

- The field of censorship science - fuses together... 
	- poltical and social scientists - who are the thought leaders of what should be censored
	- the quants / programmers / computational data scientists and linguistics 
	- over 60 universities who get federal government grants 
		- to do the censorship preparation work 
		- and the censorship work 
		- by creating code books 
		- of the language that people use 
		- the same way they did for ISIS

### Example: Covid Censorship 

- For instance: 
	- Covid lexicons... of what narratives were emerging 
	- about mandates, masks, vaccines, etc. 
	- about high profile individuals whose reputations needed to be protected online
	- created code books 
	- broke things down into narratives 
	- Atlantic Council was part of the government funded consortium called the Virality Project 
		- mapped 66 different narratives 
		- broken down into factual subclaims 
		- plugged into machine learning models 
		- to have a world heat map of what was being said about covid
		- whenever something started to trend that was bad for what the Pentagon / power structures wanted, 
		- they were able to take down 10s of millions of posts. 

### Example: 2020 Election

- They did the same thing in 2020 election with mail in ballots 
	- The Pentagon - censored Americans during 2020 election 
	- The two most censored events in US history - 2020 election, and covid 19 pandemic 
- 2020 Election 
	- determined by mail in ballots 
	- censorship issue was extraordinary 
	- plot within department of homeland of security.
	- grouped with Atlantic Council and foreign policy establishment 
	- Arguing in 2017 for the need for a permanent domestic censorship government office 
		- to serve as quarterback for a whole of society counter misinformation counter disinformation alliance (censorship) 
		- Counter mis/disinfo
		- We need every asset, mobilized in a whole of society effort, to stop mis/dis/info online... 
		- ...because it is an existential threat to democracy 
	- In 2017 - determined that it needed to be centered in the government, 
		- which was the only place that would have the clout, coercive threat powers, and perceived authority to be able to tell the social media companies what to do... 
		- ...to summon a government funded NGO swarm to create the media surround sound... 
		- ...to arm an army of fact checkers... 
		- ...and connect all these censorship industry actors into a unified whole 
	- Atlantic Council proposed - initiative called Forward Defense - 
		- Contemplated parking at State Department's Global Engagement Center... 
			- ...but no national security predicate, and supposed to be foreign facing
		- then CIA... 
			- ...also supposed to be foreign facing... 
		- And they also need 10s of thousands of people involved... 
			- ...in a whole society model... 
		- FBI - supposed to be intelligence arm of Justice Department... 
			- but not criminal issues... 
		- Only other domestic intelligence equity is the DHS... 
	- so they decided take CIAs power to rig and bribe foreign media organizations 
		- and combine it with the domestic jurisdiction of FBI 
		- by putting it at DHS
	- The DHS was empowered through obscure cyber security agency... 
		- CISA - Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency 
		- Created by act of congress in 2018 - 
			- because of perceived threat that Russia had hacked the 2016 election physically 
			- so we needed the cyber security power to deal with that. 
		- January 6 2017... CIA memo.. and DHS executive order... 
			- arguing that Russia had interfered in 2016 election 
			- and DHS mandate saying elections are now critical infrastructure 
		- Now a new power in DHS - 
			- to say that cyber security attacks on elections are within their purview 
	- To gain authority, they then said that:  
		- Mis/Dis/Mal information online are a form of cyber attack because they are happening online 
			- Russian disinformation - don't need Russian predicate
			- so therefore... 
			- your tweets as a US Citizen
				- about mail in ballots - if you tweet and undermine public faith
				- you are conducting a cyber attack on critical US Infrastructure 
				- by articulating misinformation on Twitter 
				- which is in the cyberrealm 
			- misinformation is a cyber attack on democracy 
			- when it undermines public faith and confidence 
			- in our democratic elections and institutions 
		- then defining democratic institutions 
			- as another thing that was a cyber security attack to undermine... 
				- and later, mainstream media considered a democratic institution 
	- In advance of 2020 elections, starting in April but going back before... 
		- you had a never-Trump neocon DHS 
			- working with NATO on national security side 
			- and Democratic National Convention 
			- to use Department of Homeland Security 
			- for a government coordinated mass censorship campaign spanning every social media platform 
				- in order to pre-censor the ability to dispute the legitimacy of mail in ballots 
		- This was done by aggregating 4 institutions:  
			- Stanford University  
			- University of Washington  
			-  Graphika (a company)  
			- Atlantic Council  
		- All 4 - had centers within them, essentially serving as Pentagon cutouts
			- Stanford Internet Observatory - run by former US Ambassador to Russia - Michael McFall?  
				- Who personally authored a 7 step playbook for how to orchestrate a color revolution  
				- involving maintaining total control over media and social media  
				- juicing up civil society outfits  
				- calling elections illegitimate  
				- all professional election de-legitimizers in 2016  
				- Alex Stamos - another liason  
				- Renee Duresta? started career in CIA and wrote intelligence report on Russian disinformation 
			- University of Washington 
				- Bill Gates 
				- Kate Starboard - 3 generations of military brass 
				- crisis infomatics ... social media surveillance for pentagon 
			- Graphika 
				- $7M in Pentagon grants 
				- got start as part of Pentagons Minerva initiative -
					- psychological warfare research center of Pentagon 
				- social media spying and narrative mapping until 2016 election 
				- then repurposed to censor 22 million pro trump tweets about mail in ballots 
			- Atlantic council 
				- 7 CIA directors on board 
			- What Ben Rhodes described as the blob during Obama administration 
				- foreign policy establishment
				- DOD
				- state department
				- CIA
			- threatened by Trump's foreign policy 
	- The head of election integrity partnership - said on tape - that they were set up to do what the government was banned from doing itself 
		- and articulated a multi-step framework to cooerce the tech companies to take censorship actions 
			- that the tech companies would not have done but for their pressure 
		- involved using threats of government force... 
			- because they were the deputized arm of the government... 
			- formal partnership with DHS
		- able to use DHS proprietary domestic disinformation switchboard 
			- to immediately talk to top brass at all tech companies for takedowns 
		- bragging on tape about getting the tech cos to all systematically adopt 
			- a new terms of service 
				- speech violation band called delegitimization 
				- which meant any post / video / etc... that undermined public faith and confidence in use of (mail in ballots or early voting drop boxes)... or ballot tabulation issues on election day
				- was prima facia term of service violation... 
			- that they only adopted from government pressure... from the Election Integrity Partnership 
		- including grid they used to do it
		- simultaneously invoking threats of government 
			- breaking them up
			- stopping doing favors 
		- and inducing crisis PR working with media allies. 
		- Said that government / DHS could not do this themselves, so they set this up 
			- Constellation of state department, pentagon, and I.C. networks to run this pre-censorship campaign 
				- Which by their own math had 22 million tweets on twitter alone  
				- And did it on 15 platforms, 100s of millions of posts
				- scanned and banned, or throttled, or had frictions affixed to them  
		- Did this 7 months months before the election... because concerned about the perceived legitimacy of a Biden victory 
			- Knew that Biden could only win through disproportionate Democrat use of mail in ballots 
			- Knew there was going to be a crisis if it looked like Trump won, 
			- then later comes out based on mail in ballot tabulation that Biden won 
		- National security state said public won't be ready 
			- so in advance we need to pre-censor the ability to even question the legitimacy 
			- Right on the heels of the pentagon and CIA led impeachment of Trump, led by   
				- Eric Ciaramella from CIA 
				- the Vindmans from the Pentagon 
				- over alleged phone call regarding withholding Ukraine aid 
			- This is the same network 
				- which came out of the Pentagon hybrid warfare military censorship network 
					- created after the first Ukraine crisis in 2014 
						- who were lead architects of Trump's Ukraine impeachment in 2019
						- and then 2020 election censorship operation
		- DHS had federalized much of the national election administration through the January 6, 2017 executive order from outgoing Obama DHS head Jeh Johnson 
			- Which wrapped all 50 states up into a formal DHS partnership 
			- DHS simultaneously responsible for administration of the election in many respects 
				- and the censorship of anyone who challenged the administration of the election 

### From Democracy to Deep State Military Rule 

- What I am essentially describing is military rule 
	- The rise of censorship industry is a total inversion of the idea of democracy itself 
		- Democracy draws its legitimacy by rule from consent 
				- The government is our will expressed by our consent 
- After Elections that did not go the way the deep state wanted: 
	- 2014 Ukraine 
	- 2016 US
	- 2016 Phillipines election 
	- Deep state moves to Invert the underpinnings of democratic society...   
		- to deal with the threat of free speech on the internet 
	- By Saying... 
		- we need to redefine democracy from being about the will of the voters... 
			- to being about the sanctity of democratic institutions 
				- who are - the military, NATO, IMF, World Bank, mainstream media, NGOs (largely state department or IC funded) - the elite establishments that were under threat from the rise of domestic populism 
					- that declared their own consensus to be the new definition of democracy 
		- if you define Democracy to be the strength of democratic institutions... 
			- rather than the will of voters... 
					- then democracy is just the consensus building architecture within the self-proclaimed institutions themselves 
- Atlantic Council - proxy for NATO 
	- coordination for: 
		- oil and gas industry in a region 
		- finance / JP Morgans and Blackrocks
		- NGOs in the region 
		- media in the region 
	- takes a lot of time / work / negotiation 
		- to get NGOs to agree with Blackrock to agree with military to agree with oil and gas, and Wall Street Journal, and community and activist groups who are onboarded with respect to a particular initiative 
				- that is the vote building process from their perspective 
	- If at the end of the day citizen or populist groups decide they like a commoner 
			- more than carefully constructed consensus of the NATO military brass 
				- from their perspective that is now an attack on democracy 
- Democracy has the magic regime change predicate 
	- where democracy is our magic watch word to be able to overthrow governments from the ground up 
		- in a sort of color revolution style 
			- whole of society effort to topple a democratically elected government from the inside, 
				- for example like we did with Ukraine 
	- Taking that special set of skills home, now perhaps here to stay 
		- fundamentally changes the nature of American government 
			- because of the threat of one small voice - becoming popular on social media 
- For Example: 
	- In 2021 
	- And 2024
	- NSA broke into Tucker Carlson's apps
	- and leaked them to media... 

### The Function of Interstitial NGOs and Think Tanks

- The function of the interstitial government funded non-governmental organizations and think tanks 
- For Example: The Aspen Institute and Hunter Biden Laptop Story 
	- Lion share of funding from state department 
	- FBI had advance knowledge of pending publication of Hunter Biden laptop story 
		- then the Aspen Institute, which is run by former CIA and NSA and FBI and Civil Society orgs... 
			- End up with the same information...
				- holds a mass stakeholder censorship simulation - 3 day conference 
					- Yoel Roth was there... Twitter file leaks... 
		- Aspen Institute - which is an addendum of national security state - 
			- got the same information that the national security state spied on journalists and political figures to obtain 
				- and not only leaked it... 
					- but did a joint coordinated censorship simulator in September 2 months before election 
						- just like censorship of mail in ballots 
							- to be ready to pre-censor anyone amplifying a new story that they and the FBI knew about, that hadn't broken yet. 
- Aspen Institute 
	- Former President of CNN ran it, 
	- Walter Isaacson... 
		- series of interviews with Rick Stengel specifically on issue - of the need to get rid of the first amendment 
		- and the threat that free speech on the internet poses to democracy 
- Very few in the country had any idea... 
	- Much of that not to public light until last year... 
		- Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter 
		- Twitter Files 
		- Republican turnover in House that led to investigation 
		- Lawsuits like Missouri vs. Biden and discover process there... 
- Disinformation Governance Board 
	- Head of that Nina Jankowicz got here start in censorship industry 
		- from same clandestine intelligence community censorship network 
			- created after the 2014 Crimea situation 
		- Her name came up 5 years earlier as part of UK inner cluster cell of a busted clandestine operation to censor the internet called the Integrity Initiative 
			- Which was created by the UK Foreign Office 
			- and backed by NATOs Political Affairs unit
		- in order to carry out... 
			- the NATO psychological innoculation, 
			- ability to kill Russian propaganda, 
			- or rising political groups who wanted to maintain energy relations with Russia
				- At time US was trying to kill the Nordstream and other pipeline operations 
	- After Nina went down, it was Michael Chertoff, who was running the Aspen Institute Cyber group 
		- Aspen Institute censorship simulator for Hunter Biden laptop story
		- Two years later Chertoff head of Disinformation Governance Board after Nina forced to step down 
		- Chertoff was chairman at BAE 
			- the largest military contractor in Europe BAE Military 
	-It is all connected  

### Internet Free Speech, X, and the Election Year

- At the beginning of election year 
	- a couple wars unfolding simultaneously 
- X is considered by some as most free platform post-Elon acquisition
	- under extraordinary pressure - 
		- that will continue to mount as election approaches 
- Elon has unique buffer with national security state - which is quite reliant on Elon properties 
	- Green Revolution - Battery Tech 
	- SpaceX - pioneering and saturating presence in low earth satellites, starlink 
	- If national security state goes too hard - 
		- For instance by invoking something like CIFIUS to nationalize  some of these properties... 
		- shockwave would be irrecoverable... 
	- Deep State seems to be trying to induce regime change - 
		- 7 or 8 different justice department, SEC, or FTC investigations into Elon properties that all started after acquisition of X  
		- Various legacy media pieces 
- Concern - the Transatlantic flank attack version 2.0 
	- The first transatlantic attack was around sanctions 
	- This time, the roadshow is for censorship 
	- Missouri v. Biden - handicaps deep state censorship efforts...
- Strategy 1: State level censorship laws 
		- California just passed a new law - Platform Accountability and Transparency - 
			- forcing Elon to give over the kind of narrative mapping data they were using... 
- Strategy 2: Europe - EU Digital Services act - 
	- cooked up with Newsguard
		- board of Michael Hayden (NSA), 
		- Rick Stengel (State Department Propaganda office), 
		- Tom Ridge (DHS), 
		- Ander Fogh Rasmussen (NATO) 
	- So NSA, State Department, DHS, NATO working with EU to craft censorship laws that are the largest threat to X 
	- Disinformation now banned as a matter of law in the EU 
	- EU is a bigger market for X than US 
	- X forced to comply with new law ratified this year 
		- Either forfeit 6% of annual revenue to maintain operations there 
		- or - put in place the kind of programs - to have have the internal mechanisms - to censor anything the EU (which is a proxy for NATO) - deems to be disinformation 
- with 65 elections around the globe this year... 
- Pressure is likely to be immense.
