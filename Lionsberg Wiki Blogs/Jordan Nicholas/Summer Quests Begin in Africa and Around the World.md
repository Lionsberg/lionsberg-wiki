# The Quests Begin—From East Africa to the Ends of the Earth
A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
**Summer Solstice 2025**   

Greetings from East Africa.

A few weeks ago, we were weaving threads of vision in a sanctuary  
in the mountains of Idaho when a cry pierced the stillness.

Food had run out.  

Our beloved children were going hungry.  
Our elders were collapsing under the unbearable weight  
of holding schools and communities together with no resources left to give.  

And then came the unforgettable words—

> _“Every woman who has given birth understands… every child is one of her children.”_

> _“We The People of LIONSBERG will not let children go hungry.”_

Voices cracked with exhaustion and broke with tears,  
but shone with the Light of something eternal and True.  

We knew, as many of you will know, exactly what we had to do.

## What Would You Do?

If you had one dollar in your pocket,  
and a child you loved was suffering for lack of a ten cent daily ration of gruel…  

Would you turn away?    
Would you scroll past?  
Would you assume it was somebody else's responsibility?  

Or would you answer the prayer?  

## The Divine Intention Is Clear

Deep within, we can all sense it.  
**Love.**  
If you Love, **Care.**  
If you Care, **Act.**  

Start with the least.  
Start with the most vulnerable.  
That is where The Kingdom begins.  

So, just as you would have, we acted.  
Small amounts of energy and resources began to move.  
And hundreds of lives were touched.  
Not by charity. But by kinship. By fellowship. By love.   
By remembering that any children are our children, and that  
there is no "them" "out there" to feed them when  
the pantries run dry.  
It is up to **Us who receive the call**.   

## The Story Unfolds

In recent years, we have been co-creating a new platform, a new pattern, and a new community—  
One that dares to believe **a better world is possible**, that it begins with **Us**, and that the time is **Now**.

We call it **LIONSBERG**.

It exists to empower people like you and me to collaborate to meet real needs  
and solve real problems together—immediately where we are—  
while working toward systemic and planetary transformation in the years ahead.

In 2024, we discovered what many had long suspected:  
We do not actually have a functioning system of democratic self-governance—  
Not in America.  
Not in the world.  

The structures are broken.  
The systems are failing.  
But **We The People** are not.  
And **We Are Rising**.  

And so **The Mission** now accelerates:  
The next milestone is to connect and empower  
**The First Three Percent** of humanity—  
those awake and willing to rise, to act, and to build—  
so that **Together**, we can usher in the next chapter of Earth’s story.

## The Summer Quests Have Begun

As we cross this threshold of the Solstice, I begin my **Summer Quest** in East Africa,  
walking shoulder to shoulder with beautiful, courageous souls doing everything they can  
to hold the line against hunger, poverty, tyranny, and injustice.  
**In this city this week**, youth are being shot and abducted by government forces,  
protests are escalating, and rumors of revolution abound.  
It will be an interesting next few weeks to say the least.  

At the same time, other Quests are beginning around the world—  
in towns, guilds, and cities across continents.  

Would you like to join us?

Would you like to **support**, to **participate**, or simply to **follow along**  
and witness the unfolding of something real, sacred, and good?

There is endless need.  
And infinite room in this Mission and Movement for every soul  
who Loves, Cares, and Dares to Act—in **Unity**.

gripping our communities, nations, and world.  
And every movement begins with a single choice,  
and a transformational first step.  

## A Glimpse From the Field

Since a video is worth ten thousand words, here is a short glimpse of some of the magic unfolding in East Africa.  

It’s rough. It was all filmed on cell phones.  
But it is real. And it is happening. Now.
