# Above The Chaos, Rediscovering God Beyond Religion

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

As I discuss the realignment of Society as One Under God, a strange question that strikes me every time it is asked is *Which God?* Like the playground question *Do you believe in God?*, these questions are so fundamentally broken, in such a broken social and religious [[Context]], it renders them virtually unanswerable. 

The reason for this is that both questions assume and assert within themselves, in violation of the *definition* of God, a *multiplicity* of concretized human creations or representations that can or should be grasped and chosen between. 

Each of the billions of us alive on Earth today was born into a fundamentally broken religious paradigm. For some of us, that meant being born into one of the hundreds of religious denominations or institutionalized religions who teach that they are the only way towards salvation, often on the pain of eternal damnation. For others of us, that meant being born into the rejection of some or all of those broken denominations, and a deep and also broken agnosticism. 

When I use the [[Word Tool]] "[[God]]", I am pointing *by definition* to the [[One]]. The [[Ultimate Reality]]. The [[Absolute]].  The Transcendent Ultimacy that definitionally is the Deepest and Highest. My use of the word [[God]] is not a matter of religion. It is matter of *definition.*

Rediscovering the [[One]] that is *by definition* beyond human propositional understanding, and therefore beyond religious dogma, is essential to [[Progressive Realization]] of a [[New Covenant]] mediated not by the Word, but by the Spirit.  

This involves an evolution of human conscious beyond the [[Categories]] and [[Propositional Knowledge]] we idolized and institutionalized in our collective adolescence, to re-embrace the Mystery of the Whole as One Divine Creation, the [[All]] as the manifest Body of the [[One]], permeated and animated by the Spirit of God, the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of Creation.  

As long as we [[Worship]] our Propositional Understanding of [[God]], rather than the transcendent and ineffable [[Ultimate Reality]] of [[God]] *as such*, we remain imprisoned in the devastating grasp of an idolatry that dooms us collectively towards religious, ideological, and social fragmentation and Hell. 

Conversely, when we rediscover that [[We Do Not Know]] and humbly commit to eternally learn, transform and [[Navigate Towards Truth]] together, we rediscover [[God]] as an Ultimacy not to be grasped or attained, but to be eternally Reverenced, Wrestled With, and Progressed Towards through Love by the power of Its Spirit, living within Us and All Generations of Life. 

It has been said that the most important step on ones spiritual journey is the liberation from their childhood religion. The transcendence from narrow and often fear-based conformance to a disciplinary structure, into genuine, personal, and Love-based Right Relationship with the Divine. Religions are like elementary disciplinary structures that are simultaneously necessary for education and inadequate for life. 

This dynamic plays out not only at the individual level, but also at the collective. The most important next step on our collective journey will occur when we stop bowing down to [[Propositional Idols]] and demanding that others do the same, and humbly and loving return towards Right Relationship with One and All, which is a relationship that progresses towards Ultimate Unity through Love. 

The Mission and Ideal of Christ is not religion; it is to fully embody and enact the manifest Spirit, Will, and Intention of [[God]], transcendent, universal, eternal, and ineffable, right here [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

This is the Mystery of Transcendence, Spirit, and Incarnation; the triune expression of the Ultimate Unity we are progressing back towards.
