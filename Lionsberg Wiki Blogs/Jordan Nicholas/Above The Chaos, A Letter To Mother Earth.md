# A Letter To Mother Earth
*A draft for review by the Elders, Tribes, and First Nations*

*Version 0.2, May 29, 2024*
*To be finalized and presented to the Elder Brothers and Sisters by June 2024*

Dear Mother, 
Care of the Elder Brothers, Sisters, and First Nations. 

I write to you with both great sorrow, and great hope. 

We have heard your cries. In the depths of the night. In the words of the Elder brothers and sisters. In the poisoned waters. In the plastics choking (y)our waters and lifeblood. In the dying and diseased plants, animals, and humans. In the suffering of all our relatives. In the endless mines and exploitations. In the depleted minerals. In the tiresome conflict and division among (y)our children. In the rampant lies and deceit. In the corruption and betrayal. In the grinding up of the poor, the weak, the vulnerable, and the precious in the oppressive gears of Empire and Oligarchy. In the continual ripping and raping of (y)our One Sacred Body of Life. 

You and Our Father have repeatedly warned us that the exploitation, division, and conflict on Earth will come to an end. You will have your rest and recovery. You will have your healing. You will have your renewal. You will have your regeneration. He will have His Justice. After millennia of suffering and exploitation, All Creation is crying out and longing for liberation, peace, and rest. 

We hear you when you say that there are two ways for this healing and regeneration to come about. One, by you taking your healing and rest into your own hands through the power and laws of Nature, a process by the end of which only 30% of Earth may remain. We feel the resonance with the apocalyptic visions and prophesies of old. However you and Our Father have also offered us another Higher Way, repeatedly stating that even at this late hour, if we will only remember and return to that Ancient Yet Eternal Way of being through which all aspects of Co-Creation help one another progress towards the fullness of Potential and Flourish in Harmony, Unity, and Omniconsiderate Right Relationship through Love, many can be saved, and All can once again begin to flourish. 

Through prophets from a variety of tribes and traditions who have descended from the heights to warn us, you stated that unless the governments, the sultans, the princes, presidents, and kings of the world listen and act by June 2024, within 18 months of that date only 30% of the Earth may remain. 

Through Elders around the world you have urged us to enlighten, connect, and empower at least 3% of the world's population by 2026. 

We consider this body of prophetic glimpses from tribes and peoples around the world of what lies [[Beyond The Veil]] one. 

In response to (y)our calling, over the last 7 years we have faithfully prepared the relationships and concrete networks, infrastructure, systems, and technology through which these Milestones and this Shift can be achieved. 

We felt the initial shift this spring. We felt the rising. We felt the move towards culmination. We know the Old World is coming to an end, and that the great cleansing and regeneration and at-one-ment of all things is now at hand. 

As June 2024 approaches, [[All]] can see that the rulers of the Old World have grown willfully blind and corrupt. They refuse to listen. They refuse to heed The Voice of you and Our Father. This will not change. The [[Invisible Power Structures]] puppeting the [[Visible Power Structures]] are too strong. Many of the puppets are ignorant and know not what they do. 

However We The People are listening. We The People are hearing. We the Force For Good are rising. We The People will stand with you. We The People will act. We The People will give our help where you have been injured. We The People will provide everything that is needed for your healing. We The People will liberate you and help you. 

We are listening. We are moving. We are trying. We are growing. We are rising. The Great Transformation and Liberation is now at hand. 

While we are not the rulers of the Old World, we are the humble servants of The New. We are the meek who are arising to inherit the Earth. While we are not the Kings and Priests of The Old, under The New we are All awakening to our Divine origin, rights, responsibilities, and our eternal and universal Divine Union and interexistence with our Great Father and our Great Mother. 

We are not the rulers of the Old, but we are arising to take the lead in The New. You asked for the Old Rulers to heed your voice, but it is We, the Constituents of the New, who are hearing and moving and responding, from Spirit and heart, with reciprocity, collaboration, unity, and flow. In service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Per your instructions, through careful consultation and discernment with representatives from tribes and nations around the world, we have been laying the foundations through [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] for a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] that as of March 1, 2024 is now underway. We have done our best to hear and follow your direction on Timing, and we pray it is not too late for billions of lives to be spared. As time is of the essence, we now humbly submit this offering to you, Our Father, and your Elder Children for review, discernment, improvement, and approval. 

It is a tipping point strategy, rooted in an invitational movement towards the higher consciousness, unity, reciprocity, collaboration, and flow that must mark our journey together towards [[The Promised Land]] and into the New Era. 

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] outlines the specific philosophy, theory, strategy, tactics, and means through which we will work together to equip and empower the leading 3% of most competent, enlightened, and capable leaders across this One Body of Earth by 2026 to respond to whatever needs, challenges, and opportunities arise during The Great Refounding. 

It outlines the strategies and plans of actions through which we will refashion our high science technology from its current weaponization against you and your children, into tools of flourishing and abundant life. 

It outlines the process through which we will progressively and responsibly step back from the ecocidal and omnicidal [[World War III]] that has been slowly unfolding, and reallocate our immense resources, energy, and attention to the great healing, cleansing, regeneration, and refounding of Society and the World, Masculine and Feminine, and all [[Apparent Polarities]]. 

It further articulates a comprehensive New Operating System For Humanity, guided by the intelligible [[Logos]] of [[Nature]] and based on relationship, reciprocity, collaboration, abundance and flow, enabling the greatest joint venture in human history. This New Operating System will enable the re-integration and re-coherence of the Human Species with the Living System it is a part of. 

We understand that all life is Sacred. We understand that the Divine Spark is present not just in one tribe or denomination, not just in one species, but in every fragment of Reality unfurling itself from the The Divine Source and Fountain from which All Life and Consciousness flows. We understand that All Creation is One Interexistent Body, and we rededicate our existence to eternal, universal, and omniconsiderate co-creation in partnership with you and Our Father. 

Father, please move Heaven and Earth on our behalf. Please unleash the abundant resources, power, and authority required to vanquish corruption, injustice, and oppression in all their forms, liberate our Mother, and collaborate together in harmony and joy as we eternally and universally Co-Create The New. 

We are awakening, we are arising, and we coming Mother. Hold fast. Be still. Your liberation is at hand. 

To the Elder Brothers and Sisters of Earth: The Eagle and the Condor, the Masculine and Feminine, the North, West, East, and South are uniting and begin to spread their wings; they now prepare to ascend towards the heavens and fly together. 

We look to you to discern and advise how [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] must be improved to be as Wise, Right, Good, and True as possible, and what resources and support you and our Mother require to heal, restore, and regenerate our lives, our society, and our world. 

We propose a first General Assembly meeting in late September 2024, and we invite every bioregion and tribe of the Earth to nominate representatives they consider to be most wise and respected to come and take their respective seats at the Round Table. 

We invite all bioregions, watersheds, and tribes of the Earth into a New process of locally and collectively rediscovering and discerning the Vision, Values, Strategies, and Prioritized Plans of Action that will land humanity and our planet on safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]].   We further invite all peoples to locally and collectively rapidly develop coordinated disaster resilience and recovery plans so that we are prepared to forthrightly meet whatever necessary convulsions and upheavals may have already been irreversibly set in motion. 

Time is of the essence, and none of us can do this in isolation. We are One Body of Co-Creation, advancing together towards a Continually More Perfect Union.  

With deep love and respect to Our Father, Our Mother, the Elders, and all our relations, 

~ Jordan on behalf of the rising Body of Lionsberg Co-Creators
