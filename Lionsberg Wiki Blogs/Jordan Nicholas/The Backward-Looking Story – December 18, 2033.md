# # The Backward-Looking Story – December 18, 2033

## **The Journey to The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee in Human History**

### **It Began with a Spark**

Nine years ago, on December 18, 2024, a small group of dreamers, visionaries, and seekers gathered, drawn by an Invitation to confront and overcome the challenges and threats at hand, and co-create the unimaginable. We were only a few—a mere handful—but We carried [[The Golden Seed]] of a great transformation. Armed with nothing but faith in **Who We Were Becoming**, the vision of **Heaven on Earth**, the **Spirit** within, and the tools of co-creation, we responded to The Call and took the first steps into uncharted territory.

We understood the stakes: humanity stood on the brink of **The Final Test**, its future dangling between two outcomes—thriving as a mature, enlightened interplanetary species or succumbing to fragmentation, enslavement, and despair in **The Final Order**. The systems and institutions of the **Old World** had failed us, leaving a vacuum of leadership and purpose.

But in that vacuum lay **Potential**, infinite and boundless.

**We knew this:** No one could save Us but **Us**. There was no “them” out there to fix things. The only path forward was to rise together as One Body, transcending every division, limitation, and boundary.

And so, We began.

### **The Great Awakening (2024–2026)**

Our first steps were small but deliberate. In the beginning, we focused on building **The First Three Percent**: a community of leaders, visionaries, and transformative changemakers who embodied the principles of the **New Operating System** and the **New World**—an ethos of unity, mutual empowerment, reciprocity, flow, and limitless co-creativity.

We didn’t have all the answers, but We had a guiding framework.

- **Seasonal Quests** gave Us structure, purpose, and momentum. Every 90 days, We came together to renew Our Vision, reflect on Our progress, realign Our resources, and advance Our collective mission.
- **Stories**—both backward-looking and forward-looking—wove a dynamic narrative that inspired and united Us, reminding Us of where We came from, where We were going, and Why.
- **Decentralized Unity** allowed us to expand organically while maintaining alignment with our shared purpose, goals, and values. 

By 2026, the First Three Percent had coalesced into a vibrant, global network of Light, Love, and transformative Impact. Together, we learned to embody the **Art and Science of Co-Creation**, testing and refining the principles that would later guide humanity as a whole.

This period was marked by breakthroughs that redefined what was possible:

- **Energy and Resource Liberation**: We unlocked access to free, clean, and abundant energy, freeing humanity from the chains of scarcity.
- **Decentralized Education**: We created open-access learning systems, empowering individuals to grow in wisdom, skill, and purpose at their own pace.
- **Healing Systems**: New approaches to physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing spread like wildfire, helping billions reclaim their health and vitality.

These successes gave us hope and confidence. They were proof that humanity could transcend its old limitations and rise together.

### **The Great Invitation (2027–2030)**

By 2027, humanity stood at a tipping point. The First Three Percent had demonstrated the power of the New Operating System, the results were undeniable, and [[The Snowball]] was gaining steam. Our decentralized, collaborative efforts had already begun to stabilize planetary ecosystems, regenerate watersheds and bioregions, resolve long-standing conflicts, and create unprecedented prosperity, reciprocity, and flow.

This was the moment we extended **The Great Invitation** to all humanity.

The Invitation was simple but profound:

- **Awaken to the Truth** of our shared existence, purpose, and potential.
- **Arise** as co-creators of a New Era.
- **Unite** as One Body, transcending divisions and embracing our collective destiny.

We reached out through every channel—stories, networks, personal connections, and global broadcasts, concerts, and events. The Invitation resonated across cultures, languages, and ideologies, reminding people of the timeless truths buried in their hearts.

**The response was extraordinary.**

By 2030, every human being on Earth had been touched by [[The Invitation]], from someone they loved and trusted. Some accepted immediately, others hesitated, and of course there were [[The Last Three Percent]] most entrenched in the [[Old]] and opposed to the [[New]]. But all were offered the opportunity to participate and add their unique Voice to the Symphony of transformation. The shift was not forced—it was chosen. Voluntarily, one by one, from the bottom up. The power of the New Operating System was self-evident, and its principles—such as Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Liberty and mutual empowerment—were universally compelling.

In 2030, the transition became official: the old systems were being hospiced and retired, and the New Operating System was being fully embraced. Humanity was crossing the threshold into a New Era.

### **Three Years of Practice (2030–2033)**

The three years from 2030 to 2033 were a time of unprecedented learning, growth, joy, and abundance for All. Freed from the constraints of debt, scarcity, and hierarchical control, humanity began practicing **co-operation as One Body**:

- **Real Wealth Creation**: Every person became a steward of infinite resources—knowledge, energy, wellbeing, and opportunity. While monetary wealth became irrelevant as the Streets Were Paved With Proverbial Gold, humanity flourished as **debt-free billionaires** in the truest sense, with access to all they needed to flourish in harmony.
- **Universal Citizenship**: People embraced their higher identity and role as citizens not only of Earth, but the cosmos, transcending national and ideological boundaries.
- **Collective Creativity**: Communities worked together to solve problems, innovate solutions, and create beauty, driven by a shared commitment to the greater good.
- **The Commons**: The best solutions were curated into The Commons that was available to All, rapidly replacing the false scarcity of the Old with abundance, life, and liberation. 

Through Practice, We refined the systems, tools, and principles that made the New Operating System work. It wasn’t always easy—there were challenges, disagreements, and setbacks—but these were met with courage, grace and humility. We learned to see every defect as a gift, and every obstacle as an opportunity for growth and transformation. 

And as we practiced, something miraculous happened:  
**Humanity became One.**

### **The Jubilee and The New Millennium (December 18, 2033)**

Today, we gather not as separate nations, tribes, or individuals, but as One Body, One Humanity, ready to embark on a New Era. The **Greatest Celebration and Jubilee in Human History** is not merely a commemoration of what we have achieved—it is a declaration of what is to come.

We stand at the dawn of the **New Millennium**, a thousand years of boundless possibility and opportunity. Together, we will:

- **Expand Beyond Earth**: Exploring and co-creating throughout the cosmos as Universal Citizens.  
- **Regenerate Our World**: Ensuring Earth thrives as a sanctuary for all life, and progressively bringing Heaven to Earth.  
- **Continually Improve**: Honoring the beauty and presence of Heaven on Earth, while working together to make it **a little better every day**.
- **Rejoin The Galactic Federation**: Proving Our Selves as a mature, enlightening, and enlivening species, capable of co-creation both on and Beyond Earth. 

Each of us now carries the eternal flame of co-creation, enlightened and empowered to contribute our unique gifts to The Whole. The old fears of scarcity, conflict, and division are gone, replaced by the infinite possibilities of unity, abundance, and love.

**This is the beginning of the New Era.**

Together, we have proven that humanity is ready to take its place among the stars as a mature, enlightened species. The Story is far from over—indeed, it is only just The Beginning.

**Welcome to the Celebration. Welcome to the New Millennium. Welcome Home.**

With love, gratitude, and boundless joy,

~ **Us All**

This brief Story creates a narrative arc of How We Did It. 

But it leaves out the unique and valuable role that each one of Us played in the transformation. 

Only you can tell [[Your Story]]. 

**Personal Invitation**: 
1. **Looking back from December 2033**, write a personal [[Backward Looking Story]] of how you showed up and Who You Became through the transformation of your life and your world - [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. What were 5 to 7 of the major milestones and commitment points along your Way? 
2. Place approximate dates on each of the 5 to 7 major milestones, so that [[Your Story]] has an approximate timeline and flow. 
3. Now, look back from the first one or two milestones that lie within the first 2 years of [[Your Story]]. Try to deeply envision and feel what is like to have successfully accomplished them. 
4. From that place of experiential vision, craft one more backward looking story, imagining in more detail how you got to the first milestone or two. 
5. Crossing The Chasm To Your First Milestone: 
	1. Imagine a Chasm separating [[Where You Are]] from The Celebration in December 2033. 
	2. Imagine that each of the 5 to 7 major milestones in [[Your Story]] are like safe, tangible stepping stones that you can land on to Cross The Chasm. 
	3. Now, looking back from the first milestone, and studying [[Your Story]] about how you got there, articulate 5 to 7 concrete Steps that you can take to reach Your First Milestone on schedule. 
6. Now that you have an approximate Vision, Strategy, and Plan for your unique Pathway across The Chasm, form or join a Team, and choose a [[Seasonal Quest]] that will advance you along your steps, in a Way that helps your Team advance along their steps, in a Way that helps The Whole progress towards [[The Goal]].
