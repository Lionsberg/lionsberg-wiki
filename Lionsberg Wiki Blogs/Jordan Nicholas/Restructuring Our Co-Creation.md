# Restructuring Our Co-Creation

Dear Force For Good... 

You may have seen [[Jordan's Final Report]] and [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]] it UnVeiled. 

With Jordan's Old Life gone... and Whatever We Are Becoming rising from The Ashes... 

...We are winding down the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]], an aspect of which was rooted in participation and compliance in the Old System...

...and **restructuring Our Co-Creation**. 
____
Whereas [[Jordan]] was willing to do his best to comply with the Old Authorities, based on his experience and having read his [[Jordan's Final Report|Final Report]]...

...We are unwilling to consent to, comply with, or participate in a fraudulent and omnicidal Existing Order bent on [[Full Spectrum Dominance]] and Exploitation of the Earth and All its inhabitants.
___
What that means is that We are going to ***restructure Our Co-Creation transcendent of every power and authority on Earth***...

...on the basis of ***our spiritual and moral right and duty to co-operate as [[One Body]]*** to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals in whatever domains of SpaceTime We find Our Selves in. 
___
Citizens of Goodwill have the inherent right and responsibility under Universal Law (and many [[Local Laws]]) to: 

1. Voluntarily associate and advance together towards the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] in service of [[One]] and [[All]]  
2. Aggregate and allocate Time, Energy, Attention, and Resources towards shared Goals and Values   
3. And to do so in any Way the Spirit and dictates of their own Conscience lead them, in obedience to the Spirit of the [[Universal Law]], and regardless of [[Local Laws]]

A valid spiritual assembly does not require permission or recognition from any authority on Earth to exist.  
___
We are therefore exercising the Divine and Inalienable Right and Responsibility, self-evident in Universal Law and echoed in places like the Declaration of Independence, to withdraw Our participation, consent, and contribution to the fraudulent and tyrannical Existing Order, and take up Our Sovereign, separate and transcendent place among the powers of the Universe. 

And inviting All others to do the same. 
___
Our immediate Mission then becomes to Co-Create, out of the Chaos, Tyranny, and Ashes of the Old, ***a New System and Order that is Good***. 

***What is required is nothing short of the fundamental refounding of human civilization on Earth.*** 
___
The trillions of dollars that must be intelligently aggregated and allocated by the emerging [[New Ecosystem]] will [[Flow]] through an [[Interoperable]] and [[Optimally Decentralized]] network of sovereign, autonomous, and self-governing [[Centers of Distribution]] co-operating across various [[Levels of Analysis]]. 
___
To play Our Part in the emergent [[New System]], We are establishing a simple mechanism called [[The Founder's Fund]].  

[[The Founder's Fund]] will have two purposes: 

1. To resource [[J]] and his immediate team of co-creators 
2. To serve as a Center of Distribution, allocating excess resources to [[Quarterly Quests]] that advance the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]]  

Our goal for [[The Founder's Fund]] is to be allocating billions of dollars of quarterly [[Flow]] across the emerging ecosystem of Goodwill as rapidly as possible. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] was co-created to make this previously impossible feat possible. 
___
## Accelerating Into 2025

As discussed in [[Existential Threat - Reporting Back From Battle]], things are about to get really interesting between 2025 and 2030. 

Some How, some Way, We need to ramp up to billions of dollars of [[Quarterly Flow]]. Quickly. 

Between November and December 2024, We are evaluating and selecting the three most Valuable [[Quarterly Quests]] We can identity, and aggregating resources to apply thereto. 

The resources will come into [[The Founder's Fund]], enabling [[J]] and a small [[Team of Teams]] to **FOCUS** their [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] for the next 90 days. 

Excess resources will be applied to the [[Critical Path]]. 

At the end of each Quarter, We will tell The Story and report out on [[Progress]], announce the next [[Quarterly Quests]] and Teams, aggregate the next round of resources, and then embark on the next Quarterly Quest.   

The system is designed for this reciprocating cycle to fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]]. 
____
## Team of Teams + A New Operating System

[[The Lionsberg Co-Creator Handbook]] lays out the basic tools and principles of the [[New System]]. 

Those who want to co-create with [[J]] or receive resources from [[The Founder's Fund]], must be willing and able to embody the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]].  

____
[[The Founder's Fund]] and [[J's Team]] will be governed by [[J]] and those he personally invites to co-create. 

You can [[Trust]] and allocate resources to them if you can [[Trust]] [[J]]. 

Similarly, every other aspect of The [[New System]] must be [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]].
