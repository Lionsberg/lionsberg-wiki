# Above The Chaos, Thoughts


The world is [[Intelligible]]. We can understand it. We can progressively make sense of it. 

The universe is [[Intelligible]]. We can understand it. We can progressively make sense of it. 

[[Reality]] is [[Intelligible]]. We can understand it. We can progressively make sense of it. 

What must the underlying [[Nature]] of [[Reality]] be, such that we [[Perceive]] it through our limited [[Spacetime User Interface]] as consistently and universally [[Intelligible]]?

[[Understanding]] is [[Superordinate]] to [[Knowledge]]. 

Understanding relates to the grasp of the meaning, reason, or logic behind what is Known. The ability to [[Comprehend]] not only [[What Is]], but [[How]] and [[Why]] it is. The ability to grasp the [[Nature]] or significance of something.

___
Issues

Environment and Climate 
- My [[Current Best Understanding]] is that we are in the midst of large scale environmental transformations that are both natural and influenced by humanity. 
- We cannot control the natural movements, however we can and must be the most faithful stewards we can of this beautiful and fragile planet that has been entrusted to us. 
- We are currently failing in this regard. 

Supply Chains 
- Cobalt and Lithium mines in Africa... the abuses of the children. 

[[Vision]]  
- Two cannot walk together unless they are aligned. A vessel pulled in different directions will be torn asunder. 
- Alignment proceeds from shared [[Vision]]. 
- We must dialogue with one another. We must cross the boundaries that have separate us and talk, so that we can discover a shared Vision, and begin moving together voluntarily towards it. 
- Governance based on power, coercion, and threat is by definition failure. 
- Top down compulsion is by definition failed governance. 

- Developing a shared Vision. 
- Discovering the pathways and milestones that mark the Way, and bringing everyone along voluntarily. 

- Finding places and prototypes where [[It Might Work]], learning, and telling the stories. 
- Those stories then become Prophesies of even greater things that are possible. 

___



___
Measurements
- Units of nitrogen used per units of food produced. 

___
Property and Stewardship 

- In times past, people were viewed as something that could be owned and exploited. People bought, beat, raped, and exploited other human beings. We know have nearly universal laws that prohibit owning another human being. And although we still do it and tolerate it, we understand it violates the [[Universal Law]] to harm or exploit [[One Another]]. 
	- In the [[New World]], we will not harm or exploit [[One Another]], nor tolerate such behavior by any.  
- In times past, we viewed animals as something that could be owned and exploited. People bought, beat, and exploited animals. We now have nearly universal laws that prohibit exploiting or harming animals. And although we still do it and tolerate it, we understand that it violates the [[Universal Law]] to harm or exploit animals. 
	- In the [[New World]], we will not harm or exploit animals, nor tolerate such behavior by others. 
- In times present, we view land as something that can be owned and exploited. People buy, rape, and exploit land. Although we still do it and tolerate it, we understand that it violates the [[Universal Law]] to harm or exploit Mother Earth. 
	- In the [[New World]], we will not harm or exploit the land, nor tolerate such behavior by others. 

The basic [[Rights And Responsibilities]] of humanity put us in a position of stewardship of [[All]] that belongs to [[One]]. Ownership and control are brief illusions. Universal, eternal, and [[All]]-encompassing [[Stewardship]] are the [[Way]]. 

___
[[Materiality]] 

The entire [[Materiality]] of our existence must be re-examined, re-imagined, and re-integrated within the [[Boundaries]] and [[Generalized Principles]] of the [[Living System]]. 

[[Hypothesis]]: This requires that we consciously balance [[Energy Accounting]] within each local [[Bio Region]]. 

___



___


My [[Current Best Understanding]] is that human, organizational, and community development follows a basic hierarchy of needs and opportunities. 

Maslov's hierarchy of needs, Spiral Dynamics, Piaget's work, community and national development learnings, and other basic paradigms illuminate the reality that our development towards higher levels of culture, aesthetics, environmental stewardship, and transcendence occurs in stages that are facilitated by first meeting our basic physiological, security, and relational needs. 

The aggregate of recent learning and experience reinforces that there is a basic milestone that includes (something like) a safe, peaceful community in which a person is earning above a minimum basic level of income, which studies have shown is shockingly low (say $5,000 / year GDP as a global average), after which people "open up" and begin to have the capacity for greater cultural and environmental stewardship and goals. 

Recall that a recent world bank report stated that **over 3 billion people presently live on less than $6.85 / day ($2,500 / year)** (2017 Purchasing Price Parity), a marker that represents the average of the poverty lines of upper-middle-income countries. 

Our goal should not be merely to lift people out of desperate and abject poverty. 

It should be to lift one another up to where we have enough safety, security, and opportunity that we can truly start to care about one another, our environment, and future generations. 

Therefore we are proposing that we immediately set a [[Milestones|Milestone]] at twice the $6.85 marker, or $13.70 (2017 PPP), which equates to $5,000 / year, in a community whose basic peace and security have been secured. 

Securing peace and $5,000 / year in universal basic income is something that can only be achieved through the united will, vision and intention of the global community. 

Ensuring that 5.5 billion people (~70% of population) have a minimum of $5,000 in income requires that $27.5 Trillion flows to them each year. This is only about 1/3 of current global GDP. 

Think about that - in order to lift every human being on earth out of abject poverty and suffering, and up to a level in which they had the security, relationships, and capacity to prioritize the multi-generational stewardship of our culture and environment, would merely require a global economic system that was just enough to ensure that the bottom 2/3 of humanity had access to 1/3 of present GDP - in the current state! 

This does not even begin to take into the account the massive explosion of value creation that would occur if all humanity had equal access to the emergent Lionsberg | [[Energy Net]], Lionsberg | [[Water Net]], and Lionsberg | [[Info Net]].  

If we can work together to secure this milestone, we will emerge from the greatest joint effort in human history with, for the first time in history, the basic peace, relative prosperity, and goodwill among all nations and peoples required for us to move together beyond that milestone towards our best and highest potential. 

From that plateau we will be able to view our higher order personal, community, and global development goals in an entirely new light. 

Against this higher shared Vision and Intention, the harsh reality is that an Analysis of existing forces and conditions reveals that over 2/3 of us around the world currently fall below this line.
