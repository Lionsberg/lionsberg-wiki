# Rediscovering Humanity's Cosmic Narrative - Ancient Myths, Sacred Texts, and the Modern Disclosure Movement

Across millennia, humanity has turned to myths, sacred texts, and ancestral stories to seek answers to its most profound questions: Where do we come from? What is our purpose? Are we alone? These narratives, dismissed by some as allegory, shimmer with truths that invite a reevaluation in light of modern scientific discoveries, archeological mysteries, and recent revelations of extraterrestrial contact.

When approached as living history laden with Truth, these ancient accounts converge into a kaleidoscopic tapestry—a narrative of contact, hybridization, and shared technological knowledge between humanity and advanced non-human intelligences. This cosmic story, veiled in symbolism and myth, now emerges as essential for understanding our origins, our present challenges, and our potential futures as a species.

### **Divine Councils and Celestial Rulers**

The archetype of divine councils appears across cultures and epochs. In the Hebrew tradition, the **Elohim** report to **El Elyon**, a title meaning "the Most High" or "the one above." Similarly, Greek and Homeric stories describe the **Theoi**, functionaries under the rule of **Zeus**, whose name translates to "Sky Father." These beings, far from abstract deities, are portrayed as ***embodied rulers*** of creation, governing nations, warring over domains, and guiding human progress.

The Hebrew Bible hints at this cosmic hierarchy in Deuteronomy 32:8: _"When Elyon divided the nations, he allotted them according to the number of the children of the Elohim."_ This passage, deceptively mistranslated in many bibles produced for the masses, depicts a deliberate partitioning of Earth among a group of embodied beings, with each nation governed by a celestial being. Yahweh, for example, was assigned the descendants of Jacob, while other Elohim governed other peoples. Greek philosopher Plato mirrors this idea in _Critias_, describing how the gods divided the Earth by lot and ruled over humanity essentially as domesticated livestock.

Beyond the Middle East and Greece, similar motifs emerge worldwide. Indian epics like the _Ramayana_ describe celestial beings wielding advanced weaponry and piloting flying machines, or [[Vimanas]]. In Mesoamerican and Norse traditions, star beings are credited with imparting knowledge and shaping civilization. According to the wisdom keepers of Africa, every tribe will tell you that the system of kingship descended from the skies, with the [[Chitauri]] dominating, breeding, shepherding, and harvesting humans. Just as is told in the tablets and stories from Mesopotamia, some of which are older versions of the stories that would eventually be redacted and find their way into the old testament of the bible. 

Those tempted to explain this away as ancient myth will have to figure out how it is that up until the modern day, in some parts of Africa the non-human creatures piloting these advanced trans-medium craft are *eaten* when their bodies are occasionally recovered from crashed craft. 

These narratives, ancient memories, and present day experiences, shared nearly universally among indigenous tribes according to the elders, suggest an *ancient and ongoing* pattern of interaction between humanity and advanced [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]], marginalized by the ruling elite as myth, but rooted in a deeper and far more unsettling reality.

From the Elohim of the Old Testament to the Theoi of Greek tales, from the watchers of the Ethiopian _Book of Enoch_ to the Nagas of Indian tradition, from the Chitauri of South Africa to the Nommo of Dogon, from the Annunaki of Babylon to the Sky People of the Americas and Aboriginals, humanity's sacred stories universally describe ***incarnate non-human beings*** of immense power, knowledge, and technology, who shaped civilizations and guided their development and destruction. In many cases, these beings are portrayed as both benefactors and rulers, imparting knowledge while exercising absolute dominion. In others, ruthless domination and demands for human and animal sacrifices are the tyrannical norm. Still in others, certain types of beings function as watchers or scientists, more passively observing the experiment of Life in the Living Laboratory of Earth. 

These beings, often referred to by functional names implying rulership or dictatorship, are now increasingly recognized in modern discourse as a diversity of extraterrestrial, crytoterrestrial, interdimensional, and / or ultradimensional visitors and residents—advanced ***and embodied*** [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] whose interactions with humanity have left an indelible mark on our collective consciousness, our past, and our future. Far from being abstract deities or hallucinations, these are ***physical and energetic functionaries with specific roles and responsibilities***. 

#### A Modern Day Armada Over Europe

According to Paul Hellyer, former Canadian minister of defense, in the years following World War II, Allied forces reported an unprecedented phenomenon: fleets of unidentified flying objects observed over Europe and beyond. These craft displayed capabilities far surpassing known human technology, including silent flight, rapid acceleration, and abrupt directional changes that defied the known laws of physics. After a particularly large armada of these craft passed over Europe, the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces authorized a comprehensive investigation. This study lasted several years, eventually concluding that multiple extraterrestrial species had been visiting Earth for thousands of years, significantly influencing Earth's history over timespans far greater than humanity's modern history of the last ten thousand years. 

#### Hybridization and the Creation of Giants

Another recurring theme in ancient literature and modern human experience is hybridization—the blending of human and non-human genetics, and the jealous guarding of certain lineages by extraterrestrial factions. For example, Genesis 6 in the bible describes the Nephilim, a race of six-fingered giants born of the union between the "sons of the Elohim" and human women. Similar accounts appear in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and Indian texts, which describe giants as hybrids between gods and humans. These beings often possessed extraordinary abilities and deeply influenced human civilization. Interestingly, US soldiers reported encountering, and having colleagues killed by, 12 to 15 foot tall, ~2,000 pound, red-haired, six fingered giants living in the mountains and caves of Afghanistan. 

In India, the Nagas—reptilian beings with transformative powers—are said to have founded entire civilizations, and are revered as ***progenitors of human civilization***. Cambodian legends trace the origins of their monarchy to a naga queen, while Mesoamerican stories describe ***feathered serpents*** like Quetzalcoatl, who brought knowledge and civilization. Even today, tribes in India and Sri Lanka claim descent from the Nagas, emphasizing their enduring cultural significance. Again, US soldiers reported encountering 7' to 9' tall, upright, reptilian creatures in the tunnels and caves of Vietnam, well known to local residents. 

Perhaps even more shockingly, multiple credible military sources testify to ***working side by side*** with reptilians and other non-human intelligences at secret "black sites". The reptilians are described as being referred to with titles such "your highness", and playing a ***guiding role*** in the development of advanced technology, weaponry, and ***genetic experimentation***. 

These rediscoveries deeply challenge orthodox narratives of human history, suggesting that our ancestors interacted with beings possessing advanced biological and technological capabilities, and that certain human factions continue to collaborate with them to this day. 

#### Ancient Technologies and the Evidence of Advanced Knowledge

The technological sophistication described in ancient texts raises profound questions. Indian scriptures reference **Kumbhas**—gestation pods capable of creating life outside the human body. Accompanied by carvings depicting cell division and embryonic development, ***these pervasive descriptions predate modern embryology by millennia***. The _Ramayana_ details flying machines and precision weaponry that rival contemporary technological advancements.

Symbols like the handbag and pinecone, depicted in carvings from Mesopotamia, India, and South America, hint at advanced technologies and cognitive / psionic capabilities. These motifs, repeatedly recurring in vastly disparate cultures, suggest ***a shared legacy*** of knowledge, tools, and artifacts central to the functions of the advanced [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] they were interacting with. In many stories and depictions, these symbols and technologies appear amidst scenes of battle or non-human intervention, hinting at their significance in shaping events.

Monolithic sites such as the Pyramids of the Americas, Egypt, and China, Solomon's Temple, Göbekli Tepe, and the Coral Castle further underscore the possibility of lost technologies. For instance at Coral Castle, multi-ton stones move with a mere touch, while monoliths from South America, to Lebanon, to Egypt, India, and the middle East demonstrate the movement of stones weighing hundreds of tons over great distances in the ancient past. Many of these sites defy not only ancient, but even modern standards of engineering. When the locals are asked about construction, they inevitably insist that they were built by a previous civilization with non-human technologies, and describe massive blocks being "floated" into position.  

While humanity's most sacred stories are arrogantly derided by orthodox-kontrolled  archeologists, scientists, politicians, and priests, over the coming years as [[The Great UnVeiling]] progresses, humanity will ReMember that they are True. 

#### Modern Disclosure: Connecting Ancient Narratives to Contemporary Revelations

In recent decades, revelations surrounding UFOs and UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) have reignited interest in humanity's ancient stories. Since 2017, a pattern of semi-official leaks, congressional hearings, and whistleblower testimonies has revealed government programs dedicated to reverse-engineering alien technology. These disclosures, corroborated by figures like Jacques Vallée, Daniel Sheehan, and Chris Mellon, suggest that Western governments have been in contact with advanced non-human visitors and residents for at least decades - and perhaps much longer. 

The 2023 congressional hearings marked a turning point, with witnesses confirming the recovery of non-human craft ***and pilots***. Figures such as Haim Eshed, former head of Israel's space program, have stated that contact with extraterrestrial civilizations dates back to at least the Truman administration. These extraterrestrial neighbors, according to Eshed, are collaborating with human factions in bases on Earth, the moon, and Mars, awaiting humanity's broader readiness to join a federation of spacefaring civilizations. The Pentagon, for the first time since the 1940s, acknowledged the existence of units devoted to analyzing extraterrestrial materials. Despite the taboo surrounding these topics after decades of [[Mind Kontrolle]], the evidence continues to mount, supported by testimonies from intelligence officials, astronauts, psychiatrists, and scientists.

This aligns with indigenous stories that speak of star beings imparting knowledge. The Dogon people of Africa recount astronomical and civilizational insights granted by beings from Sirius, while many Native American and Aboriginal traditions honor beings from Pleiades as their cosmic ancestors. These extraordinary parallels invite a reexamination of sacred texts and cultural narratives as ***living testimonies of a shared cosmic heritage.***

#### ### **Reframing Sacred Stories in a Populated Universe**

Words like _Elohim_ and _Theos_, originally descriptors of roles and functions, were later ***intentionally mistranslated*** into proper nouns. Coupled with profound and deceitful redactions, this progressively obscured their original meaning. The Ethiopian _Book of Enoch_ recounts the Watchers, celestial beings who shared arts, crafts, and agriculture with humanity. Indigenous myths worldwide speak of similar cultural exchanges with [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]], often portraying contact as a vital force in humanity's advancement.

However, these stories were suppressed. The ~sixth-century BCE revision of what is now known as the old testament, and subsequent redactions under the Roman and English empires, progressively transformed stories about various tribes of people and their experience with a diversity of advanced [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] into the dogmatic orthodoxies humanity is psychically kontrolled by to this day. This deliberate obfuscation perpetuated an intentionally falsified paradigm that isolates and stifles humanity's understanding and potential. 

Modern disclosures shatter these false narratives, compelling us to revisit our most sacred texts and rediscover their deeper and truer meanings. By revisiting these sacred texts, honoring their authors, and treating the sacred stories as if they were True, we can rebridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary revelations, reilluminating humanity's place in a diversely populated and inherently interconnected universe of ongoing intelligent co-creation. 

#### Philosophical and Spiritual Implications of Contact

Acknowledging a populated universe poses profound challenges to human philosophy, faith, and governance. The Catholic Church has grappled with these questions, with figures like Rev. Dr. Guy Consolmagno advocating for readiness to engage with extraterrestrial beings. Father Corrado Balducci, a Vatican theologian, emphasized that encounters with non-human entities should be studied seriously, as they differ from demonic or psychotic experiences. According to [[Daniel Sheehan]], former Jesuit general council, senior Vatican officials acknowledge that "In light of the discovery of more and more of these exoplanets, **it has now become clear that *much sooner than previously anticipated* we are going to discover life elsewhere in our universe**, and because of that, the time has now arrived for the beginning of a serious discussion among all of our people about what are the most profound philosophical and theological questions are, that are going to be posed to our human family, by the discovery of life elsewhere in our universe.""We are not talking about the discovery of just some single celled life form underneath a frozen lake on the moon of some distant planet. **We are talking here about another highly intelligent, highly technologically developed but distinctly non-human species right here in our own galaxy.**" 

The Vatican and other [[Visible Power Structures]] are hard at work to ensure that they do not get caught behind the **power curve** associated with the revelation to humanity of a vast diversity of advanced [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] within and beyond Earth. 

This process of official [[Controlled Disclosure]] represents a massive challenge for institutions that will now be seen as jointly complicit in perpetrating [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]. 

Despite these open admissions by both political and religious officials, societal fear and generations of suppression have hindered open discussion. For centuries, institutions have ***rewritten texts and ridiculed experiences that suggest extraterrestrial contact***. As humanity now awakens and faces [[The Final Test]], what We choose to do next will determine the fate of billions of people, for millennia to come. 

#### The Call to Action: Preparing for Humanity's Leap Forward

As we stand on the cusp of a new era, it is imperative to confront the implications of modern disclosure. The reverse-engineering of alien materials offers the potential for zero-point energy, interstellar travel, and transformative new technologies. Yet, these technologies remain under the control of a illegal and fraudulent militarized-industrial complex that has stolen trillions of dollars, murdered millions of people, and become one of the largest traffickers of humans, weapons, and drugs in the world. Operating far beyond the authority of any constitutional government on Earth, it collaborates with [[Non-Human Intelligence (NHI)]] towards profoundly anti-human and antithetical ends. 

It is up to Us, The People, to decide who will represent Us in these engagements. The most advanced technologies, fraudulently funded with trillions of Our dollars and currently weaponized by multiple governments against foreign adversaries as well as "their" populations at home, belong to Us All. 

If We so chose, We could awaken, arise, escape [[The Trap]], pass [[The Final Test]], and co-create heaven on Earth in partnership with forces and intelligences beyond our imagination. The leap forward into the [[New Era]] belongs to All of Us, not a small fascist elite intent on keeping Us dependent, endarkened, and kontrolled. It is Our responsibility to ensure that the profound benefits of the [[New Civilization]] are shared among Us [[All]] equally and justly. 

The leap to becoming a spacefaring species is not merely technological—it is spiritual, philosophical, and communal. It requires us to transcend fear, embrace our true identity, and unite in Our Divine origins, purpose, and destiny. 

The [[Controlled Disclosure]] being deceitfully unfurled by the false authorities of [[Existing Order]] cannot be trusted. The realization of these Truths must arise from within each of Us, from within Our most sacred and ancient stories, and from the grassroots of Our modern experience. 

The official [[Controlled Disclosure]] is merely the public admission of [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]]. 

What We The People choose to do next will determine the future for billions of lives over millennia to come. This is [[The Final Test]]. 

#### Conclusion: Rediscovering Our Cosmic Identity

The stories of the Elohim, Theoi, Nagas, [[Chitauri]], Sky People and Watchers are not mythical relics of a bygone era but living memories that connect us to a greater cosmic story. They remind us that humanity's journey through the universe towards the fullness of its Potential is not isolated but interwoven with the guidance, influence, and oppositions of beings from beyond. As we uncover the truth behind these myths and engage with modern revelations, we are called to transcend fear and embrace a vision of Divine unity, sovereignty, and co-creation.

This is humanity's moment. The stories of our ancestors echo with a timeless invitation: to remember who we are, to rise together, to reclaim our sovereignty, and to take up our rightful place among the stars. The leap forward belongs to all of us. It is Ours to take—Together as [[ONE Bodyx]].
