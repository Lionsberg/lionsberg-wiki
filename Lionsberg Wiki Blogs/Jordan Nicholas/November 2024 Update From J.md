# November 2024 Update From J

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

**A One Minute Read**: 

Dear Loved Ones and Collaborators, 

The last 5 years have sure been an adventure, haven't they? 

We are collectively facing into the greatest fraud, deception, and existential threat in human history. 

The American Experiment is over. 

The Existing Order is collapsing. 

The building is on fire. Our Loved Ones are in danger. 

The forces we are up against are *not merely human.*

And the person you knew as [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], along with many others, suffered and died over the last five years in the process of Revealing it. 

His final report and short story can be accessed via the links below. 

If what attacked him and what he discovered are True... and advanced non-human intelligences are actually at war over the future of the Earth and the human species... 

...it changes everything. For everyone. 

As for What We Are Becoming, We cannot in good conscience continue to participate in, comply with, resource, or support an Existing Order that has been revealed to be omnicidal, alien, and fraudulent in its inception. 

We are therefore dissolving the Lionsberg legal infrastructure along with all of Jordan's commitments and agreements, and regrouping Beyond the reach of every power and authority on Earth. 

Whether We Become a mighty army, confront and overcome the existential threat at hand, and Co-Create Heaven On Earth, or perish homeless and alone, depends on what We All decide to do next. 

Please take a few minutes to at least skim through the first link and [[Jordan's Final Report]]. If what Jordan discovered is True, it might save your life and your Loved Ones. 

Government agents are not talking about a return of "the gods" and "the world's fair" in 2027 for nothing, and there is a reason this is being called the last semi-democratic election in the failed American Experiment. 

If We do not speak again, please know that Jordan loved you deeply. 

If you would like to continue building upon who Jordan was becoming and the starting point he left behind, We are here to serve, Time is short, and We look forward to getting to know One Another again. Despite Our Apparent Individuation, We Are One.
