# Above The Chaos, A Simplified Way Towards The Goal 

Having learned a lot the last two years, we are simplifying ***focus*** for 2024. 

Our ***Mission*** is the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven. This is not a matter of religious belief; it is a matter of uniting around the highest Spirit, Intention, and Goal, vanquishing corruption and injustice, and reestablishing proper order and right relationship out of the present chaos. 

Pragmatically, this requires assembling an ***independent body***, transcendent of the existing systems and structures, that is actually capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems at hand. A body requires a Way / System / Structure that enables co-operation.  

I am seeking a rogue band of passionate, independent, and committed ***Individuals*** who resonate and are willing to sacrifice, take responsibility, and do the hard work required to arise, unite, and ***Become*** a powerful and perpetual ***Force For Good***. 

I can offer as a starting point an ***Invitation*** to the ***Adventure*** of a lifetime, my self, my network, and the millions of dollars in systems, infrastructure, and technology we have assembled for this purpose, as well as an ongoing program of training and development to help each Individual and Team flourish. 

***The Game*** is simple: 

1. We Seek First the ***Kingdom of God*** and progress towards Unity through Love. 
2. Every individual will be responsible for forging or joining one or more self-governing, self-sustaining, and self-replicating ***Teams***. 
3. Each individual and team will ***Become*** as powerful and transformative as they can by continually tackling meaningful and aligned ***Quests*** in their zone of proximal development. 
4. We will coordinate 1/10th of our time and resources to continuously improve a ***Commons*** of shared infrastructure, resources, and support that connects and empowers the Force For Good.
5. Our aggregated stories and impact be aligned and celebrated to build the ***The Movement*** towards ***The Goal***.

The are three opening individual commitments to join: 

1. A tithe of time (nominally equivalent to 1 hour / day)   
2. A tithe of resources (monthly donation of any amount)  
3. Commitment to abide by the Spirit and Rules of The Game  

If you would like to embark with me on this profound adventure, visit www.JordanNicholas.org and [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement). 

Our Critical Path Quest for Q1 is to aggregate enough committed individuals and resources to begin. This includes securing ~$30k / month in resourcing to secure the baseline focus, administration and maintenance of the enabling Lionsberg Infrastructure.  

Proper capitalization heading into the opening quarters would be $2M to $10M in working capital, which could enter the system philanthropically or via values-aligned loans mediated by the Lionsberg 501(c)(3) non-profit.
