# Things We Should Dialogue About
A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
*April 21, 2025*

After countless tries, We recently published [[At the Crossroads - Humanity’s Final Choice]]—an attempt to invitationally express the gist of this moment in less than a three minute read.  

Contained therein is an invitation to a small group briefing and dialogue, which would expand Our engagement from ~three minutes to ~ninety minutes. 

As to the things We should dialogue about, [[144 Threads - A Desperate Prayer to Weave Humanity's Last Best Hope]] goes into more detail, while trying to keep things as short as reasonably possible. The table of contents can be scanned in ~three minutes to get a feel for the field. Most of the threads are worth at least an hour to get up to speed on. Many of them warrant teams dedicated full time to their pursuit if we want to simply survive, let alone *thrive* through [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]] ahead. 

The [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] in aggregate address the issues reasonably comprehensively. 

Unfortunately, a moment in history unlike anything in the last 10,000 years—or the next 10,000 years—cannot be adequately grappled with in a three minute note, or a ninety minute dialogue. 

It is for this reason We are so intently focused on connecting, aligning and empowering [[The First Three Percent]] of our human family by 2026. Together, 250 million strong, We have more than enough Time, Energy, Attention, and Teams to ensure that all fronts of [[The War]] succeed. 

Short of that - billions eventually die. Stark, but True.  

Love and Blessings,
