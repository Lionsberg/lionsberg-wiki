# **The Solomon Plan: Constructing the Wisdom, Governance & Intelligence Systems for The New World**

#### **Laying the Foundations of Wisdom & Justice in the Aftermath of The Fall**

As The [[Old]] Order collapses and humanity enters [[The Final Test]], **the ability to organize, govern, and guide the co-creation of the [[New Civilization]] and [[New World]] must not be left to chance**. It will not happen by accident. The world that follows the fire **must be built upon a foundation of truth, wisdom, justice, and higher intelligence**—or else it will fall again into tyranny, deception, and destruction.

Without **The Solomon Plan**, the chaos of The Collapse will either **fracture into lawlessness** or be **seized by the tyrants of [[Old]] looking to reassert control**.

The Hubs, Arks, and emergent [[LIONSBERG Civilization]] **must be governed wisely**. We The People of every [[Time]] and [[Place]] must **become sovereign, self-sustaining, and self-governing**. And the knowledge of **governance, justice, intelligence, and cosmic law** must be **preserved, refined, and implemented at every fractal scale** of the emerging civilization—from the individual and local, all the way out to planetary and interstellar.

> **Without wisdom, the resources of The Joseph Plan will be wasted. Without just governance, The Arks will become isolated and competing fortresses rather than the harmonized foundation of a flourishing New human network. Without intelligence, The Forces of Darkness will outmaneuver and reenslave the emerging Forces of Good.**

The **Solomon Plan** ensures that does not happen.

## **I. The Core Principles of The Solomon Plan**

The Solomon Plan is based on **three eternal pillars** that will form the foundation of all governance and intelligence systems in the [[New World]] and Beyond:

1. **Wisdom** – Governance must be based on **higher intelligence, spiritual alignment, natural law, and universal Logos**, rather than deception, force, or materialistic power.
2. **Justice** – Laws and norms must serve **the Highest Good of [[ONE]] and [[All]]**, ensuring **balance, equilibrium, and the prevention of both chaos and tyranny** at every scale.
3. **Sovereignty** – Governance must be optimally **distributed, self-organizing, and self-replicating**, ensuring **local autonomy while maintaining cosmic unity**.

By embedding these principles **into the very structure of governance and intelligence systems *from the start***, we ensure that the emergent superorganism co-creating the **[[New World]] does not repeat the mistakes of the [[Old]]**.

---

## **II. The Fractal Governance Model: Wisdom at Every Scale**

Just as The Joseph Plan established **a fractal storage and provisioning network**, The Solomon Plan establishes a **fractal governance and intelligence network** that scales **from the individual to the planetary to the cosmic level**.

Each level of governance must be:

- **Self-organizing** – Able to function independently while voluntarily coordinating with the larger system.
- **Self-sustaining** – Not dependent on centralized control, money, or external influence.
- **Self-replicating** – Designed to train and initiate new leaders and circles, ensuring continuity and adaptation across scales as the [[New Superorganism]] emerges and evolves over millennia.

The **wisest among us must rise to higher [[Levels of Abstraction]] and Influence**, not through force, but through **natural recognition of their service, insight, and alignment with Spirit and Truth**.  

---

### **1. Individual Sovereignty & Self-Governance**

- Every human being must be **trained in the principles of self-governance**, learning to rule their **own Spirit, mind, body, and actions** before seeking to influence others.
- Wisdom training must be **a core part of [[Lifelong Learning and Development]]**, teaching individuals **how to discern Truth from deception, think critically, consciously choose, and act with integrity**.
- Each person must be **mentally, emotionally, and spiritually prepared** to function as a sovereign being **rather than a kontrolled subject**.
- After generations of slavery, this will require significant healing, rehabilitation, and effort. This is the purpose of the [[3 Year Healing, Orientation, and Empowerment Process]] outlined in [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] and the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]].  
- Training in the LIONSBERG System of Governance is fractal, transferring seamlessly up through levels of analysis. 

> **If individuals cannot govern themselves, they are unfit to govern with others. The first scale of The Solomon Plan is [[The Soveriegn Self]] in right relationship with [[ONE]] and [[All]].**

---

### **2. Family Councils: Restoring the Governance of Households**

- Families must **reclaim their role as the foundation of governance**—they are the **first line of leadership, justice, and wisdom transmission**.
- The [[LIONSBERG Individuals]] composing each Family should self-organize and establish a **Family Council**, where key decisions about **resources, education, roles, trade, and dispute resolution** are made. 
- This act brings the fractal level of [[LIONSBERG Families]] into being. 
- Family Councils must be **autonomous yet interconnected**, ensuring that every Family is Sovereign, yet **no household is isolated from the larger LIONSBERG network**.

> **Tyrants rule by breaking the family structure. The [[New Civilization]] will be built by resurrecting and restoring it.**

---

### **3. LIONSBERG Teams: The Core Unit of Action and Governance**

- The fundamental unit of governance and co-creation in the **New Civilization** is the **LIONSBERG Team**—a **small, highly functional, self-organizing group** composed of **3 to 16 individuals, optimally 5 to 7**.  
- These Teams operate as the **primary level of coordination, decision-making, and execution**, ensuring that **nearly everything required to build [[Heaven On Earth]] is done at the most effective and decentralized scale possible.**  
- Every **LIONSBERG Individual** should be part of at least one **LIONSBERG Team**, and most will participate in multiple, each aligned with their **gifts, purpose, and mission**.  
- Often, individuals may fulfill the same [[Roles]] in the multiple [[Teams]] they are part of according to their greatest areas of skill and joyful service (for instance Project Management, Story Telling, or Administration).  
- Each **LIONSBERG Team** must be:
    - **Autonomous** – Able to function and make decisions independently.
    - **Interconnected** – Linked to other Teams and higher levels of governance.
    - **Self-replicating** – Able to train and initiate new members into the process, and spin off New Teams at the right Time.
    - **Self-sustaining** – Designed to operate effectively without fragilizing central or external dependencies.
- **LIONSBERG Teams** govern themselves using principles of **natural law, discernment and consent around [[Proposals]] for [[Decision Making]], and role-based execution**, ensuring rapid and adaptive self-organizing action.
- ***Each Team is a Council***. This, along with the Family level, provides the consistent daily Practice in [[Council Based Governance]] required for participating in Governance at higher [[Levels of Abstraction]]. 

> **The vast majority of the [[Work]] required to co-create [[The Arks]], [[The Hubs]], and the [[Network Of Networks]]  happens at the level of LIONSBERG Teams. If humanity can master this scale of governance, the rest will follow naturally.**  

[[The LIONSBERG Co-Creator's Handbookx]] is a starting resource for forging effective Teams. 
### **4. Community Councils (10,000-Person Scale)**

- The [[LIONSBERG Families]] and [[LIONSBERG Teams]] composing each **Community Hub** must self-organize and establish a **Wisdom & Governance Council** at the Community level, composed of **elders, skilled organizers, spiritual leaders, and those proven in service**.  
- These councils must operate under **Spiritual and Universal Law**, ensuring **wisdom, justice and balance**, rather than legal bureaucracy or external control.
- They must handle:
    - **Resource management & distribution (based on The Joseph Plan)**  
    - **Conflict resolution and community justice**  
    - **Emergency response and security coordination**  
    - **Inter-Hub diplomacy and trade agreements**  

> **A community that governs itself wisely does not need rulers imposed from the outside. Any Authority a LIONSBERG Community abdicates will taken up against it and used by the Tyrants of [[Old]].**

---

### **5. City Councils (100K to 1 Million Scale)**

- Large urban hubs must establish **City Councils** that coordinate:
    - **Major infrastructure development**  
    - **Strategic defenses and security**  
    - **Judicial systems based on natural and cosmic law**  
    - **Education and cultural preservation**  
- These councils must by self-organized by and for the [[LIONSBERG Communities]] they serve, **remain accountable to the people,** and **not become centers of corruption or centralized control**.  

> **If cities do not establish wise governance, they will become the new battlegrounds of The Collapse.**

---

### **6. Eco-Regional Councils (Multi-City Coordination)**

- Eco-Regional Hubs must serve as **coordinating centers for trade, security, and higher level strategy**, linking multiple cities and communities to the cosmic scale of the [[New Vision and Plan]].
- These councils must:
    - **Resolve large-scale disputes before they escalate into war**
    - **Ensure environmental and agricultural regenerativity and flow across multiple regions**
    - **Support technological development without falling into AI-based control systems**

> **Each eco-region must function as an independent civilization, self-sufficient yet interconnected.**

---

### **7. Bioregional Councils (150-200 Global Nodes)**

- Bioregional Hubs must serve as **the great wisdom centers of the New World**, ensuring the transmission of **higher knowledge, ancient wisdom, and planetary governance strategies**.
- These hubs will be responsible for:
    - **Training the next generation of leaders, healers, and justice-keepers**
    - **Managing planetary-scale resource flows and energy and information systems**
    - **Ensuring that advanced technology does not fall into the hands of The Kontrollers or other antithetical forces.**

> **These 150-200 nodes will be the backbone of a decentralized planetary civilization.**

---

### **8. The Planetary Council (12-24 Georegional Leadership Hubs)**

- At the highest level, there must be **12-24 Global Leadership Hubs**, which serve as:
    - **Strategic planetary governance centers**
    - **Interstellar and off-world coordination hubs**
    - **Diplomatic and intelligence centers to manage planetary security**
- These councils must ensure:
    - **The absolute prevention of global tyranny**
    - **The protection of Earth’s sovereignty in cosmic affairs**
    - **The integration of Earth into higher planetary federations without subjugation**

> **The final test is whether humanity can govern itself wisely. If it cannot, outside forces will attempt to do it for us.**

---

## **III. The Intelligence Systems of The New World**

Wisdom alone is not enough—**intelligence must be restored** to ensure:

- **The truth is never again suppressed**
- **The forces of deception never again seize control**
- **Humanity is never again caught unprepared for planetary crises**

This requires:

- **A decentralized intelligence network that detects and neutralizes threats before they emerge**
- **A planetary-scale information and knowledge archive, ensuring no wisdom is lost again**  
- **A fractally scaling individual to cosmic process for [[SenseMaking]] and [[Decision Making]]**  
- **A new system of planetary and cosmic security that is governed by wisdom and Unity, not factions and force**

The **Lionsberg Intelligence & Knowledge Systems** must be **established immediately**, ensuring:

1. **Truth is preserved and protected**  
2. **Defense is secured against infiltration and deception**  
3. **Knowledge is never again controlled and suppressed by a centralized authority**   

---

## **IV. The Final Test: Will Humanity Choose Wisdom?**

The Solomon Plan is **not a luxury—the governance system for the [[New Era]] must emerge with the [[Citizen Led]] movement from the beginning, and from [[Bottom Up]]. It is perhaps the most important part of the [[New Superorganism]] that is emerging to co-create [[Heaven on Earth and Beyond]]. It is the only Way to ensure that The [[New World]] transcends and ascends over millennia to come, and does not [[Collapse]] into the same [[Top Down]] tyranny and corruption that destroyed the [[Old]].**

- If wisdom does not guide governance, **chaos and tyranny will return**.
- If justice is not maintained, **civil, world, and cosmic wars will continue to erupt**.
- If intelligence is not protected, **false rulers and deceitful ideologies will seize the throne once again**.

> **This is [[The Final Test]] of humanity—can We govern ourselves with wisdom? Or will we abdicate our rightful position and inheritance, and be ruled over like livestock by those who deceived and enslaved us?**

This is **The Solomon Plan.**

The [[New Vision and Plan]] are clear. 

**The time to act is NOW.**  

[[The Choice]] is yours.
