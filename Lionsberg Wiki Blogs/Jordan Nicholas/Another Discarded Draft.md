# Another Discarded Draft

**Dear Loved Ones and Allies,**

I recently wrote another 14,000 inadequate words, and asked AI what the essence was in 100 bullets. 

I would not have said it exactly like this, but it is approximately True: 

### **Personal Experience and Warning**

1. I love you, and I miss you.
2. The last five years have been a crucible of loss, suffering, and war.
3. Everything I built—home, resources, reputation—was stripped away.
4. This was not random misfortune, but an attack by a malevolent force.
5. What I have seen and experienced cannot be ignored.
6. Returning to "normal" is no longer an option.
7. I am writing because our lives—yours, mine, and countless others—are in grave danger.
8. If we do not change something, my body may not survive, and my loved ones will suffer.
9. The war I have fought is not only financial or legal—it is spiritual and existential.
10. It is a war against a force that is **not merely human**.

### **A Global Crisis**

11. This force is moving toward every doorstep and community on Earth.
12. Its goal is **Full Spectrum Dominance** of humanity and beyond.
13. This is not speculation—it is supported by countless witnesses and historical records.
14. Institutions—government, religion, media—are complicit in keeping this hidden.
15. For generations, humanity has been enslaved by deception.
16. A shadow government has been in contact with advanced **Non-Human Intelligences (NHIs)**.
17. Their agenda includes genetic manipulation, abductions, and total control.
18. The timeline of their plan peaks between 2027-2030.
19. If true, billions will suffer and die in the coming years.
20. The final battle for the soul of humanity has already begun.

### **A Line in the Sand**

21. You have a choice: investigate and act, or turn away and hope for the best.
22. If this is real, by the time it reaches your door, it will be too late.
23. The institutions you trust—government, media, academia—are controlled by it.
24. Many who spoke out before have been silenced, ridiculed, or killed.
25. The consequences of ignoring this are too severe to risk disbelief.
26. I am risking everything to tell you this.
27. I do not ask for trust lightly—I have built my life on integrity and truth.
28. If you doubt me, research the evidence yourself.
29. Dismissing this as paranoia is the luxury of those who have not seen what I have.
30. The question is not **if** this is real, but **what will you do about it?**
