A post in [[Above The Chaos]].

The vision of the New World is universal and eternal. It is not the vision of any one person, but the vision of what is possible when One and All rightly relate to one another according to the Logos of the universe.

While some can see it more clearly than others, the Vision is One. The Vision has been spoken by the prophets of the Old Testament. It is been spoken by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It has been spoken by Jesus. It has been spoken by Gandhi. It has been spoken by Muhammed.  It has been spoken by Desmond Tutu. It has been spoken by Mother Theresa. It has been spoken by every prophetic voice who has cried out for truth, love and justice to reign on earth. There is only One thing to speak, and it is what we are attempting to speak into reality as well.

It is the Vision of the New World. It is the Vision of the World to Come. It is the Vision of the Kingdom of God, on earth as it is in heaven. It is the Vision of a fully regenerated and renewed world that is already perfect, and yet continues to get better day as One and All labor together in harmony to make it so. It is a Vision of harmony. It is a Vision of symphony. It is a Vision of perfection. It is a Vision of Truth. It is a Vision of Love. It is a vision of Justice. It is a Vison of One and All.

Deep within us, we all have a dream of the New World. We can all sense it. We can all feel it when it is spoken.  All creation longs for it. It is the highest intention and greatest good of which can conceive. To speak in religious terms, it is the will and intention of God, fully manifest on earth as it is in heaven. To speak in architectural terms, it is a pattern language that brings all elements of the universe into perfect harony with one another so that we experience perfect peace and coherence. To speak in musical terms, it is the patterns of the universal symphony, ringing forth from every mountain, valley, ocean, river and plain. It is the sound of perfect harmony. It is the sight of perfect coherence. It is the experience of perfect love. It is the presence of perfect justice. It is the eternal and universal song of the logos that brings forth out of chaos and infinite potential the new order is most good.

We can all see, sense, feel, hear, and experience glimpses of the Vision.

Glimpses of a world where the skies are clear, the air is clean, the water is pure, and the soil flourishes with life. It is a world where plants, animals, people, and ecosystems thrive in harmony. It is a world where every person has access to everything they need for wellbeing and happiness. It is a world where everyone has an abundance of food, water, shelter, and security. It is a world where every child has the opportunity to receive wisdom, knowledge and support as they develop towards their full potential. It is a world where people of every tribe and nation live in peace and harmony with one another. It is a world where we all belong. It is a world where the natural environment is protected, respected, and renewed, and where all elements are used regeneratively for the benefit of all.

In this world, every person is valued and respected for who they are. Each person is treated as if there is something of the divine within them, because all have come to know that as true. There is no discrimination or prejudice. There is no injustice or oppression. Everyone is treated with dignity and compassion. Every person has the right to live their life to the fullest and to pursue their own happiness and development by helping all others pursue their own happiness and development.

The New World is a place where all power and authority on earth have been transformed, and each individual and locality is the responsible agent in charge of their own destiny. We have the power to make the decisions that affect our lives and their communities, and to do what we know to be right, wise and good in our own time and space. We are connected, we are empowering one another, we are working together, we are helping one another, we are meeting one another's needs, we are solving problems, we are progressing towards The Goal and working in harmony to create a better future for All.

The New World is a place where the economy is just, where poverty and privation have been vanquished, and where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive. It is a place where all citizens and localities govern themselves, so that they are not governed by others. It is a place of transparency, accountability, wisdom, and respect.

The New World is a place where love, compassion, and justice for all are the guiding principles. It is a place where the wisdom and principles of people like Jesus and the prophets are followed, and where the will and intention of God is fully manifest on earth as it is in heaven. It is a place where all people and all of creation can flourish in harmony with one another and the mystery of That Which Is Creating And Sustaining All Things.

The New World is a place where we are no longer separated from resources and power by rulers and oligarchies, and where we are no longer separated from God by priests. The New World is one where the veils and boundaries have been torn, and every being flourishes in direct right relationship with the Source of all power, authority, and creativity. It is a place where the knowledge and wisdom of God covers the earth like floodwaters, because it is written in our spirits, hearts, and minds. It is a place where we are liberated from oppressive laws and bureaucracies, because all things govern themselves by the highest unwritten universal and eternal law.

Imagine a world where truth, love, justice, wisdom, and stewardship cover the earth like floodwaters, ushering in a new era of harmony, prosperity, and right relationship between One and All.

Imagine a world where all people have access to the resources and opportunities they need to develop towards the fullness of their unique potential and thrive.

Imagine a world where communities are resilient, self-sufficient, and self-governing, and they work together to solve problems and create opportunities in new and creative ways.

Imagine a world where the environment is being fully regenerated, nurtured, and renewed.

Imagine a world where people of all religions, cultures, and backgrounds live in peace and mutual respect, and everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the progress and harmony of society. The economy is fair and just, and everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to achieve their full potential.

In this New World, there is no room for poverty, hunger, discrimination, or injustice. Everyone has access to quality lifelong education, healthcare, and housing. Families are strong and supportive, children are loved and nurtured, and the elderly and disabled are respected and cared for. In this world, rights and benefits accrue first to the weakest and most vulnerable. In this world, the strong serve and empower the weak. The naked are clothed. The hungry are fed. The thirsty are given drink. The houseless dwell in homes. The immigrants and refugees are welcomed and embraced. The downtrodden are lifted up. The prisoners and slaves are liberated and become free.

The New World is one where love, compassion and justice define life and society, from highest level concept, to lowest level detail. There are at the forefront of every system, every decision, and every action. It is a world where people are guided by principles of truth, love, justice, stewardship and wisdom, as they strive to live in harmony with one another and the planet. It is a world where the power of the Spirit of Love that longs to lift up, empower, and help all creation flourish in harmony with its Source, is at the center of everything, animating everything, inspiring everything, impelling everything, as all things help one another progress towards The Goal.

We pray, with all creation and every ounce of our being, that this heaven would come to earth. We pray, with all creation and every ounce of our being, “Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” And while we pray, we do not wait. We turn around and Act As If we were builders whose job, having understood the will and intention of the Supreme Architect, was to bring it into reality. We Act As If we were invited to become co-workers with one another and God, and therefore co-workers with all creation, to elevate and transform our lives and our world towards the perfect will and intention of the One from who we All arise, through whom we All are sustained, and to whom we All return. We Act As If we were a part of One and All, who were not destined to suffer forever under injustice and tyranny, but who were destined to break every yoke of oppression, to rip every chain from the wall, and to experience the fullness and joy that we created for, and are indeed destined for.

This is the world we are working together towards, and we invite you to join us in co-creating it.
