The roots of this philosophy and system of [[Kontrolle]] trace back much further than the 20th century. They are easily traced through World War I, the American Civil and Revolutionary Wars, the architectural layout of Washington D.C., and into the preceding colonial and imperial systems that enslaved and erased cultures and peoples worldwide under the banner of "God and King." Even deeper, they extend into the ancient systems of Rome, Babylon, Sumer, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 

In each place, the elders of nearly every culture tell the same True story, so cruelly disregarded by modern brainwashed minds as myth: 

- **“Temple-Kingship descended to Earth from above.”** Or alternately, arose from below.   
- Lowercase "gods" divided the Earth and walked upon it, ruling over humanity like masters over livestock, demanding ritual sacrifice of animals, women, and children.    
- Pyramids, temples, priests, and money consolidated the system of kontrolle. 
- Wars among these false gods and the tribes they dominated destroyed cities and civilizations, leaving a legacy of division, exploitation, and domination.  
- Genetic engineering, hybridization, and interbreeding produced chimeras, giants, hybrids, and select bloodlines, establishing the "royalty" that would dominate human history for millennia. 

These are not myths. They are the surviving remnants of Our fragmented histories, revealing an ancient system of domination, division, and kontrolle that remains active today, manipulating our institutions and obscuring the truth of humanity’s origins, potential, and destiny. 

The men and women abducted and raped by these entities, the sangomas who recover bodies from crashed crafts and eat them, and the soldiers who encounter them underwater, underground, and in the sky, will tell you that their bodies, flesh, and craft are as real as you and I. No matter what lengths they go to remain hidden in the shadows.
