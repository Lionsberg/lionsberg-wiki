As we examine the [[New Pattern Language]], it is evident that bioregions, watersheds, and ancestral tribal lands will play a significant roles. 

A non-profit out of Canada has put together a good head start on mapping tribal lands on a couple continents:

Our friend Justin Winters and the allies at One Earth have put years into mapping the [[Bioregions]] and [[Ecoregions]]...

- These maps will help form the basis for the layout of [[Bioregional Hubs]] and [[Ecoregional Hubs]]   

If you are aware of any other key resources, please reach out and we will work together to synergize the maps and mappers.
