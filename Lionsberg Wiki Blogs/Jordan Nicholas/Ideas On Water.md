# Ideas On Water 
A Post in [[Above The Chaos]]  
*June 25, 2025*  

We are being quoted ~$15k to $20k to drill wells in rural East Africa.  
We wonder how we might be able to empower communities for 1/10th of that. 

The research begins. 

**1. Manual (Baptist‚Äëstyle) Borehole Drilling + Hand Pump**

‚Ä¢ A manual ‚ÄúBaptist drilling rig‚Äù can be constructed locally for around‚ÄØ$150 (2006 prices) plus PVC casing and pump components (~$2 per metre) .

‚Ä¢ With this method, communities can drill down **up to ~30‚ÄØm** (even 100+‚ÄØm in ideal cases) using basic tools and labor .

‚Ä¢ Installing a **community hand‚Äëpump** (e.g., Afridev) allows sustainable access to deeper, typically safer groundwater, with simple maintenance .

Takeaway - It seems there is a big market gap for an open-source drilling machine design / kit that scales through a few pricepoints... 

- Sub $200 DIY Baptist Well Kit 
- Sub $1,000 step up 
- Sub $3k to $5k portable mechanical machine  
- Sub $10k simpler version of higher end concepts  

J's intuition is that highly effective machines could be manufactured out of available materials in developing countries for under $10k. 
The Village Drill is an interesting step conceptually, but still expensive for mass-roll-out and adoption.  

## Ideas 

- Well Drilling "Soft Franchise"... drill, and train drilling teams... 
	- Continuously improving set of equipment, training, process, etc.
