As we assemble The Movement and look ahead towards The Future We Seek, it is self-evident that we must regenerate and refound the decaying political, social, and natural systems in 200 nation states and thousands of localities relatively simultaneously during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. This will need to be done from the [[Bottom Up]], by the Citizens of each Domain, as One Body. 

One of the most significant risks and opportunities across the geopolitical landscape is the United States, which will host a pivotal election in 2024. 

While we anticipate that the legislatures will be largely dominated by the corrupt political parties puppetted by the [[Invisible Power Structures]], we believe it is both possible and necessary to target the Executive branch across the nation in 2024, beginning with the US President, 11 governors, and dozens of mayors being elected in 2024. Gubernatorial elections are being held in the following states: 

- Delaware  
- Indiana 
- Missouri  
- Montana  
- New Hampshire  
- North Carolina  
- North Dakota  
- Utah  
- Vermont  
- Washington  
- West Virginia 

The strategy that we are evaluating involves building a Vision and Values based movement fast enough to be able to essentially write in any candidate to the White House we choose while dealing with the complexities of the electoral college, and running front and back end Citizen Led blockchain-based checks on election integrity. 

The US President, in concert with a coalition of governors, mayors, and a wise administration, would wield significant influence to begin addressing the issues plaguing the nation, repairing its Foundations, and placing the might of the United States back in service of its citizens and the world, while inviting other resonant tribes and nations to join [[The Lionsberg Alliance]]. 

This strategy would be coupled to building a functional executive team / cabinet to begin actively serving The Movement in advance of the election, such that the public could choose to vote for a comprehensive [[New Vision and Plan]] founded on universal and eternal Wisdom, Principles, Values, coupled with an entire functioning slate of leaders, governors, and mayors capable of working together towards the [[Progressive Realization]] of [[The Goal]]. 

In advance of the ability to implement the necessary [[Constitutional Amendments]] to fundamentally refound and reset the American Experiment, our Aim is to support as many local vision-and-values-aligned mayors and leaders as possible as part of [[The First Three Percent]], who would be connected, equipped, and supported in their efforts to exercise the existing levers of local government to engage a renaissance of transformational local Civic Engagement. 

If this opening milestone is successful, by 2026 we should be able to collectively make the remaining governance changes required to make available the mechanism of [[Constitutional Amendments]], opening the opportunity to fundamentally reset, refound, and realign the American Experiment and reestablish a [[Properly Ordered]] Society, [[New Covenant]], and [[New Alliance]] that can endure through the coming millennia. 

We are working to identify other qualified independent candidates to run alongside Jordan for US President, while connecting with the wisest and most resonant existing governors and gubernatorial and mayoral candidates to forge [[The Grand Collaboration]] required.
