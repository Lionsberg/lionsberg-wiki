As we assemble The Movement and look ahead towards The Future We Seek, it is self-evident that we must address and in many cases transform and refound the decaying political systems in 200 nation states and thousands of localities relatively simultaneously over the next 10 years. This will need to be done from the bottom up, by the Citizens of each Domain. 

One of the most significant risks and opportunities across the geopolitical landscape is the United States, which will host a pivotal election in 2024. 

While we anticipate that the legislatures will be largely dominated by the corrupt political parties puppetted by the [[Invisible Power Structures]], we believe it is possible to target the Executive branch across the nation in 2024, beginning with the US President and 11 governors being elected in 2024. Gubernatorial elections are being held in the following states: 

- Delaware  
- Indiana 
- Missouri  
- Montana  
- New Hampshire  
- North Carolina  
- North Dakota  
- Utah  
- Vermont  
- Washington  
- West Virginia 

The strategy that we are evaluating involves building a movement fast enough to be able to essentially write in any candidate to the White House we choose while dealing with the complexities of the electoral college, and running front and back end Citizen Led blockchain-based checks on election integrity. 

The US President, in concert with a coalition of governors and a wise administration, would wield significant influence to begin addressing the issues plaguing the nation. 

If this opening milestone is successful, by no later than 2026 we should be able to make the remaining changes required to make available to us the mechanism of constitutional amendment, opening the opportunity to fundamentally reset, refound, and realign the American Experiment by massively shrinking the federal government and relocalizing responsibility and authority to states and localities.
