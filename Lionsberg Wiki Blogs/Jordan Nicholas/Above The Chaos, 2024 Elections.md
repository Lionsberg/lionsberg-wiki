# Above The Chaos, 2024 Election Strategy

As we assemble The Movement and look ahead towards The Future We Seek, it is self-evident that we must regenerate and refound the decaying political, social, and natural systems in 200 nation states and thousands of localities relatively simultaneously during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. This will need to be done from the bottom up, by the Citizens of each Domain, as One Body. 

One of the most significant risks and opportunities across the geopolitical landscape is the United States, which will host a pivotal election in 2024. 

While we anticipate that the legislatures will be largely dominated by the corrupt political parties puppetted by the [[Invisible Power Structures]], we believe it is both possible and necessary to target the Executive branch across the nation in 2024, beginning with the US President and 11 governors being elected in 2024. Gubernatorial elections are being held in the following states: 

- Delaware  
- Indiana 
- Missouri  
- Montana  
- New Hampshire  
- North Carolina  
- North Dakota  
- Utah  
- Vermont  
- Washington  
- West Virginia 

The strategy that we are evaluating involves building a Vision and Values based movement fast enough to be able to essentially write in any candidate to the White House we choose while dealing with the complexities of the electoral college, and running front and back end Citizen Led blockchain-based checks on election integrity. 

The US President, in concert with a coalition of governors and a wise administration, would wield significant influence to begin addressing the issues plaguing the nation, repairing its Foundations, and placing the might of the United States back in service of its citizens and the world. 

This strategy would be coupled to building a functional executive team / cabinet to begin actively serving The Movement in advance of the election, such that the public could choose to vote for a comprehensive [[New Vision and Plan]] founded on universal and eternal Wisdom, Principles, Values, coupled with an entire functioning slate of leaders and governors capable of working together towards the [[Progressive Realization]] of [[The Goal]]. 

If this opening milestone is successful, by no later than 2026 we should be able to make the remaining governance changes required to make available the mechanism of constitutional amendment, opening the opportunity to fundamentally reset, refound, and realign the American Experiment and reestablish a [[Properly Ordered]] Society that can endure through the coming millennia. 

We are working to identify other qualified independent candidates to run alongside Jordan for US President, while connecting with the wisest and most resonant existing governors and gubernatorial candidates to forge the Grand Collaboration required.
