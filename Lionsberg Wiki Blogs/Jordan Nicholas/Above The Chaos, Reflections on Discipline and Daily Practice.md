# Above The Chaos, Reflections on Discipline and Daily Practice

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.01.30 _(updated 2024.01.30)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

There is an amazing [[Paradox]] between [[Discipline]] and [[Freedom]]. 

In the [[Archetypical Narrative Structure]] of existence, they can be thought of in terms of shades of [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]], [[Yang]] and [[Yin]]. 

In the realm of [[Freedom]], there is found at its extreme pure unstructured [[Potential]]. Absolute and Unconditional Love and Acceptance for [[What Is]] and [[What Is Trying To Emerge]]. It tends towards the pole of [[Chaos]]. 

In the realm of [[Discipline]], there is found at its extreme a pure structured rigidity of [[Purpose]], [[Intention]], and [[Goal]]. Striving beyond [[What Is]] towards [[What Should Be]]. It is on tends towards the pole of [[Order]]. 

As in all [[Apparent Polarities]], there exists a [[Higher Perspective]] that properly integrates and orders them both, in right [[Balance]] and [[Proportion]], within itself. From this [[Highest Perspective]], Discipline is an aspect of Freedom, Freedom is an aspect of Discipline, and both are an aspect of and unified by the [[Spirit]] of the [[ONE]]. 

The [[Way]], always and eternally, is mediated by the [[Spirit]] that enables us to [[Walk The Line]] between opposing forces towards [[Heaven]], while avoiding the [[Hell]] that lies in an excess of deviation off the Path in any direction.

In 2022 and 2023, I manifested an imbalance of Freedom at the expense of Discipline as I grappled with the pain, healing, and redemptive goodness of our descent through the Underworld and reemergence. 

In 2024, my Intention is to manifest a greater degree of Discipline, Structure, Order and [[Daily Practice]] to anchor individual and collective [[Progress]] in the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

While continuing to do my best to consciously [[Walk The Line]] without swinging towards an excess of [[Order]].
