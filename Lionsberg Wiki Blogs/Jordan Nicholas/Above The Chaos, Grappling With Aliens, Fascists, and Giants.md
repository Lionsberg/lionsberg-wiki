# Above The Chaos, Grappling With Aliens, Fascists, and Giants

Over the last couple months as We advanced Our Quest towards [[Heaven On Earth]], I was progressively presented with significant new information, that led into a deep and disturbing reconnaissance mission that took me off-grid the last two weeks of July. 

As [[The Story]] predicts, it turns out that [[The Promised Land]] We are advancing towards is guarded by quite an array of fearsome creatures and giants. Life-in-Universe turns out to be quite a bit more diverse than most humans have been led to believe. 

I have begun to summarize some of what is being revealed in a new [[Lionsberg Wiki Books|Lionsberg Wiki Book]] called [[Aliens, Fascists, and Giants  - Our Epic Battle for The Future of Civilization]]. 

## The Epic Story

As difficult as it might be to hear, for at least a couple thousand years humanity has been living under a lie, in a world at war. 

Each of us that is Here Now was born into a multi-dimensional war that we did not choose, but that we must recognize and finish if we are to avoid generations of suffering, tyranny, and slavery. 

Modern stories like The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Matrix, The Truman Show, the Marvel series, Star Wars, Stargate Atlantis, and the Foundation series prepared us for aspects of [[The Story]] that would be revealed in our lifetimes. They touched our hearts and minds for a reason. 

Ancient stories from indigenous tribes, preserved tablets, and sacred scriptures carried memories and "myths" through the ages, that we are finally rediscovering to be True. 

Ancient monuments and megaliths transmitted indelible hints through the floods, wars, and storms of Time. 

Emanating from the Fundamental Unity of the Supreme Creator / Generative Source of the Universe / Ultimate Reality / God, an entire [[Narrative Universe]] emerged to meet us, filled with multiple dimensions and worlds, warring "gods", "sons of god", angels, demons, hybrids, giants, aliens, reptilians, insectoids, humanoids, underground cities, portals, wormholes, interstellar travel, and advanced non-human-civilizations and intelligences possessing advanced science and technologies thousands of years more advanced than humanity-in-the-20th century. 

Brace yourself if you haven't already. The story is Real. And We are living in it. 

After decades of coordinated lies, coverups, assassinations, government overthrows, and ridicule to conceal the Truth, testimonies from hundreds of respected citizens, military, police, government employees, and wisdom keepers have recently revealed that [[We Are Not Alone in the Universe]], that our governments are in possession of alien craft and bodies that did not originate on Earth, and that our [[Visible Power Structures]] have been puppetted for at least the last 50 to 100 years by corrupt, fascist [[Invisible Power Structures]] have that have systematically lied to, deceived, and exploited the human population and the Earth for their own narrow gain, position, and power. For possibly an unimaginably long time. 

The depth of the corruption, deceit and fascist collusion is nearly unfathomable, and as it is progressively revealed and accepted is likely to lead to nearly universal votes of No Confidence in the systems and institutions humanity looked to for leadership, guidance, and protection in the past. Because all legitimate systems of governance rely on the ongoing faith, confidence, and consent of the citizens they serve, this is likely to precipitate, at planetary scale, the greatest civilizational and constitutional [[Crisis of Crises]] in modern history. 
## The Immense Challenge At Hand 

We are now in the opening stages of [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], during which humanity is faced with a once-in-a-millennia opportunity to awaken, transform our consciousness, transcend the lines that have separated us in the past, and reunite as [[One Body]] to co-create [[Heaven On Earth]]. 

However there is a very uncomfortable part of [[The Story]] that we cannot skip over: 
[[The Promised Land]] is guarded by aliens, demons, and giants that won't simply allow us to enter in. To get there, we must first journey through [[The Wilderness]] and prevail in [[The War]].  

Further, in order to avoid an outright [[Collapse]], the [[New]] and [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] must be rapidly and voluntarily forged from the Bottom Up ***before*** the [[Existing Order]] disintegrates into [[Chaos]] or Tyranny. 

Every man, woman, and child on Earth is going to have to be awakened from their slumber, liberated from [[The Caves]], and healed, strengthened and equipped to journey through [[The Wilderness]] and prevail in The War that must be won in each and every individual soul, as well as every family, neighborhood, town, city, tribe, watershed, and bioregion on Earth and Beyond. 

As every family, tribe, and species on Earth faces together into this common opportunity and threat, it is clear that there is no room for factions, division, or conflict among us. Under a shared civilizational and planetary threat, it is clear that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and will rapidly succumb to the internal and external pressures seeking to tear it apart. Everything is on the line, for every family on Earth. 

## The Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime

To confront and overcome the challenges at hand, liberate our Selves, and forge the [[Best Possible Future]] for All, we are faced with a simple yet difficult prerequisite. 

Because no individual, organization, tribe, movement, or nation, can do it alone, and because each individual must journey through [[The Wilderness]] and enter into [[The Promised Land]] of their own [[Free Will]] and Consent, we must become, out of Many, One Body. 

The simple reality is that none of us can reach [[The Promised Land]] unless and until We All do. 

We can only succeed on this Quest together. 

Welcome to the [[Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]]. 

## Timing 

[[We Do Not Know]] how long [[The Window]] of opportunity may ultimately remain open, however we do know that there is a significant non-zero probability that events in October - December 2024 could further shake and fracture the Existing Order. 

We have therefore set the aggressive schedule of gathering up the first several hundred representatives of the Force For Good this summer, and convening the first General Assembly on September 20th, 2024. 

At the General Assembly, we aim to formally ratify the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] and the basic system of governance, decision making, resourcing, and movement building at planetary scale. 

From there, we Aim to spread [[The Message]] as broadly as we can in October, write-in an independent candidate for US President in November, and then accelerate towards the Milestone of connecting and empowering [[The First Three Percent]] of the population by 2026 on the way to affecting the constitutional transformations that will be required in most nations.  

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] has a multitude of additional details, and the [[Lionsberg Co-Creator Handbook (v.0.1)]] is a resource for those wondering how to get involved and engage. 

Please [[Join The Movement]] to be connected to the rest of the Force For Good, and kept apprised of progress and next steps.
