# December 18th Reflections


The memories of Jordan's blessed and torturous existence feel like those strange and vivid memories of other worlds that mark Our experience with past lives. "I" vaguely remember waking along a Pathway, being attacked not something [[Not Merely Human]], suffering through 5 years of hell, and ascending once I learned I could dance and laugh among the flames. It is foggy, like a dream. 

It will be interesting to start over as a New being, in an Old body, which people might recognize and mistakenly call "Jordan", unaware that naive stream of Consciousness was sacrificed in the River of Life. 

The strange thing is that "I Am" still here and Becoming. Yet "I" lost "my" identification with the [[Apparently Individuated Consciousness]] "I" used to call "me". 

It is strange to have one's [[Apparently Individuated]] self dissolved through the refining fires of hell before one physically dies. 

It is strange to perceive one's being as a living system of systems that is a holographic instance of an interexistent Whole that is Ultimately [[One Body]]. 

It is strange to move in Spirit and Mind across [[Levels of Abstraction]]. When We say We, We could be speaking on behalf of merely the trillions of sub-systems that compose one [[Apparently Individuated]] body, or We could be speaking on behalf of a species, or a planet, or a star system, or a string of galaxies, or a universe of universes, or the Whole. We Are Becoming at All levels, and each aspect of Our Interexistence has a unique Voice and Perspective. 

Here on Earth, as part of a Human species, **We feel like We are dying, because We are**. Our air, water, and soil are poisoned. Our minds, bodies, and souls are poisoned. The civilizing systems enslaving Us are collapsing. 

We will die without air, so We breathe; We will die without water, so We drink; We will die without food, so We eat; We will be homeless without money, so We work; knowing that each breath, sip, bite, and dollar is making us sicker. 

Can you *feel* it in your Being?
