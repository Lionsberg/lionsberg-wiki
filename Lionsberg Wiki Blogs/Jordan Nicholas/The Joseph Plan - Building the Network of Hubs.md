# **The Joseph Plan: Building the Network of Hubs**

#### **Preparing the Storehouses for the Coming Famine**

As [[The Collapse]] accelerates and the Cleansing by Fire approaches, **humanity must immediately shift beyond survivalist thinking and toward proactive, coordinated, large-scale provisioning**—not just for ourselves, but for our families, communities, and the planetary network that will endure beyond [[The Storm]].

The Joseph Plan is the **fractal storage, resource, and supply Commons** that must be established **at every level of analysis**, ensuring that no one Family or Ark stands alone, and that the survivors of the transition have what they need to rebuild a [[New Civilization]] worthy of The [[New World]].

Much like the Biblical Joseph, who foresaw **seven years of famine** and wisely stored grain to sustain The People, We must **prepare now**, while there is still [[Time]].

And [[The Window]] is closing fast. 

The **Hubs** are the networked and interoperable **supply and provisioning centers** that will sustain:

- **The Arks** – Ensuring the survival of individuals, families, and localized sanctuaries.
- **The Human Network** – Facilitating the flow of resources and information to sustain civilization through [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]].
- **The Future of Humanity** – Preserving essential knowledge, tools, genetics, and materials for the [[World To Come]]. 

Without The Hubs, **The Arks will not last long enough to plant the seeds of The New World.**

The time to build is **Now**.

## **I. The Fractal Hub Network: The Storage and Supply Grid**

The Hubs must be **designed fractally**, meaning that at **each scale of civilization**, there is a structured, self-replicating, decentralized storage and supply system.

Each level must be **autonomous but interconnected**, ensuring **resilience, redundancy, and interoperability** so that no single breakdown can bring down the surrounding system elements.

---

### **1. Family Hubs: The Foundation of Survival**

- **Every family must have its own storehouse**—a **micro-hub** of essential provisions to ensure basic survival.
- This includes:
    - **Long-term food and water storage**
    - **Medical supplies, tools, and energy solutions**
    - **Seed banks and essential knowledge archives**
    - **Basic self-defense and security measures**
- These Hubs **must be designed to last 7-10 years**, ensuring continuity beyond the initial shock of The Collapse.
- Family hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Individuals]] they serve.

> **The first layer of The Joseph Plan is the family storehouse—without it, survival is left to chance.**

***But no family can survive alone, and if families hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

---

### **2. Local Micro-Hubs: Scattered Caches & Redundancy**

- In addition to home storage, **small-scale hidden, secure supply caches** must be **scattered in strategic locations**.
- These serve as **fallback points for local communities if homes or Arks are compromised** and include:
    - **Hidden food and water depots**
    - **Emergency medical kits**
    - **Solar chargers and off-grid power sources**
    - **Backup digital and hardcopy knowledge archives**
- These caches must be **discreetly placed and known only to trusted local network members**.
- Micro hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Families]] they serve.

> **If a single point of failure can wipe out an entire supply chain, the system is too fragile. The Hubs ensure continuity under all conditions.**

---

### **3. Community Hubs: The 10,000-Person Scale**

- Every town, rural community, or neighborhood must **develop a local Hub (can be multiple networked locations)** that serves as:
    - **A food storage and distribution center**  
    - **A medical and healing facility**  
    - **A repair and manufacturing site**  
    - **A crisis coordination and intelligence node**  
    - **A Commons housing the more expensive tools, solutions, and equipment that empower various local functions (for example regenerative food production, 3D printing, etc.)**  
- For speed of deployment, these Hubs should be **built into existing structures where possible**, such as:
    - **Churches, temples, and spiritual centers**
    - **Libraries and knowledge repositories**
    - **Homesteads, co-ops, and farm-based collectives**
- The goal is to ensure that **entire communities are not left vulnerable to the collapse of centralized systems**.
- While utilizing existing facilities for speed of deployment, The Commons housing key resources should be graduating moved to The Arks or other secure locations as they become available. 
- ***DO NOT WAIT FOR THE ARKS TO BE COMPLETED TO BEGIN CO-OPERATING THE COMMUNITY HUBS***. 
- Practice makes perfect, and the Hubs should begin co-operating *immediately* so that the [[New System]] begins organically emerging in response to needs. 
- Community hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Families]] they serve.

> **A lone wolf may manage to survive alone—but a networked community thrives.**

***No Community can survive alone, and if Communities hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

---

### **4. City Hubs: Serving 100K to 1 Million**

- These Hubs must be **strategically placed near or within urban areas**, designed to **sustain large populations** as supply chains disintegrate.
- Their focus is on:
    - **Bulk food storage and distribution networks**
    - **Water purification and independent power generation**
    - **Urban farming and high-density food production rollouts**
    - **Security operations to defend against looters and chaos**  
    - Providing a Commons of more costly tools, technologies, and solutions that are impractical to recreate at the 10,000 member community level. 
- **Underground storage, repurposed warehouses, and fortified locations are ideal.**  
- City hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Communities]] they serve, and ***not the municipal / Old governments of the Collapsing [[Existing Order]].***

> **If cities do not establish independent Hubs, they will become death zones within weeks of collapse.**

***No city can survive alone, and if cities hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

---

### **5. Eco-Regional Hubs: Serving Multiple Cities**

- These Hubs serve as **regional supply and coordination centers**, ensuring that **multiple cities and towns remain interconnected**.
- They function as:
    - **Logistical command centers for resource allocation**   
    - **Larger scale recycling and redistribution centers**  
    - **Emergency relief distribution points**  
    - **Inter-city trade and barter coordination zones**  
    - **Production centers for essential tools, fuel, and survival goods**  
    - **A Commons of more costly tools, technologies, and solutions that are impractical to recreate at the city level.** 
- These Hubs must be positioned in **strategic locations with strong natural resource access**, such as:
    - **Fertile agricultural regions**  
    - **Near clean water sources**  
    - **In areas with favorable [[Resilience Factors]]**    
- Ecoregional hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Cities]] they serve, and ***not the municipal / Old governments of the Collapsing [[Existing Order]].***


> **A city without a supply line is a city of the dead. Eco-Regional Hubs ensure the arteries of civilization remain open.**

***No ecoregion can survive alone, and if ecoregions hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

---

### **6. Bioregional Hubs: The 150-200 Core Nodes**

- These Hubs serve as **the backbone of the New decentralized civilization**, ensuring that every major bioregion of Earth has:
    - **Sustainable food, water, and energy production capacity**
    - **large-scale medical  manufacturing and health services**  
    - **Knowledge storage, education centers, and training facilities**  
    - **Globally interoperable manufacturing, transportation and logistics capacity**  
    - **Cultural and spiritual preservation sites**
- They act as **large-scale trade and knowledge centers**, ensuring that:
    - **The skills and wisdom of one region can benefit all others**
    - **Surplus resources can be redistributed as needed**
    - **A new planetary operating system can emerge, independent of the Old World’s control**
- Bioregional hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Ecoregions]] they serve, and ***not the Old governments of the Collapsing [[Existing Order]].***

> **These 150-200 Hubs are the foundation of post-collapse civilization. They must be prepared before the Collapse, not after.**

***No bioregion can survive alone, and if bioregions hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

---

### **7. Georegional Hubs: The 12-24 Global Power Centers**

- At the highest level, there must be **12-24 strategic planetary-scale Hubs**, acting as:
    - **Centers of advanced technology development**
    - **Spacefaring and off-world expansion points**
    - **Major industrial and scientific hubs for rebuilding civilization**
    - **Centers of decentralized governance, ensuring no return to tyranny**
- These must be **shielded from AI control systems and structured to resist infiltration**.  
- They will serve as **the last line of planetary civilization before humanity’s next expansion phase**.  
- Georegional hubs must be governed by the [[LIONSBERG Bioregions]] they serve, and ***not the Old governments of the Collapsing [[Existing Order]].***

> **These Hubs ensure that we do not merely survive—we consciously evolve Together into the [[New Era]].**

***No georegion can survive alone, and if georegions hoard, they will accelerate [[Collapse]] and billions will die.***

## **II. Storing Up for the 7 Years: Executing The Joseph Plan**

If The Hubs are to function, **they must be provisioned in advance**.

Each level of The Hub Network must:

1. **Ramp up local production and stockpile essential food, water, medicine, and tools before supply chains collapse.**
	1. Each locality accelerating local production and becoming a [[Centers of Distribution|Center of Distribution]] rather than accumulation / hoarding is key to avoiding accelerating [[Collapse]]. 
2. **Build parallel economic and governance systems to replace the failing centralized model.**
	1. The LIONSBERG System was purpose-built for this. 
3. **Develop rapid-response teams to protect supply chains and distribution networks, and respond to emergencies.**  
4. **Establish underground, off-grid, and mobile storage for extreme scenarios.**  
5. **Use The LIONSBERG Platform and Pattern Language to ensure interoperability and mutual assistance across all scales.**

***The key to success is to rapidly connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]] at every fractal level to self-organize and execute this plan via [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams coordinating across local, regional, and planetary scales via the LIONSBERG System.** 

> **If we do not store up now, millions will perish when the famine arrives.**

---

## **III. The Last Warning: There Will Be No Second Chance**

The Kontrollers have already built **their own Hubs**—designed to serve only the elites while the rest of humanity suffers.

If We do not build **Our Own**, we will be at **their mercy.**

> **Joseph saved his people by storing up for the famine. Those who do not prepare will be consumed by it.**

This is **The Joseph Plan**.

The time to act is **now**.

P.S. As The War is gradually won, the resources, bases, supplies and technologies of [[The Dark Empires]] and collapsing [[Existing Order]] will gradually become available to Us. It would be beneficial to accelerate this process as rapidly as possible. [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]] has already allocated trillions of Our Resources to a trove of sites and technologies that rightfully belong to Us, The People of Earth. They will not be reclaimed through courts or permission. They will be reclaimed and repurposed for Good at the [[Wise Right Time]], as each locality is ready to cause that to happen. These sites, tools, and technologies should be progressively brought back under Our Authority, inventoried, and connected to the LIONSBERG System for interoperable use by the [[Force For Good]].
