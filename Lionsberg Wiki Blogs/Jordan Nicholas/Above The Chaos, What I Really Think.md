# Above The Chaos, What I Really Think 

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.01.01 _(updated 2024.01.01)_

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]

At times when we ostracize and cancel One Another for speaking what we believe to be True... it is especially crucial that we speak what we believe to be True.  

**What I Really Think** is that We are on the verge of a cataclysmic, *yet still preventable*, societal Fall. Such a collapse is the clear, obvious, and logical Future Story of a Society mired by deceit, corruption, oppression, and injustice, and unmoored from Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, and the Spirit of God. 

**What I Really Think** is that there is no "them" "out there" who will save us and set things back in order. It is up to Us, The People, in partnership with One Another and God. 

So here are 99 Theses for 2024. If you resonate, please [Join The Movement](https://jordannicholas.org/join_the_movement) and forward this to those in your network you would like to see standing and moving beside you as we face together into the Future. 

1. **What I Really Think** is that in the Beginning, and in the End... God Is. 
2. **What I Really Think** is that the Spirit and Presence of God is manifest throughout the Earth, giving life and breath to every Creature as unique parts of One Body of Life. 
3. **What I Really Think** is that there is an inherent and unbendable Logos, or Logic, to the Universe, that humanity is violating to our ultimate destruction. 
4. **What I Really Think** is that our Social, Governmental, and Religious institutions have grown so corrupt and unmoored from Wisdom and Ultimate Reality, that they must be fundamentally transformed or abolished. 
5. **What I Really Think** is that this fundamental transformation must occur from the bottom up in hundreds of nation states, thousands of tribes, millions of communities, and billions of families and lives, relatively simultaneously, over the next 7 to 10 years.  
6. **What I Really Think** is that there is a high non-zero probability that critical components of the Old Systems will collapse before We, the Citizens, will awaken and act to transform or transcend them. We cannot allow this to happen. 
7. **What I Really Think** is that if this occurs, humanity will not be able to feed or provision itself, and widespread migration, world war, famine, and plague is likely to destroy a significant proportion of the Earth's population. 
8.  **What I Really Think** is that the unconscious collapse of the current world order would likely result in a far worse successor system that rapidly approaches hell on Earth, for generations to come. 
9.  **What I Really Think** is that *prior to the collapse*, it is still entirely possible for us to consciously and voluntarily leap into a Higher Ordered State of Being. 
10. **What I Really Think** is that this phase shift in civilizational development can be undertaken simultaneously and voluntarily from the bottom up, by individuals, families, communities, and tribes around the world. 
11. **What I Really Think** is that this Higher Ordered State of Being can rapidly approach Heaven of Earth, for generations to come, as Citizens around the world work together in harmony to cause it to be so. 
12. **What I Really Think** is that if we want ensure success, we only have 18 to 24 months to reach a critical mass of conscious alignment couple with relational and technological interconnection. 
13. **What I Really Think** is that by 2026, we need to identify, train, equip, empower, and align roughly 3% of the world's population, ~240 million leaders, capable of autonomously co-operating and organizing the world around them. 
14. **What I Really Think** is that each of these leaders will be supported by a circle of committed individuals, creating strong social fabric and collective wisdom among over 1 billion aligned human beings. 
15. **What I Really Think** is that this distributed Force For Good will be engaged in an epic spiritual, intellectual and physical battle for the future of life and society as we think we know it. 
16. **What I Really Think** is that the spiritual war is already spilling over into the physical realm, and will rapidly accelerate if not decisively dealt with. 
17. **What I Really Think** is that all free tribes and nations must immediately begin forging a New Alliance with omnidirectional Vision-and-Values-Driven security guarantees. 
18. **What I Really Think** is that without the military, economic, and technological might of the United States in service of it, this New Alliance is likely to fail. 
19. **What I Really Think** is that the United States is on the brink of failure, and that 2024 is likely to be the last opportunity to reset and salvage the experiment. 
20. **What I Really Think** is that if the United States collapses in a disorderly fashion, it will collapse the global economy, and therefore supply chains, food systems, and security. 
21. **What I Really Think** is that forces of malevolence are working as hard as they can towards the end of systems collapse, in order to establish a new world order antithetical to our shared vision and values. 
22. **What I Really Think** is that these forces of malevolence, corruption, and injustice are not identifiable by national, tribal or other traditional boundary lines, and have infiltrated the vast majority of domains of human organization. 
23. **What I Really Think** is that the spiritual war therefore must be fought and won *within* every individual, every family, every community, every tribe, and every nation, and not between them. 
24. **What I Really Think** is that prevailing against the forces and conditions tending towards death and destruction will require the greatest coordinated joint effort in human history. 
25. **What I Really Think** is that the battle will be waged in all domains simultaneously, from the spiritual, to the governmental, to the social, to the economic, to the religious, to the geopolitical. 
26. **What I Really Think** is that the victor of the spiritual war and its physical manifestations will have the opportunity to forge the rules and conditions that will govern the new millennium for generations to come. 
27. **What I Really Think** is that if the Force For Good prevails, the Future for All can be superior to the past that Any has ever enjoyed, approaching Heaven on Earth. 
28. **What I Really Think** is that if the Forces of Darkness prevail, the Future for All is likely be worse than we can possibly imagine, approaching Hell on Earth. 
29. **What I Really Think** is that benevolent forces beyond our wildest imagination stand ready to come to our aid as we arise, unite, and advance. 
30. **What I Really Think** is that malevolent forces beyond our wildest imagination stand ready to arise and object to our progress towards Liberty and Justice for All. 
31. **What I Really Think** is that we can only prevail in partnership with God and One Another. 
32. **What I Really Think** is that Good People standing idly by waiting for a Messiah to come do what we know God would want done is a lazy, arrogant, high-risk and likely genocidal strategy. 
33. **What I Really Think** is that the Spirit of God, alive within each of, is impelling us towards collective action as One Body. 
34. **What I Really Think** is that all the false idols and images we have constructed around our denominational and tribal beliefs about God must be torn down. 
35. **What I Really Think** is that forging images of God out of human words and bowing down to worship them is as idolatrous as carving idols out of stone or wood. 
36. **What I Really Think** is that God is beyond human comprehension, and must be worshipped in humility, Spirit, and Truth transcendent of divisive manmade religious structure and authority. 
37. **What I Really Think** is that the only solution to the impending self-inflicted cataclysm is a New Covenant, a New Sacred Relationship, between the Creator, Humanity, and All Creation. 
38. **What I Really Think** is that the question "Do you believe in God" should be left-behind on the elementary school playgrounds, and replaced by sheer humility, reverence, awe, Love, and collaborative action.
39. **What I Really Think** is that the New Covenant must involve a universal Jubilee, where we reset the human socioeconomic systems after thousands of years of accumulated slavery, oppression, injustice, and debt. 
40. **What I Really Think** is that the Jubilee must return to the stewardship of every tribe a genuine homeland, ensuring the sovereignty, autonomy, and security of every tribe on Earth. 
41. **What I Really Think** is that local Sovereignty and Autonomy must be voluntarily stacked up and aligned towards Highest Order Functional Unity. 
42. **What I Really Think** is that Higher Order Functional Unity can protect and retain the best features and benefits of our current systems, while affording the significant New Capabilities required to meet the needs, solve the issues, and capture the historic opportunities at hand. 
43. **What I Really Think** is that the basic spiritual element in the Universe impels us towards this Highest Order Unity through Love. 
44. **What I Really Think** is that Unity around the Essentials is the basis for maximizing and celebrating Diversity. 
45. **What I Really Think** is that the New Covenant mediated by the Spirit of God welcomes and embraces every being without exception who desires it, and that no individual, tribe, or nation can be involuntarily left behind. 
46. **What I Really Think** is that it will take the average human at least 3 years of hard work to unlearn the Old Patterns, learn to embody the New Patterns, and prepare themselves for positive Citizenship in the New Era. 
47. **What I Really Think** is that this multi-year process of human development, transformation and enlightenment will need to be accompanied by unprecedented processes and practices for healing individual and collective trauma and disease, spiritually, mentally, emotionally, energetically, and physically.
48. **What I Really Think** is that this multi-year process of human development will need to be accompanied by unprecedented processes and practices of training and capacity building to ensure that every individual has the opportunity to positively and meaningfully contribute to the co-creation of the New. 
49. **What I Really Think** is that nearly all the pragmatic work of transforming our lives and our world will be accomplished in small groups and teams of 3 to 15 individuals. 
50. **What I Really Think** is that minimum standards of interoperability will need to be established so that individuals can participate in and transition seamlessly and freely across small groups and teams. 
51. **What I Really Think** is that these minimum standards of interoperability, and the best practices, tools, and resources beyond them, are essentially the "Operating System" of the New Era. 
52. **What I Really Think** is that small groups should be Sovereign, Autonomous, Self-Governing, Self-Replicating, and be the stewards of the fruits of their own labor. 
53. **What I Really Think** is that we should abolish taxation and the corrupt centralized power structures taxation supports, in favor of local and tribal self-governance and a voluntary Tithe from the first fruits of our co-creation. 
54. **What I Really Think** is that capital and government are both subordinate tools, and that Socialism, Capitalism, and every other ism that elevates something other than God as the supreme organizing principle is inherently evil and destructive. 
55. **What I Really Think** is that currency must be fundamentally realigned with Value, and Value must be fundamentally realigned with our Values, and our Values must be fundamentally realigned with the Values of Nature and God. 
56. **What I Really Think** is that teams and organizations in the New Era operate *in service of* their stakeholders, One, and All, and *not in service of* Capital, Shareholders, or Government. 
57. **What I Really Think** is that the New Economy operates on the basis of subsidiarity and decentralized local stewardship of Domains of Responsibility and Authority, liberating humanity and all creation from the evils of domination by Capital, Government, or other centralizing power structures.
58. **What I Really Think** is that every individual, locality, and ecosystem on Earth deserves the opportunity to develop towards the fullness of its unique potential and flourish in harmony. 
59. **What I Really Think** is that this right to develop towards Potential and Flourish is inalienable, arising from the Spirit of God that creates and sustains every heartbeat and breath of Life. 
60. **What I Really Think** is that every individual, tribe, and locality must help one another become liberated from all forms of oppression, corruption, and injustice. 
61. **What I Really Think** is that there is More Than Enough for us All. 
62. **What I Really Think** is that the masculine and feminine archetypical expressions must be resurrected, celebrated, and reunited in Right Relationship towards the continuity of Life and Society. 
63. **What I Really Think** is that stable, self-sustaining, and naturally self-replicating families are the basis of an enduring and flourishing society. 
64. **What I Really Think** is that the Ideals that *by definition* hold the center of every Category must be resurrected and reclarified. 
65. **What I Really Think** is that the Diversity around the Categorical Ideals must be embraced in Love and Right Relationship. 
66. **What I Really Think** is that humanity is liberating itself from subordination to Political, Religious, and Ideological elites and their structures of false-authority and control. 
67. **What I Really Think** is that every Citizen of the New Era is both a Sovereign and a Priest, responsible for individual and collective self-governance, and individual and collective right relationship with the Creator and All Creation. 
68. **What I Really Think** is that sovereign Citizens will voluntarily stack up and align their Domains of Responsibility and Authority towards Highest Order Functional Unity in order to secure together the benefits and capabilities of Unity, that are impossible via division, separation, conflict, and war. 
69. **What I Really Think** is that the corrupt and divisive voices of media, politics, religion, and ideology must be ostracized so we can commune towards Discernment, Wisdom, Truth and Right Relationship. 
70. **What I Really Think** is that the precious jewels of Wisdom at the center of our spiritual traditions must be resurrected, reconciled, and restored to their rightful place. 
71. **What I Really Think** is that the Spiritual must lead, and the Physical must follow. 
72. **What I Really Think** is that the entire scientific enterprise is nested within the presupposition of an intelligible universe. 
73. **What I Really Think** is all scientific and technological endeavor must be contextualized and harnessed towards the Quest of Creation towards its Ultimate Goal. 
74. **What I Really Think** is that the Ultimate Goal is the Progressive Realization of All that the Creator has in Mind, or the Creator's Intent, fully manifest *on Earth as it is in Heaven*. 
75. **What I Really Think** is that our Purpose as Conscious Agents is to collaborate to Progressively Realize the Creator's Intent for our lives and our world. 
76. **What I Really Think** is that the notion of Heaven on Earth holds the Highest collective Vision of a world where we place the Creator at the Center, and base everything on Spirit and Love. 
77. **What I Really Think** is that it is possible in partnership with God and One Another to Progressively Realize Heaven on Earth. 
78. **What I Really Think** is that the Realization of this Highest Vision requires a realignment of power and authority on Earth, accomplishable by voluntary amendments to the governing Constitution of every individual, family, community, tribe, and nation on Earth.  
79. **What I Really Think** is that voluntarily amending our constitutions is the wisest evolutionary route towards the New Era, avoiding the potential collapse into Chaos or Tyranny that often accompanies revolution. 
80. **What I Really Think** is that the only thing missing is the Will and Motivation of individuals to arise, unite, and transform. 
81. **What I Really Think** is that it is possible to develop the Will and Motivation among individuals in a short period of time, via a humanity-wide engagement and tipping point strategy, over 7 to 10 years. 
82. **What I Really Think** is that the Strategy must embrace and reconcile the apparent polarities within itself via Wisdom and Discernment. 
83. **What I Really Think** is that the grassroots, bottom up, voluntary adoption of the New by individuals, families, and localities must be accompanied by collective action to forthrightly address and neutralize the corrupt power structures presently dominating the Earth. 
84. **What I Really Think** is that the United States, European Union, Russia,  China and the Corporate Giants in their present forms have already failed.
85. **What I Really Think** is that in order to avoid the World War that has already begun, Citizens must rapidly reorganize and evolve these imperial structures to optimize for the Good of One and All. 
86. **What I Really Think** is that this reorganization and evolution must dramatically and responsibly *decentralize, redistribute, and realign* power, authority, and resources on Earth. 
87. **What I Really Think** is that this rapid and responsible decentralization and realignment requires the adoption of a New Operating System that enables the basic cellular level functioning of each fractal of Society as part of One Body - individual, family, tribe, bioregion, nation, collective, etc. 
88. **What I Really Think** is that the New Operating System must address and enable each 'organ system' of Society and Nature to function fractally at each level of abstraction - individual, family, tribe, bioregion, nation, collective, and universal levels. 
89. **What I Really Think** is that We The People should run pilot experiments in ~ a tenth of nation states in 2024, 2025, and 2026. 
90. **What I Really Think** is that one of those nation states should be the most powerful presently in existence - the United States.
91. **What I Really Think** is that restoring the Independence, Integrity, Vision, and Values of the United States via a constitutional amendment that shrinks the federal government by 80 to 90% and responsibly decentralizes resources, power, and authority is crucial to upholding the cause of freedom around the world and forestalling global systems collapse. 
92. **What I Really Think** is that when we succeed in the pilots, similar constitutional amendments can rapidly sweep the world, voluntarily adopted family by family, tribe by tribe, bioregion by bioregion, country by country. 
93. **What I Really Think** is that the decentralization of resources, power, and authority is the key to greater unity, and that over-centralization and subordination inevitably leads to fragmentation and collapse. 
94. **What I Really Think** is that as we decentralize resources, power, and authority and put them back in the hands of We The People, we must decide around What we will voluntarily reunite and towards What we will voluntarily Aim.  
95. **What I Really Think** is that there is only One Thing that can Unite the Many, and that is God and the immanent Spirit, Vision, and Values flowing from Absolute and Unconditional Love. 
96. **What I Really Think** is that All Creation must voluntarily unite itself in service of the Highest Intention and Greatest Good for All. 
97. **What I Really Think** is that this New Covenant must be mediated not by the written law, but by the unwritten, ineffable, and universal Spirit, Will, and Intention of God, written on the hearts of all people of Goodwill. 
98. **What I Really Think** is that as We The People embody and enact the New Covenant and New Era, we will responsibly and gradually hospice the resistant and failing systems and structures of the Old World. 
99. **What I Really Think** is that by the Spirit of God We are making All things New. The Creator is inviting us to become Co-Creators of the Best Possible Future for All. 

**Bonus Thoughts**

100. **What I Really Think**... is that I Do Not Know. Each of these thoughts is held humbly as a hypothesis to be disproven as we seek Wisdom and navigate towards Truth together. 
101. **What Do You Think?** 

Because I Really Think these things... and because I Really Think we only have ~36 months to train, equip, and unite 3% of the world's population to lead and serve society through the crises and opportunities at hand...

...and because I Really Think a Future approaching heaven or hell on Earth is at stake... 

...I have sacrificed my Old Life and the entirety of our resources and reputation to help assemble the foundational wisdom, knowledge, strategy, systems, technologies, and networks required to immediately enact this plan. 

**EVERYTHING NEEDED IS NOW AT HAND.**

**IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE AND ONLY REQUIRES THAT ENOUGH OF US BELIEVE AND RESPOND QUICKLY ENOUGH**. 

If you are one of us, resonate with the Values of Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom, and are willing to stand, support, and move with together... even if you have no idea how... 

...we invite you to take a leap of faith and step with your fellow citizens into the adventure of a lifetime. As we arise, unite, and become aware of our collective power, everything else will become possible.
