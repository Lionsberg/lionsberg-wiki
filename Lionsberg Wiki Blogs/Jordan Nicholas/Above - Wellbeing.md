# Wellbeing

The spinal chord and neural network - the basis of communication. 

Every day it needs to stretch. Yoga namiscal. Feet together - sit down in a squat... best if you can put feet together and squat... next best - feet in line with shoulder. 7, 14, or 21. 

Some way to gauge the sharpness of intillect... you can see a difference - just with a few simple movements to set your physiologiy in proper order.... 

How do we measure this? 

The achiles heel. Touching to perrineum... thoughts clear, emotions out. 
- energy systems 

We all have our own experiences, imprints, that influence perception. 

Not taking a position, looking at everything fresh every moment of their life... 

Even people - after 35 years... I don't have an opinion about them. 

When I need to accomplish work, I assess their capacity, capability, and willingness. 

We constantly look at eveyr life as a possiblity... there is distance between possiblity and reality. 

Some will have the courage and commitment to travel the distance, others will not. 

Don't form opinions - simply look at them right now. 

Tomorrow must be created. 

There is a difference to be fit... fitness is a consequence... important thing to get the right geometry of life... physical universe is all geometry... how geometrically perfect it is... 

Fundmantal sacred order and geometry of life... 

How to go through hard situations joyfully... 
if you don't want to suffer - you will avoid all possiblity... 

When in a certain state - you are willing to go through anything no matter what it is. 

How balanced you are. 
How clearly you perceive. 
How well you do things. 
Simply depends on how in sync and in flow you are... 

With the people, plants, animals, life, consciousness and space around you. 

## 100 Steps to Transform Our Lives and Our World 

[Rick Rubin: Protocols to Access Creative Energy and Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpgqXCkRO-w)  





106. Infrastructure  

  


## A Practice; A Process; A Way of Being 

Everything is One. 

The Purpose and Way of life must be united. 

Every breath, every heartbeat, every bite, every sip, every step, every thought, every word, every action... 

The way you lay, the way you sit, the way you stand, the way you walk, the way you breathe, the way you conduct / govern / navigate / pilot your embodiment, your energy, your mind, your emotions... 

...always progressing, always advancing... 

This is the Way. This is the Practice. 

Everything is the Way. Everything is Practice. Everything is a Process. 

The Lionsberg System is not about the Answers. It is about the continually wrestling with the Questions, the Process, the Practice through which we Become. 

## Questions

Existence is a Process, not a Conclusion. 

It is about Grappling with Reality and Ultimate Reality. It is about wrestling with the Universe and with God. 

The Ultimate Knowing is Ultimately Ineffable. It is [[Non-Propositional]] in Nature. 

The Beginner's Mind is always searching. Always asking Questions. The intellect that asks the Questions cannot know the Ultimate Answers. The Ultimate Answers can only be revealed to the Spirit through Transformational Process and Practice.  

To know the Way, one must live it. 

## Gaps 

Anytime we create an articulated propositional representation of Reality or Ultimate Reality, we are scratching the surface of something that is [[Ultimately Ineffable]] and [[Ultimately Incomprehensible]] by the the human intellect. 

We are taking the gestalt of existence itself and its manifestation throughout the Universe, and attempting to categorize and map it. That is the function of the Intellect, the [[Left Hemisphere]]. 

It is easy for the ultimately ignorant intellect to find gaps, dross, perceived misrepresentations in the representation and leap to judgment. 

Instead of judging and assuming, it would be wise to ask a question that illuminates the gap, so that we can fill it. 

## Consciousness

Is the most fundamental thing. It is an intelligence that transcends physiological and psychological structure. 

## Spirit 

Manifests, animates, and impels. Deeper than Energy. Deeper than Information. 
## Energy 

A way of composing, cultivating, and channeling energy. 

## Information 

Informs energy. 

## Nature / The Living System 

We are a part of it. We interexist within it. 

There is only One Life. There is only One Living System. 
## Embodiment 

From that Living Cosmos, we are individually conceived and a fragment of the infinite potential of Spirit, Life, and Consciousness becomes incarnate in individuated and embodied form. 

From that standpoint, every perceived Individual must come to terms with both their individuated Embodiment and Mind, and their interexistent ultimate unity of Life and Spirit. 

The vessel in which the individuated aspect of our Spirit is incarnated. 

Our Embodiment is merely [[Associative Energy]] that has been gathered together into form. From the [[Soil]] come Plants and Animals, which we select and [[Consciously Choose]] to consume as [[Food]], which becomes the slight bit of [[Physicality]] that we perceive as our flesh, blood, and body.  

However within that associated [[Mass-Energy]], 99.999999...% of it is "empty" space. If you try to investigate it, you will discover that "it" is not really "there". The closer you look, the more you will discover that Ultimately there are no discrete "Things" in Universe. 

And yet as a human species, we are stuck in the endless [[Chaos]] and [[Strife]] that comes from mistakenly attaching our identities to the 0.00000000...1% of the Living System that is Physical, rather than the 99.999999999% that is Metaphysical.  

What we [[Accumulate]] into our body, or mind, or lives, is not "us". It is merely some infinitesimally small aspect of The Whole we Grasp and Steward for some period of time, before it Dissociates from "us", or we Dissociate from "it."

What we [[Co-Create]], either through our sexuality, our creative consciousness, or our work, becomes another living, incarnate of The Whole, The Living System, and has the opportunity to Live beyond us if we cultivate, mature, and liberate it properly. 

When we die, all the [[Associative Energy]] that was aggregated into our [[Embodiment]] decomposes and returns to the [[Soil]]. From dust to dust. But nothing is lost. It is all part of the One. 

Our Embodiments are merely a [[SpatioTemporal]] vessel, that we can learn to Consciously Conduct and Transform to Co-Create an ever more beautiful, flourishing, and abundant Reality. 

Fundamentally, this means that we must understand our basic biology, our basic anatomy, and our basic sexuality through which our ongoing existence as a species is conceived, while simultaneously transcending it to Primarily Identify not with that tiny fragment of [[Physicality]] we have Accumulated or Acquired, and not just with Who We Are, but with the Deepest and Most Fundamental Source of Who We Are and Who We Are Becoming as One interexistent [[Divine Symphony]] of Co-Creation. 

## Consciously Conducting Our Bodies, Our Minds, and Our World 

As a human being, one of the primary acts is the [[Conscious Selection]] of our [[Primary Identity]]. 

Some humans are primarily identified with their Embodiment. 

Some humans are primarily identified with their Mind. 

However our [[Physiological and Psychological Structure]] are not us. They are merely reflections of the Energy and Information we have accumulated through our [[Experience]] aboard Earth.  

When we touch the Deeper Dimensions of Spirit and Consciousness, we naturally shift our [[Primary Identity]] Beyond our Physical Embodiment and Mind, and towards [[Ultimate Reality]]. 

It cannot come from mere thought or mere intellectual assent to an Idea or a Religion.  

It has to come from direct, personal, transformational experience. Touching the Deeper Dimensions. Discovering and then immersing your Individuated Spirit and Consciousness in the depths of its Source, the Generative Source of the Universe. Touching the hem of the proverbial garment of God. 

When this occurs, when you begin to taste and see the Goodness and Greatness of the Interexistent Whole, then all the strife and struggle between the perceived Categories, Individuations, and Localities begins to fade away and disappear in the awe-inspiring presence of the [[One]]. 

## Reaching Out and Touching the Deepest Dimensions 

Step 1: Recognizing the distance between You, your mind, and your body. 

## Spiritual Work 

Our most important [[Work]] is [[Spiritual]] in nature. 

By Spiritual, we mean that it is in the realm of Existence and Experience that transcends the merely Physical and Psychological. 

It is only by learning to Primarily Identify with what lies beyond the [[SpatioTemporal]] vapor of our bodies and minds that we can truly transform our lives and our world. 
## Thinking, Feeling and Knowing with the Entire Being 

This allows us to Think, to Feel, and to Know with our entire Being, Spirit, Mind, and Body, and not merely the shallow thoughts of our physical brain and perceptions of our physical embodiment. 

Thought should not be merely from the limited information you have gathered into your body and mind. 

The [[Infinite Intelligence]] of the Creator and Creation is happening Beyond Thought through your entire Embodiment and Interexistence in Universe. Transforming food, air, water, soil, microbes into ever more diverse and complex forms of Life. 

## The Health and Wellbeing of the Body and Mind 

Keeping our bodies and minds healthy, well, and pain free liberates us to engage with the Deeper Dimensions of existence and co-creation. 

If one small part of the body is suffering, the whole body suffers, and the suffering consumes our [[Attention]]. 

## Food

Local, fresh, healthy thriving. 
## Apparent Polarities, and the Masculine and Feminine  

Within the Ultimate Unity of Universe, Creation unfurls itself through the reciprocating dance of apparent polarities. 

One reciprocal polarity is [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]]. 

The [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]] unfolds itself along a spectrum, from the most [[Masculine Archetype]] to the most [[Feminine Archetype]]. 

The distributed array of Masculine and Feminine expression around [[The Archetypes that Define the Categories]] is associated with, but independent of, [[Biological Sex]], or [[Male]] and [[Female]], with some Males exhibiting more Feminine characteristics than many Females, and some Females exhibiting more Masculine characteristics than many Males. 

[[Male]] and [[Female]] are fundamental biological facets that enable the co-creation of Life, the Female being perhaps most fundamentally defined as the sex that produces the larger gametes / ovum / egg cell that *selects* which male gamete (sperm cell) to fuse with during sexual reproduction. 

Just as [[God]] / [[One]] organizes, integrates, balances, and properly orders all apparent polarities and dualities within Itself, so too must fully integrated human beings acknowledge and properly order, balance, integrate and cohere the [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]] within them Selves, regardless of whether their physical Embodiment has manifested as biologically [[Male]] or [[Female]].  

This is a natural and necessary part of transcending mere biological and [[SpatioTemporal]] existence and rediscovering one's [[Primary Identity]] at the deeper levels of Spirit and Consciousness, rather than the shallower levels of Body and Mind. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]] and many traditions, this idea of fractally balancing and cohering all [[Apparent Polarities]] across all [[Levels of Analysis]] in order to optimize [[Potential]] is known as [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]].  

The act of [[Balancing On The Tip Of The Needle]] allows us to celebrate, embrace, and even become living expressions of the most Archetypical Expressions of each of the [[Apparent Polarities]], without being unbalanced, skewed, and therefore Unwise on any dimension of existence. 

[[Balance]]. [[Equilibrium]]. [[Flow]]. 

## Collaboration and Coexistence 

From the individual, the very basic idea of how we interexist, how we coexist, how we collaborate and co-operate across all fractal levels. 

## Service vs. Exploitation 

In the Spiritual Logic, or [[Logos]], the strongest manifest aspects of Creation must protect, serve, and empower the weaker and more vulnerable aspects of Creation. 

The drive to dominate and exploit must be overcome by Spirit and Consciousness, through Love. 

Power must be exercised 
## Tools and Technology 

The Universe is Technology. It [[Logos]] and [[Intelligibility]] affords the opportunity for Creatures to build Tools and Technologies. 

Tools and Technologies ultimately increase [[Power]], or the amount of [[Energy]] channeled per unit of [[Time]].

## Power 


## Bathing 

Historically, it is a dip into the river of ocean... water a little cooler than room temperature. Cells contract, pores open between. we want the cellular structure of the body to be charged with different dimension. Before practice yoga. Charging cellular structure with energy. 

5 to 8 Celcius lower than temp. 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. Not excessively cold. 

Any time mixing, physical contact. First go home and shower - any time there is mixing... shower several times a day. holding hands... it is a way of organizing your energy... the interaction... creates... integrity of energy becomes a little loose. 

- [Sadhguru on Bathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk3_03LrrM0)  

## Walking 

Walk barefoot daily to ground, integrate, and exchange energy with the Earth. 

They key points in your body must be in touch with the Earth. 

Integrating and organizing the energy of your body. 

- [Sadhguru - Eat Less and Walk Barefoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prsysbl_P0E)  

## Prostration 

Taking a dip in the temple pond, and tehn prostrating. Everything in your body coming in contact. The key points in your body must be in touch with the Earth. 

Sadhana 

## Chanting 


## Daily Movements 

- Squat 
	- With feet together - 21x if possible  
	- With feet shoulder width - 21x if possible 
	- Why? 
		- Builds leg muscle  
		- Stretches and composes spine  
		- Greater degrees of hip flexion straighten the anal canal and aid in defecation  
	- [Sadhguru on Squatting and Sitting]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ39-Qhc1ZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ39-Qhc1ZM))  

## The Limitations of Experience, and Experiential Learning

Whatever we hear or perceive, we interpret according to the experiences we have had in Life. 

Every being has a unique level of Experience and Understanding. 

## Volunteering

Doing something willingly. No compulsion. Acting out of your own free will in service of a [[Greater Good]]. 

Lionsberg is a [[Volunteer Force Force Good]]. There is no compelled service. There are no [[Employee Consumer Slaves]]. In the New World we are all Free and Empowered Co-Creators. 
## Withholding Judgment and Learning To Work With Others  

We are the kinds of people the world is made up of. Perfectly Imperfect. 

If you want to only work with ideal people, you will be alone in your delusion that you are superior to all the perfectly imperfect people around you. 

If we believe in our Mission; if we truly desire to co-operate as One Spiritual Body of Creation, then we must learn to co-operate with All Creation in the positive transformation of our lives and our world. 



## Organizing, Integrating, and Conducting Your Own Being of Your Own Free Will and Volition 

Sovereignty, Autonomy, Self Governance. 

Not giving others the power... 
- to make you happy  
- to make you sad  
- to compel you to think, say or do something  

Being integrated and secure in Who You Are and Who You Are Becoming. Not looking to others for permission or approval. 
## Fear 

Humanity is often held back from experiencing the fullness of Life, Liberty, and Who They Could Be out of [[Fear]]. 

The [[Fear of Suffering]]  
The [[Fear Of Death]]  
The [[Fear of Hell]]  
The [[Fear of Poverty]]  
The [[Fear of Rejection]]  

Liberty from fear is accomplished primarily through shifting ones [[Primary Identity]] beyond their [[Physiological and Psychological Structure]], towards Spirit and Consciousness, and Ultimately God. 

Once you Understand the True Nature of Who You Are, and that [[You Are Not Your Body or Your Mind]], and that no matter what your body and mind experience, You will be ok, you become Free to Move, to Explore, to Grow, to Develop, and to Become. 
## War

The largest industry in the world is arms and armament. 

Our economies cannot exist in their present state without war. 

We are actively sowing conflict and division, corruption and chaos, and arming the factions with ever more powerful weapons. 

Within your own heart, minds, thoughts, words, actions - transforming hatred, transforming violence, and stopping the absolutely insane production and propagation of ever more powerful weapons.
