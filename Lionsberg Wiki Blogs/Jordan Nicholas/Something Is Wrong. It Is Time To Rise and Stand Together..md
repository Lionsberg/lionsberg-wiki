Beloved Ones and Allies,

Something is _wrong_. Can you feel it?

I pray that most of us paying attention now know that the major terror events, assassinations, and wars of our lifetimes and recent history were orchestrated deceptions. Tens of trillions have been stolen, millions murdered by deep-state forces, and political puppets dangled before us as false choices within a soul-crushing matrix of kontrolle.

The deeper, more painful truth is the realization that our favored political, religious, and cultural leaders have been complicit in an unholy alliance spanning generations. It hurts to admit that **We The People** have not had a functioning or coherent system of self-governance, religion, culture, education, or economy on Earth for a very long time, and that many of the foundational narratives We were raised in were carefully constructed illusions.

Ouch.

Take a breath and sense inward.  
How does it feel to truly see this?  
To admit this?  
It pains **Us All** because it matters so damn much.  

As we move from the corrupted roots to their devastating fruits—endless wars, ecological ruin, cultural erosion, divided communities, billions enslaved by debt, poverty, and lack—this global system reveals itself not merely as **anti-human**, but as fundamentally **anti-Life**, **anti-Source**, and opposed to all that is **Wise, Right, True, Loving, Just, Beautiful, and Good**.

We we born into the end stages of an incarnate **Anti-System**.

And yet, an even deeper deception is at play: transnational Dark Forces collaborate and war with non-human beings, craft, and technologies. Protocols and treaties intended to govern humanity’s extraterrestrial interactions for the next 10,000 years are being finalized by 2028—_**without Our participation or consent**_.  

It is undoubtedly _**The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History**_.

Are we still quiet, divided, and impotent because we do not know?  
Because we are afraid?  
Because we feel helpless, overwhelmed, or too busy?  
Or perhaps because we cannot yet see clearly a Path forward?  

Have we drifted so far into complacency, hopelessness, or cynicism that there will be no meaningful objection, no courageous resistance, no decisive stand?  

May it never be so.  

Yesterday, here in Kenya, there was an objection. The image above was captured amidst protests that left at least 16 youth dead and hundreds wounded while demanding justice for hundreds of murdered or missing young leaders brutally silenced over the past year. And yet somehow their voices are growing louder from graves and prisons that can never contain their Spirit. As the Playbook of Empire and Oligarchy spurred both the protestors and militarized police towards violence, a government-imposed media blackout followed, forcibly shutting down communications as streets filled with tears, tear gas, bullets, courage, and rage. Just days before, deeply guided by Spirit, I slipped into East Africa through Qatar—moments before the latest salvos of World War IV closed Middle Eastern skies.  

I asked a precious 12 year old what she thought.  
"It is a war" she said.  

Indeed.  
**The War** is ratcheting up.  
Whether We chose it or not, it is Our present Reality and immediate Future.  
Silence, complacency, and waiting to see will not resolve it.  

## What Will You Do? Where Do You Stand? Who Will You Stand With?

My best understanding is this: The existential war for the future of life and civilization is now in full swing and will be decided in the next 3 to 7 years. Within 6 to 24 months it will be too late to meaningful organize. The default trajectory—in over 90% of future scenarios—is a descent into chaos, tyranny, collapse, and kontrolle. Without radical intervention, billions perish, and generations suffer over centuries or millennia to come.  

**But it does not have to be this way.**  
**Heaven on Earth is within our grasp.**  

If billions of us simply accept The Invitation, arise and stand together  
in Unity with [[ONE]] and [[One Another]],  
if we insist on co-creating the Best Possible Future for All,  
Heaven on Earth becomes our immediate lived Reality.  

The Creator is inviting Us All to become Co-Creators  
of A Better World.  

The question and invitation is simple:  

Facing the Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History,  
What will you do? Where will you stand? Who will you stand with?  

## Will You Stand With Us? 

At this critical juncture—an unprecedented crisis matched by unprecedented opportunity that none of Us can solve alone—the invitation is simple and clear: 

**Who Will Rise and Stand With Us?**  

For the last seven years, I've devoted everything I had—my old life, resources, and world—to forging a foundation I call _**LIONSBERG**_, a free gift to all ready to align and co-create our shared Future.

From now until **July 1st**, I hold open the door for you, my personal network, to step forward as **Supporters** or **Founding Members** of an emergent sovereign superorganism created by and for **Us The People**.  

My prayer is that by this date, at least 12 to 20 of us formally become **We The People of LIONSBERG**—to begin making decisions together, allocating resources together, supporting one another, and consciously navigating together towards [[The Goal]].  

In the coming weeks, I will also be extending this equal and sacred invitation to some of **Us The People of East Africa**. It matters not where the Founding Members come from, only that The First Few of Us Rise, Stand Together, and Advance. 

I pray my full-time role can then shift from architecting the foundational conditions to serving and supporting the growth of this living New Sovereignty, encompassing **[[The First Three Percent]]** of humanity by December 2026.

Standing together, ~250 million strong, **everything becomes possible**.

## A Way Forward

Many of Us are here explicitly for **This Moment and Mission**:  
To arise and unite as a capable and coherent **Force For Good**,  
capable of meeting needs, solving problems,  
prevailing in this existential struggle,  
and leading humanity toward the flourishing future we have always dreamed of.

Every moment of our lives has prepared us for this precise moment.

It is Time.

If you feel this resonance and call, please Join Us as a Supporter or a Founding Member. Simply RSVP via the link below, opt in with a meaningful opening contribution, and We will personally reach out with clear next steps and pathways.

#### **Your presence matters immensely. The Time is Now.**
