## Abstract 

This 3-4 page working document outlines the transition from the self-funded aggregation of tens of millions of dollars of Value into the Lionsberg Commons during [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] (2017-2024 Q1), towards raising a $10 Million [[Resource Tranche 2]] as we commence the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to avert world war, overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], connect and empower the leading 3% of the population, and collaborate to land humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]].  
## Introduction and Context 

Hello friends, allies, and co-creators, 

On its quest towards Destiny, humanity is at a pivotal point. The path we are collectively on isn't working. As we face into the [[Meta Crisis]], it is apparent that the systems, institutions, and ways of being that led us here will not carry us forward to [[The Future]] we dream of—a world filled with peace, love, justice, abundance, opportunity and freedom for our children, grandchildren and future generations. 

Adding urgency to the situation, a growing array of prophetic voices are warning of a significant [[Non-Zero Probability of Systems Collapse]] and World War. Both indigenous voices and modern analysts are warning that the death of 2/3 of the life on Earth is a likely outcome of the existing trajectory towards ecological, social, and geopolitical collapse coupled with the chaos, conflict, and tyranny that inevitably follows. [[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]] and the other [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] examine this in more detail. 

To make matters worse, it has become increasingly apparent the last several years that the [[Visible Power Structures]] we have looked to for leadership and guidance in the past have been co-opted and are being collusively puppeted by parasitical, corrupt, and willfully blind [[Invisible Power Structures]]. 

As generations gaze together into the [[Meta Crisis]] and across [[The Chasm]] that separates us from [[The Future We Seek]], a [[New Vision and Plan]] is urgently required. 
### The Dawn of a Movement

Anticipating this moment, in 2017 we opened [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] and began laying the foundations for an omniconsiderate planetary joint venture to shift human consciousness, unite an [[Optimally Decentralized]] [[Force For Good]], and land humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

This process led us through over a thousand dialogues, thousands of pages of distillation, the curation and co-creation of tens of millions of dollars of Value in a purpose-built Commons, and testing of core infrastructure and technology with hundreds of groups in 50+ countries. 

On March 1st 2024, we transitioned from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning|Seven Years of Preparation]] to a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to rebuild the foundations of our society and catalyze a movement towards [[The Goal]]. This movement aims to reunite citizens in transforming our society and regenerating our planet by inviting individuals to awaken, arise, take back up the responsibility and authority we have abdicated, and become [[Co-Creators]] of the [[Better World]] we know is possible and intended to be. 

Our aim is to connect, equip, and empower [[The First Three Percent]] of the population by 2026 (~250 Million Individuals), creating a powerful and optimally decentralized [[Force For Good]] capable of working together to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. Following this significant milestone, we will progressively invite all humanity to take up an equal [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New Era]] we are co-creating. 
### The First Eight Cycles of Growth 

After 7 years of co-creating the conditions to facilitate an emergent process, we are monitoring the organic growth of the movement using the metaphor of a Sacred Tree emerging from [[The Golden Seed]]. After testing the foundational infrastructure to our satisfaction with hundreds of groups in ~50+ countries, over the first ~90 days, we completed the first eight [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], connecting the first 60+ carefully selected [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] while surfacing a list of hundreds of the [[Wise Right People]] to invite in next. These first 100 to 200 co-creators are network nodes that bring every requisite resource and relationship within one relational degree. 

### 120 Day Plan 

The bold and transformative plan below requires requires completion of [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth|Cycles 9 through 12]] at no more than 4 week intervals, as well as sufficient resourcing via [[Resource Tranche 2]]. 

1. June: 
	1. Continue to monitor the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]], paving the way towards a first [[Quarterly Summit]] in July. 
	2. Respond to the first nations with the preliminary strategy and plan to heal and generate society and the earth. 
	3. Raise [[Resource Tranche 2]] ($10M)
2. Early July: 
	1. 10 to 30 person [[Quarterly Summit]] to refine the 10 year grand strategy, initiate System Wide Master Planning Process, and pull-plan aligned Q3 objectives 
3. July – September: 
	1. Identify and orient representatives from each bioregion and critical domain, and forge a functioning cabinet / executive function  
	2. Autonomous teams tackle their puzzle pieces within a shared network of commitments required to advance  
	3. Begin ecosystemic / federated resource flows 
4. Early September: Several network convenings (Gathering of the Tribes, Transformative Impact Summit, Independent Convention, etc.) 
5. Late September: First General Assembly, ~ 140 to 400 representatives from bioregions / tribes around the world. Ratify the Grand Strategy and Governance System for [[The Grand Collaboration]]  
	1. Backbone infrastructure ready for large scale gamified on-boarding process 
6. October: Massive scale global outreach / planetary awareness (Rick Lukens et al)  
	1. Begin raise for [[Resource Tranche 3]] ($100M)  
	2. For comparison, Live Aid in the 80s raised $100M+, and the phone operators estimated they only were able to field 10% of the calls. 
7. November: Target of Opportunity: Sweep an independent candidate, cabinet, and aligned governors into office in the US. Likely a write in candidate with front and back end citizen-led auditing / quality assurance process. The next 10 years will be considerably easier if the American Experiment does not collapse, and the US President is one of us.    
	1. [[Jordan]] is registering as a write-in candidate, and seeking 3 to 5 other qualified citizens to do the same.  
8. 2025 and beyond: 
	1. Accelerate efforts to connect, equip and empower the first 3% (~250 million co-creators) by 2026 - bioregional plans, hubs, federating, etc.  
	2. Continue [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] to heal and regenerate society and the planet.

### The Greatest Show 

Following ratification of [[The Grand Strategy]] in September, we intend to launch publicly in October, advancing towards a series of shows and events that draw inspiration from Live Aid and other historic cultural moments that have touched the hearts and minds of billions. 

### The First 3% 

The widespread planetary awareness campaign(s), coupled to the invitational strategy to [[Pass The Flame]] to the Wise Right next co-creators, is intended to surface [[The First Three Percent]] of most capable and enlightened leaders, who we aim to connect, equip, and empower by 2026.= (~250 million individuals). This milestone is accomplished with the successful completion of the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth|40th Cycle of Growth]]. As of June 2024, there are 31 cycles remaining to this milestone and 31 months to achieve it, requiring a minimum [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] of ~4 weeks.  

### Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating Teams

Leaders will be encouraged to forge [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] teams, while learning to co-operate as an [[Optimally Decentralized]] [[Team of Teams]]. 

### Bioregional / Watershed / Community Based Implementation

[[The First Three Percent]] will lead their local neighborhoods, watersheds, and bioregions through a poly-centric implementation process to clarify local vision, values, opportunities, and needs. 

### 90 Day Quests

Autonomous leaders and teams will be invited to engage in a series of continually more challenging and meaningful [[Quarterly Quests]], [[Stacking Up And Aligning]] co-creative efforts via the [[Network of Commitments]] to produce [[Throughput]] of the [[Critical Path]] discerned through the [[System Wide Master Planning Process]].  


### Implementation Hubs 

[[Instantiation Hubs]] will be progressively rolled out bioregionally around the planet to physically connect, equip, and empower teams and localities.  

### Ecosystememic Resource Flows and Supply Chain Management

The Lionsberg Platform and Networked Instantiation Hubs will enable ecosystemic resource flows and [[Optimally Decentralized]] planetary supply chain management, connecting and empowering localities, for the first time in history, to transparently visualize and allocate excesses and shortages, stocks and flows, information and solutions. 

### Value Creation 

[[Quarterly Quests]] that collectively produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] optimally create [[Value]] for humanity and the planet. 

Our interim target is to have at least 50 million teams engaged in quarterly quests with an average [[Value]] of at least $10,000 by 2026, co-creating [[Flow]] of at least a half trillion dollars of [[Value]] every 90 days within 30 months. 

[[Value Creation]] will be tracked via both local fiat currency and [[Lionsberg Units of Value (LUV)]], paving the way towards the integrated planetary [[Time-Energy Accounting]] system. 

### A Blended Ecosystem 

All Teams will Federate their activities, leading to a blended post-[[Mondragon]] ecosystem of for-profit and non-profit entities and real properties. Federating will be done fractally, with major federal nodes each serving and supporting ~100,000 co-creators. 

10% of the flow will be tithed to The Commons to continuously improve the infrastructure, services, and support empowering all co-creators in the New Confederation. 

### A New Confederation

This New Confederation would constitute the largest private economic federation in the world and would rank in the top 10 in terms of both population and GDP if treated as a nation. 

We plan to monitor the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] against the list of [[Countries By Population]], and begin expanding the exchange of [[Diplomatic Recognition]] with various tribes and nations through 2025 and 2026. 
### Working Capital 

The [[Provisional Structure]] has been instantiated to deal with a combination of philanthropic, investment, and political capital flows. 

Following the example of [[Mondragon]] that successfully grew out beyond $10 Billion / year, investment capital in [[The System]] will be paid an annual rate of return varying from 0% to 7% based on system performance, as determined by the [[Lionsberg General Assembly]]. 

### Resource Tranches 

- [[Resource Tranche 1]] (2017-Q1 2024): Tens of millions of dollars of Value curated in the [[Lionsberg Commons]], ~$2M in capital self-funded by [[Jordan]], ~$5M+ in time invested by [[Jordan]] and the network of co-creators. 
	- We estimate that the [[The Starting Point]] would require 4 to 5 years and $40 Million to $50 Million to recreate. 
	- This means that it actually cannot be recreated, because of the rate at which events will unfold throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 
- [[Resource Tranche 2]]: $10M - Summer 2024  
- [[Resource Tranche 3]]: $100M - 2025  
- [[Resource Tranche 4]]: $1 Billion+ - 2026  
- [[Resource Tranche 5]]: During the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], $15 Trillion to $20 Trillion of the $30 Trillion already budgeted for omnicidal World War, redirected to the largest [[Citizen Led]] infrastructure, wellness, and education project in human history, transforming our [[Weapons Into Tools of Life]]. 
- [[Lionsberg Resource Runway]] provides additional detail on the sources and uses of capital and the [[Multi-Phase Poly-Centric Ecosystemic Resourcing Approach]]. 
### Your Role in This Epic Journey

While this document is specifically intended as a Resource Request to generate the next $10M+ in working capital, the world needs *you* far more than the resources you steward. 

We invite you not only contribute, but to set your feet on the path alongside [[The First Three Percent]], helping to mentor and lead this transformation and forge a movement that will shape our individual and collective destinies. 

With $500 Billion of existing annual philanthropic flows, our aim is to redirect the first $10 Million to the [[New Vision and Plan]] this summer, an increase that by at least an [[Order Of Magnitude]] each year. 

Your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is to: 

1. [[Join The Movement]]  
2. Forge or Join a Giving Circle with peers you are inspired by   
3. Make a meaningful initial contribution or investment  
4. Commit to monitoring and resourcing the [[Critical Path]] as the journey unfolds  
5. [[Pass The Flame]] and inspire others to do the same
