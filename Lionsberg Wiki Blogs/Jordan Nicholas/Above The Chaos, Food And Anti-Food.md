# Above The Chaos, Food And Anti-Food

By [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], 2024.01.30 _(updated 2024.01.30)_  

A post in [[Above The Chaos]]  

In the post [[Above The Chaos, 80 Percent of Homes, Schools, and Workplaces are Fostering Chronic Illness]], we covered the mechanics of [[Chronic Inflammation]] as the core driver of [[Chronic Disease]] in more detail, and explained how the [[Immune System]] responds to persistent exposure to environmental toxins. 

One way to make the exposure to toxins far worse is to directly consume them through food and drink. 

The vast majority of our [[Food Systems]] are compromised and producing something akin to [[Anti-Food]] in the name of [[Food]]. 

____

One of the goals of the [[Lionsberg System]] is to articulate and reinstantiate a complete [[Way]] (of living, being, doing), that if we were to [[Embody]] and [[Enact]], would result in the [[Progressive Realization]] of [[The Goal]]. 

This requires sorting out each [[Levels of Abstraction|Level of Abstraction]], from [[Ultimate Reality]], down through the theological, philosophical, theoretical, and into the most basic details and realities of existence, such as [[Food]] and [[Drink]]. 
___

When it comes to the most basic co-operation of our Embodiment, one of the first rules is [[Do Not Harm]]. 

In a sea of virtually infinite inputs, there are many potential pathways towards [[Progressive Realization]] of [[Potential]]. Therefore on the side of the [[Positive]], the theory is something like [[Continuous Learning And Improvement]], with the [[Aim]] being to Become [[A Little Better Every Day]]. There are many potential pathways up the Sacred Mountain. 

Even though [[We Do Not Know]] precisely how to Embody the Highest [[Way]], when it comes to the side of the [[Negative]] or the [[Anti]], we can know what causes unnecessary [[Pain]], [[Suffering]], [[Failure]], and [[Death]] and avoid them. 
____

Therefore one of the first steps on the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]] is to stop poisoning our [[Selves]] with [[Anti-Food]]. 

While that can be accomplished individually with some difficulty and discipline, this will ultimately require a significant bottom up transformation of our [[Food Systems]] ensuring universal availability positive and transformational inputs for all beings, while progressively eliminating the marketing and consumption of toxins and pathogens known to destroy our [[Selves]] and our loved ones.
