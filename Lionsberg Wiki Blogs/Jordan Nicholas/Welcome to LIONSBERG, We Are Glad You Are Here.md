# Welcome to LIONSBERG, We Are Glad You Are Here

**Dear Loved Ones, Allies, and Fellow Builders,**

Welcome to **LIONSBERG**.

We **Love You**. We **Miss You**. Welcome **HOME**.

Everything about [[LIONSBERG]] is, as told in **[[The Story of the Builder]]**, a **[[Work In Progress]]**. This will never be a finished structure—it is a **living, evolving, co-created effort** to **bring Heaven to Earth**, one **step, one decision, one life, one community at a time**. 

We are doing Our best to **download [[The Divine Blueprints]]**, analyze the **[[Existing Forces and Conditions]]**, and map out a **[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan|Strategy and Plan]]** to manifest the **[[Creator's Intent]]** in Reality—**Right Here, Right Now**.

But make no mistake—**the Reality of Heaven on Earth is not something handed down to us from Above.**  
It is something that must be **co-created**, lived, and embodied **Together**.
It is a State of Being that We must **Become**.

It is something that **emerges** through each **individual, circle, team, and locality** as a direct **consequence of Who We Are Becoming**.

LIONSBERG was purpose-built to enable **humanity to win [[The War]] and accomplish [[The Mission]]** within a single generation—but it can only become Reality through the conscious decision to voluntarily accept [[The Invitation]], one individual at a Time.

We are so delighted that you have decided to take this simple yet extraordinary [[First Step]]. 
 
Each and every individual who responds—**as We connect and empower [[The First Three Percent]]**—becomes a **key to unlocking [[Heaven On Earth]]**.

## **A Living, Breathing Battlefield**

As you settle in, you might also notice:

- **The War is raging.** The battle for **Truth, Sovereignty, and The Future** is approaching its peak.
- **There are new species of [[Cosmic Wildlife]] wandering the terrain.** Some are allies, some are neutral, and some are predators and parasites.
- **Just like on a safari in Africa or a trek through the Amazon, it is crucial to keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times**—and **do not touch or interact with anything you do not fully understand.**

Most entities will leave you alone. But there are **predators, parasites, and self-defense mechanisms you do not want to be associated with.**

Everything in LIONSBERG operates on **Sovereignty and Free Will**. Every **Individual, Team, and Community** is **self-governing**, free to act as they see fit **within the bounds of [[Love]], [[Universal Law]]**.

That being said, **we strongly recommend that you wear your [[Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]] at all times** here on **[[Worksite Earth]]** and become highly proficient with **[[Your Weapons]]**. 

Throughout the **[[10 Year Grand Strategy]]**, We can expect to **Co-Create with one hand, while Protecting, Defending, and Destroying in Love with the other.**

This is not a burden—it is the **Refiner’s Fire** that will forge us into the kinds of **Powerful, Competent, Loving, Wise, and Good beings** capable of bringing **Heaven to Earth for millennia to come**.

One of **[[The Watchwords of LIONSBERG]]** is:

### **“Dangerous But Good.”**
