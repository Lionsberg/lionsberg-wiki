Greetings Esteemed Allies, 

Congratulations and thank you for being a part of the successful completion of the first 7 [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] within 7 weeks. 

With that important milestone behind us, [[The Invitation, Cycle 8]] is live. 

It contains a link to a new video shot by Zachary Marlow.

[[The Invitation]] is designed to be improved with each cycle. If you see anything that could be improved, please suggest changes and resources to help implement. 

To advance [[The Movement]] via the collective discernment of the [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]], each individual is invited to extend The Invitation to one other individual a week, and to nominate additional members as you see fit to [[Jordan]] for collective discernment. 

Love and Blessings, 

~ J
