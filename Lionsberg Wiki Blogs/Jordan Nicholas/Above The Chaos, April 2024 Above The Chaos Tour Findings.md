# Above The Chaos, Road Trip Findings

## Purpose 

Following the [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] that ended February 29, 2024 and the extension of the first invitations in March 2024, the purpose of the April road trip / segment 1 of the [[Above The Chaos Tour]] was to find the [[Wise Right People]] to complete Cycle 7 and expand the Lionsberg Movement out to at least 34 committed [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]].

With that [[Milestones|Milestone]] now completed, it is our hope that the tipping point strategy can become self-sustaining as each Co-Creator invites in the right people at the right time as the epic Story unfolds.

			- Begin the propagation of strategic elements of [[The Prototype]] to [[Bioregions]] and [[Watersheds]] around the world.  
- Consider a [[Lionsberg Challenge]]  
	- Drawing on the Buckminster Fuller Challenge model 
	- Drawing on the XPrize model  
		- Or - partner with XPrize 
- Establish a world-class [[Grant Writing Function]] to connect the decentralized array of worthy causes to the abundant resources available  
- Begin networking together [[Resource Stewards]], and guiding their [[Resource Flows]] towards the [[Critical Path]] of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]   
	- [[George Orbelian]]  
	- [[Barbara Merz]]  
	- [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]]  
	- Education and guidance on Critical Path, Waste, Value, et al 
- Further Refine and Embody Communications System 
	- [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]], [[Justin LeBlanc]], [[Peter Kaminski]], [[Day Waterbury]] 
	- Groups communicate in small groups... 
	- Groups slow down to [[Harvest, Curate, and Push]] Signal to the [[Lionsberg Wiki]]  
	- A group synthesizes, composts, and sends the synthesis back out to The Whole

	- 3. [[The Summary]] 
	- The [[The Lionsberg Co-Creator Handbook]] should likely include links to these and other [[Frequently Asked Questions]]

## Frequently Asked Questions 

- After the [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], where are you at? What pieces have been articulated and built? 
	- 1. Thousands of hours of thought and dialogue around [[Worksite Earth]] as Whole to be transformed [[FROM the Old TO the New]] within a single generation. 
	- 2. Articulation of Divine connection, philosophy, theory, and practice via the [[Lionsberg Wiki]] and [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]   
	- 3. Years of full time legal and governance work with dozens of advisors resulting in the instantiation of the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]]. 
	- 4. Creation of a backbone platform to connect and empower the [[Force For Good]]. ~10% of the capabilities surfaced into a user interface under the brand Open Impact brand, and tested with several hundreds groups in 50+ countries in MVP, Alpha, and Beta Phases. Public facing version can be seen at [Open Future Coalition](https://impact.openfuturecoalition.org/marketplace/card-grid). A clean, unpopulated Lionsberg version exists and will be populated in a few weeks when we hit 30 to 40 co-creators and the next major update is pushed. 
	- 5. Creation of the beginning of a collective brain via a Memory for The Movement. This technology underlying the [Lionsberg Wiki](https://lionsberg.wiki) is built intentionally simple and "low to the ground" in anticipation of large sections of the internet being taken down or fire walled. It allows for the decentralized storage, retrieval, and updating of our collective memory of the [[New Vision and Plan]], even during times of crisis. 
	- 6. Travel to dozens of countries and convening of dozens of advisors for over a thousand human-hours of discernment around the [[New Pattern Language]] and the [[New Operating System]].  
- What pieces are still missing? 
- Key Questions 
	- **Networking Question** - how the invitation only strategy invites in the [[Wise Right People]], at the [[Wise Right Time]], for the [[Wise Right Reasons]].  
	- **Timing Question**: How the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] is monitored along the fibonacci unfurling / [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] to move 10 billion people in 10 years to safety, harmony, and coherence in the [[New]]. 
	- **Resourcing Question**: How we get the right [[Resource Stewards]] paying attention, recognizing, and resourcing [[Value Creation]]. 
	- **Internal Awareness Question**: How do we become aware of the good work "out there" that could come "in here" with "Us"?  
		- Use existing filtering across [[The Movement]]... 
		- Identify the trusted [[Grantors]] whose [[Diligence Process]] is likely to surface high quality leaders and projects  
		- Identify the trusted [[Grantees]] whose character and projects are likely to surface high quality [[Grantors]]  
	- **External Awareness Question**: How do people become aware of [[The Movement]]?  
	- **Invitation Question**: How do we create a simple, streamlined, one click [[Lionsberg Invitation]] that is easy, joyful, and inspiring to extend and accept?
	- **First 100 and 1,000 Question**: Who are the first group of 100? Who are the first 1,000? 
	- **3% Question**: Who are the awakened, enlightened, capable, and ready 3% (~250 Million)?  
	- What is our Mother Earth asking from us?  
	- What is our Heavenly Father asking from us?  
	- How do we recognize, restore, and embody the Balance of the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine?  
	- 
- Secondary Questions 
	- Would [[Tom Chi]] be open to collaborating, sharing At One diligence model, and / or offering the [[Lionsberg System]] to the At One entrepreneurial teams? 
	-
