# Curation Example - 'community currency'

_a post in [[Pete's Journal]]_

Over on [[Lionsberg Town Square]], we're having a discussion about [[Curating]], including via [[Hashtags]] and [[Linking]].

I wanted to demonstrate some linking-to-curate in this post, using a simple search for "community currency".

Doing the search in Obsidian, I find the phrase on these pages:

- [[2022.07.05 Request For Guidance]], where it's in the name of a group
- [[Above The Chaos,  2022.07.16 Public Update]], where it's in the name of a group
- [[Currency and Measurement, 2022-07-25]], mentioned in a meeting that Jordan, Forrist, and I had earlier today.
- [[Groups]], where it is again referring to a group

Had this been _real_ curation instead of a demo, this might be where I wax poetic (or expound intelligently, or whatever) about what I observed about the phrase and where it turned up.

Note that in this simple demo, I did a simple search, and just found the exact phrase.  In a real act of curation, I'd probably have a memory of a variety of posts, both in formal "core" pages, and also in informal journal pages, perhaps meeting notes (as above), chats or transcripts, etc.  And it would be not just the exact strings, but I would use my human pattern-matching to pull together related materials, perhaps about economics, recognition of reciprocity, etc.

Note that a curation page like this can also link to Mattermost (or web pages, of course, but I won't demo that):

- a thread starting, [The question of payment inspires two additional questions](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/3ji4e6wy63ngdykuetk7ssm4ir) (csc mattermost)
- Grace mentioning [[Bristol Pound]] / [[Bristol Pay]]: [a discussion of one of the most successful community currency efforts in the world discussing why it failed](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/hxq1mrggrfyummuqjrauzdpzho)
- Grace [getting real about monetary discussion](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/4c3p83uigtymxmymh174c3uiur)
- Spirit kicking off this round of discussion, [Has anyone thought about or doing some work to develop a “currency system” for Meta Project?](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/pb9px79ofpdzdk198cyc8wj4sa)

Upshot:

Pretty easy to do, ties together lots of things in ways that other people can build on.  [[Linking]], one of the true strengths of wiki.
