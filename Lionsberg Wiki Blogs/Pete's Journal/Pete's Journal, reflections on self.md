# Pete's Journal, reflections on self

_a post in [[Pete's Journal]]_

As it turns out, this post is not really about self; rather, it's just an example of how to set up a blog, and a blog post.  "Reflections on self" just seemed like a better title than "Test Page 001".

As I reflect on that, maybe it's a meta-reflection on self.  Ha!
