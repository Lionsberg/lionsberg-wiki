[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]] is live. What was formerly [[The LIONSBERG Co-Creator's Handbook]] has been woven in and retired. 

[[README|The LIONSBERG Wiki Homepage]] now concisely points to  [[The Nameless Book]]... which points to [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]] and Playbook. 

[[Jordan's Short Story]] update and woven with [[LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto]].  

Another major step forward towards accessibility.
