# Something Powerful, New, and Good
*This Series Is The Interim Successor to [[Above The Chaos]]*  

This regenesis is socially awkward and spiritually *Beautiful and Good*.  
There are no remaining expectations. *Tabula Rasa*.  
All previous contracts and agreements have been *Fulfilled by Death*.  
Everyone and everything is free to *Dissociate and Realign*.  

We are attempting to transmit a New Signal as purely as We are able,  
In order to separate wheat from chaff and find *The Resonant Few*.
