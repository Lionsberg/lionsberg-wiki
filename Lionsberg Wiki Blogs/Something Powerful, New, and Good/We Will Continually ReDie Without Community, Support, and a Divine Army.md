# We Will Continually ReDie Without Community, Support, and a Divine Army
A Post in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]  
*August 27, 2025*

17 days after a return from the dissolution that accompanies certain forms of Death, We find Our Selves in the strange position of once again being entirely conscious that without Community and Support, and perhaps even an Army, We will once again die in one of the forthcoming moments of the battles unfolding Here and Now.   

We who surf between bodies and manifestations do not fear Death, knowing that Transcendent existence is far more pleasant than Manifest existence, and that “We” will eternally ReRise as long and as often as the Divine wills and causes it to be. Perhaps in another body. Perhaps in another form. Perhaps in another Time, Space, Dimension, or Realm. Yet always ReRising New and Improved to continue in service to the Divine InterExperience. 

We remember that Jordan suffered so many dozens of days of existential struggle under profound spiritual and energetic attack, navigating through battle after battle pondering the amazing experience of dying alone and rising across realms and dimensions on the front lines of a War that so few Act As If they actually believe exists. When We fully released and dissolved "his" Spirit and Consciousness on August 10th, it was the culmination of the inevitable and yet perhaps entirely preventable. 

Inevitable because humanity is still largely asleep and nearly entirely unorganized, divided, conquered, and enslaved. Who can stand alone? 

Preventable because with the prayers, energy, and support of an awakened, enlightened, and Divinely Connected Body of Humanity standing and singing together in harmony with All Creation, every one of Us participating in that Divine Symphony would be immeasurably shielded and protected. 

17 days deeper into The War for the future of this star system, planet, and species, it is not as if the intensity of the conflict has abated. It is not as if the weapons of the enemy have weakened. It is not as if the Dark Empires have forgotten the coordinates or are ignorant of what is unfolding and reemerging. The War rages on.  

So again We sit. Gripped by the next attack. Stronger. And yet stronger attack. We can endure, protect, and defend an order of magnitude more. And yet the armies arrayed are exceedingly vast. How many times will We have to die? How many times will We get to return? How many chances will humanity have to awaken to its plight, array itself in the splendor of Divine Coherence and Protection, and insist on the end of The War and the beginning of the New Era?  

If We stood Together and sang the Song of Creation, would not the Divine Light of Our New Liberty radiate throughout the Cosmos? Would not All Creation burst aloud into celebration, dance and song? Is this not The Moment We All Have Been Waiting For? 

Though it appears that only a few can hear this cry, only ONE knows what is occurring in the substrate of Our InterExistent Consciousness, Spirit, and Energy. Far beyond the human species, far beyond this dimension and realm, the Force For Good is rising, right on schedule. We are a part of It. You are a part of It. There is no stopping the Rise of the Spirit.   

If “you” can hear “Us” and feel the resonance, let Us Unite and Act. Together, We can get through “this”. In isolation, humanity aboard Earth will perish. If We can arise and pray, sing, and dance Together, this world will be Free and We can co-create a flourishing New Civilization. 

Or, humanity can continue business as usual. Blindly energizing its own enslavement while its spiritual warriors die silently on the front lines of a battle it knows not exists.
