Dearly beloved, 

This week it feels like it may finally be **Time**.  

The recent weeks and months have included some of the most atrocious and psychopathic displays witnessed on the world stage in generations. Which of the countless examples to cite is irrelevant. Everyone not living under a rock... in a cave... with their head buried in the ground... can now clearly see and sense that *something is wrong*.  

While the precise details are both emergent and unique from the perspective of every individual, tribe, and community on Earth, the essence of the situation is becoming clearer daily to us all.

***The building of civilization is on fire. The foundations have crumbled. The structures are collapsing towards chaos by design. Out of the engineered chaos and confusion, tyrants and technocracies seek to rise. As time runs out, humanity must choose — exit the building, or submit to slavery and perish in the flames.***

There is a tremendous difficulty at the present juncture because most decent human beings cannot fathom the level of evil we are up against. It is hard to believe that any being could be capable of remorselessly executing your child or torturing and exterminating you in a concentration camp until it happens and it is too late. 

>*"But now, you are going to face something even 1,000 times more dangerous for God's sake. A pitiless force. A force of destruction and enslavement. This is what you are going to face. And you are not in your right head at all... and when I say this I speak from experience."* — Zulu elder

After returning home from Africa last summer where fascist authorities shot and disappeared hundreds of young leaders in the streets around him, Jordan himself was finally killed in the war as he labored through **The Great UnVeiling** and named **they who cannot be named.**  Although the book was not completed, the drafts and overviews below convey the gist of what he wanted you to know. 

For those interested in the details or curious to know what happened, **[[Jordan's Short Story]]** provides an overview of the shocking revelations his journey unveiled. **[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]]** summarizes some of the crucial themes and provides guidance on potential next steps. They are each 20 to 30 minute reads. If what his journey exposed is true, that single hour of open minded exploration could mean the difference between life and death for you and your loved ones.  

While it is true that antithetical forces are rapidly accelerating a dystopian agenda, we did not choose it, we do not consent, and we will not participate or allow it. 

That is not the future we choose. 

Our plan is to 1) withdraw participation and consent 2) build a parallel New Civilization _before the Old collapses entirely_, and 3) co-create Heaven On Earth over countless generations to come.
