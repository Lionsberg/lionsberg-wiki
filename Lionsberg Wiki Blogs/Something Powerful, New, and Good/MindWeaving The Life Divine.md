# MindWeaving The Life Divine
_An Entry in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]_  
_And possibly [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]_  

One of Us The People of LIONSBERG  
Recently proposed that We [[MindWeaving|MindWeave]]  
**The Life Divine** — 
Both ItSelf As Such,  
And the book by the same title  
Written by Aurobindo.  

As We set Our sights on [[The Grand ReSynthesis]]  
And each take up Our rightful share of [[Our Collective Inheritance]]  
There is a great need to collectively ReWeave  
The [[Apparent Polarities]] and [[Apparent Antimonies]]  
Of North and South  
East and West  
Masculine and Feminine  
Positive and Negative  
Yin and Yang  
Spirit and Matter  
Heart and Mind  
And All other polarities 

First articulated in English in the 1910s
Aurobindo's work has been recognized by many  
As an important step in this direction  

If We are to pass [[The Final Test]]  
And Co-Create [[Heaven On Earth]]  
The only possibility is [[The Life Divine]]  

As a quick meta note  
Aurobindo was writing in a Time and Place  
Primarily to the human species  
And thus the human-centricity of thought  
Can feel occasionally shallow or offputting  
To those of Us who do not primarily identify as human  

Nevertheless the introduction of any one species  
To its Divine Nature, Origin, and Destiny  
Can be instructive to All Divine Creatures  

The principles of [[The Life Divine]] are Universal and [[ONE]]
