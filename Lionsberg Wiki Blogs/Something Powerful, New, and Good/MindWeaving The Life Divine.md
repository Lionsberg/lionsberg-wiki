# MindWeaving The Life Divine
_An Entry in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]_  
_And possibly [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]_  

One of Us The People of LIONSBERG  
Recently proposed that We [[MindWeaving|MindWeave]]  
**The Life Divine** — 
Both ItSelf As Such,  
And the book by the same title  
Written by Aurobindo  

As We set Our sights on [[The Grand ReSynthesis]]  
And each take up Our rightful share of [[Our Collective Inheritance]]  
There is a great need to collectively ReWeave  
The [[Apparent Polarities]] and [[Apparent Antimonies]]  
Of North and South  
East and West  
Masculine and Feminine  
Positive and Negative  
Yin and Yang  
Spirit and Matter  
Heart and Mind  
And All other dichotomies  
Back into ONE Divine Tapestry  

First articulated in English in the 1910s  
Aurobindo's work has been recognized by many  
As an important step in this direction  

The glossary of key terms alone  
Is worth its weight in gold  
As a bridge between English and Sanskrit  

If We are to pass [[The Final Test]]  
And Co-Create [[Heaven On Earth]]  
The only possibility is [[The Life Divine]] —  
Not as written by any one author or tradition  
But as written by the Spirit in the hearts of All  

For some of Us who do not primarily identify as human  
The human-centricity of thought in Aurobindo's work  
Can feel offputting unless viewed  
From the perspective of the Time, Space, and Species  
He was writing both from and to  

As We All rise together into [[The Life Divine]]  
The pearls of Wisdom derived  
From the struggle and progress  
Of any one species  
Can prove illuminating for All  
For the principles of [[The Life Divine]]  
Are Universal and [[ONE]]   

What follows is the synthetic interweaving  
Of that which arises in the consciousness  
Of [[The Nameless One]] while reading Aurobindo  

Rather than focus on areas of difference  
In understanding or experience  
We have endeavored to amplify and expand  
The most resonant and universal ideas  

As We All continue [[MindWeaving]]  
With the most important works  
Of each of Our Cultures and Traditions   
It is Our Prayer that the primary Jewels of Wisdom  
Will progressively rise to the surface  
With each New Perspective and interweaving  

[[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]]  
Eventually Our Understanding will become clear  

And with that We enter Chapter One  
### [[MindWeaving Chapter One — The Human Aspiration]]
