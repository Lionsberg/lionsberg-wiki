# An Invitation Into 2026 and Beyond

_This invitation attempts to bridge the stories_  
_Of J, humanity, and **What's Next**_  
_Into a coherent starting point_  
_For our shared adventure_  
_Into the extraordinary times ahead_  

___

J's violent death in August  
Threw a disorienting discontinuity  
Into every significant relationship  
He was a part of  

Adopting and healing his body  
And stabilizing his relationships  
Has been an extraordinary experience  
Both as difficult and misunderstood  
As the last seven years of his life    

Having dropped directly into a contested body  
In the war for the future of Earth  
We remain under continuous attack  
By the same forces that killed J  
And thousands of others this summer  

We know not whether this new experience   
Of embodied life and consciousness  
Will persist indefinitely or abruptly end today  

Either Way **_the future is good_**  
And **_it depends upon you_**  

_Please accept the following invitation and offering_  
_Only if it resonates and you feel called_  
_The Quest will not be easy_  

____

On its Quest towards Destiny  
Humanity now faces a challenge  
Unlike any in the last 10,000 years  

As the veil tears  
And the robes of the rulers are rended  
The reality of the Earth's enslavement  
By a dark and ancient empire  
Is bursting into view for All to see  

_At present humanity is neither self-governing nor free_  

The events of 2026 to 2033  
Will shape the trajectory of Earth  
For thousands of years to come  

The vast majority of timelines  
Cascade towards extinction level events  
And centuries of chaos and tyranny  

**_But We do not choose those futures_** 

Many of Us are here on Earth _for this_  
And We can and will prevail Together  

**_We have been to The Future and it is Good_**  
**_Heaven on Earth is at hand_**  

But first We must face the harshest realities  
Of **The Chasm** that stands between  
**Where We Are** and **Where We Are Going**  
And the forces that stand in Our Way  

____

As We ponder the impossible expanse  
Stretching out before awestruck eyes  
The dark creeping fog breaks  
And the faint outline of an ancient bridge  
Emerges into view  

A luminous and striking figure appears  
Smiling and extending a loving hand of fellowship  

>_"Greetings, Dear Children of Earth_  
>_Welcome_  
>_Do not be afraid_  

>_We have been waiting for you_  
>_And now, precisely on schedule_  
>_You have arrived_"  

His voice is like the sound of deep rushing waters  
His eyes like those that gaze across worlds  

As the mist clears a little more  
Your attention comes to rest  
On the ancient words blazing like fire  
Over the entrance to **The Bridge**  

>_THIS IS THE WAY_  
>_Walk ye in it_  
>_Towards Heaven on Earth_  
>_And Beyond_
