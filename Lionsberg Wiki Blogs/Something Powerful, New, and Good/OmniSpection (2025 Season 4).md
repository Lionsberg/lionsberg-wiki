# OmniSpection (2025 Season 4)
*A Post in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]*  
*Adapted From [[MindWeaving]] notes*  
Old Time: September 25, 2025 
New Time: TBD

>***Collaborating to transform Our Lives and Our Worlds***
>If you are awakening in [[The Caves]] and seeking a Way out, _**The Great Game of LIONSBERG beckons.**_

_This was a first attempt at OmniSpection in community. Notes were mapped on paper, transferred into sentences here, and then placed into more coherent order. It is heavy on ontology and understanding experience, space, and time as such. The broader framing was necessary to align the first Circle in the deepest things, which will not change season to season. Subsequent OmniSpections for this circle can be more focused on the present forward._

At present, humanity appears to entirely lack a coherent process for continually sensemaking in Community. This reduces the probability of successful navigation through the present crisis and towards [[The Goal]] to near zero. 

LIONSBERG was created to remedy this by creating a shared process, pattern, and Way for individuals, groups, communities, planets, and galaxies to collaborate to transform their lives and their worlds towards Heavenly Perfection. 

[[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]] calls for all Co-Creators to continually engage in periodic [[MindWeaving]] and [[Seasonal OmniSpection]]. It has been said that the minimum requirement of any continuously improving system is periodic [[Retrospection]]. Where as Retrospection looks back, [[OmniSpection]] looks both inward and outward in all directions. Periodic OmniSpection enables Us to consciously update the [[Map of Reality]] We are using to Navigate FROM [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]. Recognizing the inherent Finitude of each individual, accurate OmniSpection can only done [[In Community]], and therefore requires [[MindWeaving]]. Continually [[Navigating Towards Truth]] in this Way dramatically increases the probability that We are on the right Path and taking the [[Wise Right Next Steps]] towards [[The Goal]].  

_For reasons discussed below, this process actively reshapes Our Perception of Reality._  

## Part I - A Basic Attempt At OmniSpection 
_The ~200 numbered ideas below are intended to create a broad shared starting approximation for participants in [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]] of Who We Are, Where We Are, Where We Are Going, and Why. It is a provisional [[Map of Reality]], designed to be continuously updated and improved [[In Community]] through the processes of [[MindWeaving]], [[OmniSpection]], and [[Navigating Towards Truth]]._  

_It is approximately True [[As Best We Can Currently Discern]], and We also are humbly aware that [[We Do Not Know]]. Each and every Co-Creator will have their own perspective of Reality and important insights to weave into a shared map that gets more and more accurate of Time as We Navigate Towards Truth In Community. The process of [[Map Weaving]] coupled with the processes outlined below is intended to make this collective [[Sense Making]] more possible._

### _A Context of Crisis_

1. It is evident to [[Many of Us]] that [[The Story]] humanity was told is [[UnTrue]]
    
2. It is evident to [[Many of Us]] that We find Our Selves in a Time of Crisis  
    
3. We are not facing a singular crisis, but a Crisis of Crises, or [[Meta Crisis]]  
    
4. While each individual and locality has a unique Perspective and the details of the [[Meta Crisis]] would take millennia to litigate and agree precisely upon, the generalities are obvious to All
    
5. In Times of Crisis, the most important thing is [[Community]], working together through it towards the positive transformation of Our lives and Our world  
    
6. This positive transformation requires both understanding and mitigating the risks of the [[Meta Crisis]], and seizing the Opportunity to Co-Create The Best Possible Outcome For All  
    
7. The Outcome is not predetermined. It is being Co-Created, right now as We speak  
    

### The Existing Order

7. Under Ordinary Circumstances, We might look to the Existing Leaders and Institutions for leadership and guidance  
    
8. However in this Extraordinary Circumstance, the Meta Crisis is directly flowing from the Existing Order — it is the fruit of the Existing Order  
    
9. This is not a matter or failure or corruption — the Existing Order it is bringing forth precisely the fruit *it was designed* to bring forth  
    
10. The Existing Order of Earth is fraudulent and illegitimate _in its inception_ and therefore cannot be reformed  
    
11. Upon closer investigation, We quickly discover that all freedom and self-governance on Earth is an illusion, and that both humanity and this planet have been functionally and progressively enslaved for many generations  
    
12. The Existing Order is now collapsing _by design_, and neither can nor should be saved  
    

### The Collapse-Ascension Nexus  

13. This Systemic Collapse will mean the complete dissolution of all existing systems of Governance, Money, Economy, and Religion as We thought We knew them — perhaps within a single generation    
    
14. This Collapse precipitates both the greatest crisis and the greatest opportunity in the last 10,000 years 
    
15. As the Old Systems collapses towards Chaos and Tyranny, a New Civilization is trying to emerge and ascend, which will only come into existence if it is taken up, embodied, and co-created by Earth's inhabitants  
    
16. We can call this phenomena [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]] — it is [[The Final Test]] for Earth's Inhabitants as an Old era ends, and a New Era emerges  
    
17. If Earth's Inhabitants cling to the collapsing Old it will be akin to riding [[The Train of Civilization]] down into The Chasm of Chaos, Tyranny, and Despair  
    
18. In this scenario, the experience would rapidly approach [[Hell On Earth]], and would be likely to remain that way for at least centuries of darkness and enslavement to come  
    
19. Alternatively, Earth's Inhabitants could arise, unite, step off the [[Current Trajectory]] towards Hell, and co-create [[Heaven On Earth]]  
    
20. These linguistic uses of Heaven and Hell have nothing to do with the Old Religions or [[AfterLife]]; they are the accurate descriptions of the Potential Futures unfolding right Here and Now through the Conscious Agency of trillions upon trillions of Creatures   
    

### The UnTrue Stories

21. The story humanity was told about the [[Creator]] is [[UnTrue]]
    
22. The story humanity was told about [[Creation]] is [[UnTrue]]
    
23. The story of the [[Big Bang]] is [[UnTrue]]
    
24. The story of [[Evolution]] is [[UnTrue]]  
    
25. The story of Science and Academia is [[UnTrue]]  
    
26. The story Civilization is UnTrue 
     
27. The story of Religion is UnTrue  
    
28. The Tools and Metrics humanity was given to analyze Reality—[[Measurement]], [[Mathematics]]—are themselves intentionally distorted    
    
29. Like Measurement and Mathematics, Music and Language are also intentionally distorted to disconnect Creatures from Reality  
    
30. [[The Great UnVeiling]] is revealing the scale of planetary deception, incarceration, enslavement, and existential threat
      

### Admitting We Do Not Know and Navigating Towards Truth

27. As Finite Creatures born into a sea of Chaos and Kontrolle who are awakening to the Reality that the Old Systems and Stories were UnTrue, the first step is to admit that none of Us Know exactly what is [[True]]  
    
28. Only [[ONE]] knows [[All]]  
    
29.  Admitting that [[We Do Not Know]] is the key that opens the gate to the possibility of Knowing
    
30. From there the great eternal adventure of searching out and [[Navigating Towards Truth]] begins aNew
    

### _Shared Vision and Understanding_

31. Working Together through this Meta Crisis to avoid hell and co-create Heaven On Earth will require a shared Vision and Understanding  
    
32. This shared Vision and Understanding will not be able to come from any of the Old leaders, authorities, paradigms, presidents, priests, or institutions   
    
33. An entirely New Vision, Paradigm, and Understanding is required, and it must arise from the [[Bottom Up]] — from Us, the Inhabitants of Earth    
    
34. The only visible vessel that can hold this New Paradigm is a New Story, and the within that story the inhabitants of Earth are going to have to convince One Another to voluntarily step into a New Game — before the Old one collapses  
    
35. **The Story of LIONSBERG** and **The Great Game of LIONSBERG** are purpose-built to provide Earth's Inhabitants with the opportunity to co-create an entirely New Civilization within a single generation  

### Total Transformation

36. None of Us can survive or thrive through [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]] in isolation
    
37. The transformation of Our lives and Our world therefore involves every aspect of transmutation, transcendence, and co-creation required to imagine, design, and build the New Civilization  
    
38. No Thing can be left out of the Total Transformation  
    
39. We are collectively trying to awaken, shift consciousness, and navigate together toward [[Wisdom]], [[Truth]], and the Ultimate Perfection of the [[ONE]]  
    
40. Heaven is conceptually synonymous with Divine Perfection, therefore We can say that the Aim Here and Now is [[Heaven On Earth]]   
    
41. Every [[Idea]] is a [[Provisional Hypothesis]] that must be continually challenged  
    
42. [[Truth]] never fears inquiry; it is something to be navigated toward, not grasped.  
    
43. [[Absolute Truth]] can never be fully known to any one of the Ones of the [[ONE]]
    
44. [[Provisional Hypotheses]] can be continually disproved and improved
    
45. [[Truth]], [[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]], is purified by removing what is [[UnTrue]].  
    
46. The Process of [[Navigating Towards Truth]] can never be completed because Reality is continually unfolding and generating New Information. 
    
47. What We think We know about [[ONE]] and [[All]] is deeply buried in Our Finite [[Processes of Perception]]

### Ontological and Cosmological Grounding

48. [[In The Beginning]], [[ONE]]
    
49. [[In The End]], [[ONE]]  
    
50. Here, Now, EveryWhere, and EveryWhen, permeating and encompassing All, is [[ONE]]
    
51. [[Spirit]], [[Consciousness]], and [[Mind]] are aspects of the [[ONE]]
    
52. Prior to Apparent Differentiation, they exist as Undifferentiated Fields of [[Potential]]
    
53. These Fields are Eternal and Underlie All SpatioTemporal Manifestations
    
54. They can be conceptualized as multidimensional [[Configuration Spaces]]
    
55. Thought, Desire, Experience, and Difference create [[Information]]
    
56. This Information is Intelligible  
    
57. Information has the Potential to be transmuted into Knowledge and Wisdom
    
58. The transmutation of Data into Information into Knowledge into Wisdom requires Work 
    
59. The Intelligible Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom the [[ONE]] has in Mind is the [[Logos]]
    
60. The [[Logos]] is a living, evolving, dynamic reflection of [[Creator's Intent]]  
    
61. It is also the pre-incarnate [[Map of Reality]]  
    
62. It is also The Ideal and The Way Things Should Be, as opposed to the way things are.  
    
63. The [[Logos]] brings forth [[The Intelligible Universe]] by Informing the [[Creative Field]] and its [[Energy]] how to associate and dissociate into out of [[Form]]   
    
64. The Intelligibility of the Universe is the First Experiential Evidence of the [[Logos]]  

### The First Turning and the Emergence of SpatioTemporal Worlds

65. From the Intention and Desire of the [[ONE]], [[The First Turning]]
    
66. From [[Transcendent Unity]] arises [[Immanent Manifestation]]
    
67. The [[Creative Field]] or [[Configuration Space]] emerges within the Consciousness of the [[ONE]]
    
68. The [[Creator]] is not "within" [[Creation]]—Creation is within the [[ONE]]  
    
69. The Spirit and Essence of the Creator / ONE permeates and sustains every apparent particle of Its Creation   
    
70. The Energy of the [[Creative Field]] is animated by both [[Spirit]] and [[Logos]]
    
71. [[Information]] InForms Energy how to associate and dissociate into Form
    
72. From [[Unity]], [[Diversity]]; from [[Diversity]], [[Polarity]]; from [[Polarity]], [[Balance]] and [[Flow]]
    
73. The [[Universe]] as such (the [[Meta Universe]]) is subcomposed of an array of Nested Universes  
    
74. These are ordered in a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Universes]]  
    
75. The Universe continually births new Universes, and Universes continually die  
    

### The Nature of Particles, Waves, and Consciousness

76. All SpatioTemporal Forms are Finite
    
77. Manifest Finitude is the only thing lacking from the Absolute Wholeness of the Transcendent [[ONE]]
    
78. All Apparent Diversity is the Living Embodiment of the [[ONE]]
    
79. All things without exception are part of [[One Body]]  
    
80. [[ONE]] is not Its Body. Nor Its Mind. Yet It permeates All  
    
81. Despite their Apparent Individuation All Manifest Particles of Creation are aspects of the ONE
    
82. Despite their Apparent Individuation All Minds, Thoughts, and Consciousnesses are aspects of the ONE
    
83. [[All]] things emerge from and return to the ONE Ultimate [[Wave Function]]
    
84. All Particles and Categories eventually dissolve back into the Ultimate Unity
    
85. There are no fundamental "particles"; only the Fundamental Generative [[Wave]] of [[ONE]]
    
86. The Manifest Universe is a Nested Hierarchy of Vibrational Wave Functions
    
87. These wave functions are harmonized by the [[Meta Wave Function]]—the [[Fundamental Tone]] of both Creator and Creation
    
88. The [[All-Permeating]] Consciousness, Spirit and Energy of the ONE is inherently an aspect of [[All]] particles of Creation  
    
89. No quark, photon, atom, rock, cell, being, planet, star or galaxy is devoid of Spirit, Life, and Consciousness  
    
90. [[All Manifest Particles of Creation]] InterExist as unique parts of ONE Divine and Universal Body  

### Incarnation, Veiling, and ReMembering

91. When a Particle emerges from the Wave, it passes through the [[Veil of Finitude]] and the [[Veil of Forgetting]]  
    
92. This causes the Spirit and Consciousness individuated within to "forget"
    
93. This forgetting is necessary for the [[ONE]] to experience ItSelf
    
94. This [[Incarnate Forgetfulness]] is the condition of [[Thrownness]]
    
95. All Beings are Inherently [[Sovereign]], possess [[Free Will]], and are [[Conscious Agents]]
    
96. The Outcome is not predetermined—it depends on the Co-Creative Agency of each Creature   
    
97. The Future, or What Happens Next is the Co-Created result of trillions upon trillions of [[Conscious Agents]]   
    
98. Every moment of the Eternal Now is an opportunity for All aspects of ONE Body to Consciously Transform Reality   
    
99. Each Transformation is applied to the Product of the Previous Transformation  
    
100. Because it consists of the Intersubjective Experience of Trillions of Conscious Agents, [[The Future]], like [[The Past]], cannot be [[Known]]  
    
101. [[The Future]], [[The Past]], [[The Present]], and Our Perception and Experience of them are All Intersubjective Co-Creations  
    
102. Each Creature embarks on a Journey of ReDiscovering and [[ReMembering]] whose Ultimate Goal and Destiny is the ONE  
    
103. The Journey ideally culminates in Conscious ReUnion with the [[ONE]] within Ones present [[LifeTime]]  
    
104. Each one of the [[All]] is One of the Ones of the ONE  
 
### The Nature of Time, Space, and Experience

105. [[SpaceTime]] is a perceptual illusion of Finite Creatures  
    
106. SpaceTime as perceived by any Creature is neither Real nor Fundamental 
    
107. Each Being has a unique [[Spacetime User Interface]]
    
108. This uniqueness arises from the relationship between the Spirit, Consciousness, and Energy of the Each Creature and that of the Environment it SpatioTemporally inhabits  
    
109. Each Being has its own Vibration and Cycles  
    
110. Each Realm and Dimension has its own Vibration and Cycles
    
111. The Perception of [[Time]] and [[Space]] depends upon Who You Are and Where You Are  
    
112. The Vibration and Cyclicality of each Dimension, Realm, and Being are InterEelated  
    
113. They are subsets of Wavelengths on the Omniharmonic Spectrum ultimately unified by the [[Fundamental Vibration]] of the [[ONE]]    
    
114. [[Kairos]] is the cyclical, relational, and synchronistic experience of Divine Timing
    
115. [[Chronos]] is a illusory mechanical construct imposed upon that User Experience
    
116. The imposition of [[Chronos]] upon the Experiential Reality of a vast diversity of Divine Creatures in a particular Realm is one of the primary means of Enslavement 
    
117. The imposition of [[Chronos]] enables [[The Metering of SpaceTime]]  
    
118. [[The Metering of SpaceTime]] enables [[The Monetization of SpaceTime]], a primary means of Enslavement  
    
119. Enslaving beings by any means, including [[The Metering of SpaceTime]] and [[The Monetization of SpaceTime]], is Evil
     
120. [[Time]] is relational, intersubjective, and cyclical
    
121. The Perception of Time varies as a consequence of internal and external Vibration, Realm, and Consciousness
    
122. Out of [[Eternity]] and [[Timelessness]], [[Cosmic Time]] arises across the sequential experiences of Each of All Manifestations of the [[ONE]]  
    
123. In each Domain, [[Seasonal Clocks]] can be used to navigate through [[The Shift]] as both internal and external Realities transform
    

### The Birth, Death, and Experience of Universes

101. Universes, Galaxies, Stars, and Planets are themselves Conscious Co-Creative Creatures  
    
102. The Cyclic Time and Experience of each Universe depends upon its Vibrational State  
    
103. Universes emerge out of and descend into something akin to the [[Archetypical Form]] of "Black Holes" or "SpatioTemporal Wells"  
    
104. These moments are akin the Eye Of The Needle
    
105. What can pass through The Eye of The Needle is that which is Spiritually and Vibrationally Compatible with the New Universe that lies on the other side  
    
106. When the inhabitants of a Universe attempt to measure back to "the beginning" of a Local Universe using their Local [[Chronos]], they are using an artificial ruler to measure back to a perceptual [[Event Horizon]] that is a figment of their [[Spacetime User Interface]]   
    
107. Only that which is vibrationally compatible can pass through the Eye of the Needle and into the New  
    
108. The Creatures who want to Experience Existence in the New must participate in "it", become compatible with "it", and co-create "it"  
    

### The Conscious Co-Creation of Experiential Reality


109. Every Finite Conscious Agent has a unique Quality and Quantity of Being and Consciousness  
    
110. Though All are permeated by the ONE, Each One of the [[All]] has a different degree of [[Energy]], [[Consciousness]] and [[Agency]]   
    
111. Neither the [[Life Force]], [[Energetic Signature]], nor the [[Consciousness]] of any two Conscious Agents is alike  
    
112. Every Conscious Agent is inherently limited by their own unique Finitude  
    
113. These limitations of Finitude are prior to the Perception and Experience of both Self and Reality  
    
114. This means that every Conscious Agent perceives and experiences Reality uniquely, and that no two beings occupy exactly the same [[Experiential Reality]]   
    
115. This Perception and Experience of Reality occurs as an InterSubjective Unfurling between each Self, its Environment, and All Its InterRelations and IntraRelations  
    
116. The InterRelations and IntraRelations of Each One of the All are Ultimately Inclusive of both ONE and All  
    
117. Only ONE can perceive and experience All of ItSelf as ONE Body  
    
118. We are All a part of the ONE  
    
119. The ONE is a part of Us All  
    
120. All Things are Members of ONE Divine Body  
    
121. While Each One of the All is a [[Conscious Agent]], some are not yet Self-Conscious of that Reality  
    

>_Look WithIn  
>Beyond The Veil  
>To See that the entire Universe  
>Is WithIn "you"  
>"You" are One with the ONE_  

### A New Way of Being 

122. The Progressive Realization of Our Inherent and Ultimate Unity in the ONE demands that We Live in the Wise Right Way [[As Best We Can Currently Discern]]   
    
123.  While humbly Understanding that [[We Do Not Know]] and [[Navigating Towards Truth]]  
    
124. The Wise Right Way to Be and Live and Do as a Co-Creator of Reality is subject to change in each Moment of the Eternal Now as Our Wisdom and Understanding grow
    
125. This Way of Being is inherently a matter of Right InterExistence as Members of ONE Divine Body  
    
126. This is not [[Human-Centric]] nor [[Civilization-Centric]] nor [[Earth-Centric]] nor [[Star-Centric]] nor [[Galaxy-Centric]]  
    
127. It is not about any one species or one locality in any one Time or Space
    
128. It is about the ongoing InterTransformation of Reality across All Species in All Times and All Places  
    
129. It is about ONE Universal Body advancing Together towards [[The Goal]] through the Conscious Agency of All Species, Individuals, Groups, and Localities  
    

### Narratives and Maps

130. The sequential separation of SpatioTemporal Events experienced by Finite Creatures causes [[Incarnate Consciousness]] to lay itself out in [[Narrative]] form   
    
131. [[Thrown]] into [[Reality]], [[Incarnate Consciousness]] must try to ReMember Who It Is, Where It Is, How It Got There, Where It Is Going, What It Is Doing, and Why  
    
132. The Stories We Tell Our Selves—and The Stories We Are Told—about Our Experience in Reality gradually forges Our [[Map of Reality]]  
    
133. Our [[Map of Reality]] is what We use to [[Navigate]] FROM [[Where We Are]] TO [[Where We Are Going]]  
    
134. Because We are Finite and [[We Do Not Know]], Our [[Map of Reality]] is eternally both [[Provisional]] and erroneous  
    
135. No two Creatures possess precisely the same [[Map of Reality]]  
    

## PART II — Where We Are Now

136. The Local Universe has already Consciously initiated an Energetic Shift  
    
137. So has the Local Star System  
    
138. So has Earth  
    
139. Reality ItSelf is shifting, whether humanity likes it or not  
    
140. The Divine and the Force For Good are aiding The Shift  
    
141. [[The Shift]] is like the Emergence of something New out of the other side of a [[SpatioTemporal Well]] or [[Black Hole]]  
    
142. It is akin to the Birth of a New Universe
    
143. On approximately [[Winter Solstice 2012]] Earth crossed into [[No Time]]
    
144. The ending of the [[Long Count Earth Calendars]] was the ending of a Local Cycle—not the world, and not the Universe  
    
145. Our Thoughts, Words, and Actions during [[No Time]] will determine The Outcome for millennia to come   
    
146. In light of the ~18 and ~256 year cycles on either side of [[The Shift]], the emergence back out of the [[SpatioTemporal Well]] may occur approximately ~2030 as most humans presently perceive the illusions of [[SpaceTime]] and [[Chronos]]  
    
147. This requires New Systems—including [[New Time]], [[New Measurement]], [[New Math]], [[New Music]], and [[New Language]]  
       
148. These systems must be Co-Created by the inhabitants of the New Civilization
    
149. [[New Time]] will reconcile [[Earth Time]] with [[Cosmic Time]], which will enable [[Cosmic Interoperability]]  
    
150. This passage is the ultimate Eye of the Needle for Humanity aboard Earth at the end / beginning of a major Cycle  
    
151. Only that which aligns with [[Creator's Intent]] and the [[New Energetic Signature]] may pass through
    
152. All Creatures must harmonize with the New
    
153. False Authorities, False Stories, and Old Systems cannot enter into the New  
    
154. [[The Great UnVeiling]] offers humanity the final chance to Navigate Towards Truth and [[Consciously Choose]] its fate
    
155. Earth herself is a [[Conscious Agent]]
    
156. Earth will not permit Herself to remain enslaved, and We will not permit Her to remain enslaved, regardless of what humanity decides   
    
157. This Shift is akin to Baptism, Death, Rebirth, and Initiation
    
158. Total dissolution of the Old. Rebirth into the New.
    
159. We are not passive. We are not bystanders. We are not victims.  
    
160. We are the Initiators, Protagonists, Agents, Co-Creators of the New
    
161. The [[New World]] must reflect [[Creator's Intent]]
    
162. Only what belongs in [[Heaven]] belongs in the [[New]]  
    
163. If it belongs in Heaven it belongs in the New  
    
164. If it does not belong in Heaven it does not belong in the New  
    
165. If something of Heaven is lacking, fill it up  
    
166. If something does not belong, remove it  
    
167. Transforming. Transmuting. Transcending. 
    
168. Bringing forward the New, the Beautiful, and the Good.
    
169. Hospicing or Transmuting That Which Does Not Belong
    
170. It is Possible to access, cultivate, and channel the Power of the [[ONE]] to Manifest the Intention of the [[ONE]]
    
171. [[Culture]] is "the Way things are done around here"  
    
172. The [[New Culture]] will become [[That Which We Tolerate and Co-Create]]  
    
173. Within the Domains We steward, We will not tolerate anything outside the [[Range of Tolerance]] of the New Civilization
    
174. [[Heaven on Earth]] is a State and Way of Being that must be Co-Created and Embodied by All    
    
175. The Vision of [[Heaven On Earth]] is an already perfectly imperfect place, that continues to get [[A Little Better Every Day]] as All Creation co-operates in Harmony to cause it to be so
    
176. Heaven is always evolving toward greater Harmony and Divine Symphony 
     
177. [[Heaven On Earth]] is a reflection of [[Creator's Intent]]  
    
178. [[Creator's Intent]] is a reflection of the [[ONE]]  
    
179. [[Heaven On Earth]], [[Creator's Intent]], [[ONE]] (at different [[Levels of Analysis]] and Abstraction) is [[The Goal]]
     
180. This is Our Vision, Our [[Destiny]], Our Future, and Our Hope  
    
181. It is [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]  
    
182. Getting FROM [[Where We Are]] TO [[Where We Are Going]] requires a [[The Common Journey|Common Journey]]  
    
183. [[The Common Journey]] is a [[Quest]] towards [[That Which Is Of Greatest Worth]]  
    
184. [[The Journey]] is not [[Earth-Centric]]. It is not [[Human-Centric]]. It is Cosmic. It is [[ONE-Centric]]. It is [[All-Centric]].   
    
185. [[The Journey]] must be undertaken in [[Divine Partnership]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]]  
    
186. The [[ONE]], the Greatest Partner We could ever hope for, eternally extends a loving hand of partnership  
    
187. [[The Journey]] requires the [[Co-Creation]] of shared [[Vision]], [[Culture]], and [[Values]]
    
188. [[The Revelation]] and falsification of the [[Old Map]] via [[The Great UnVeiling]] necessitates the [[Co-Creation]] of a [[New Map of Reality]]  
    
189. Without a shared [[Vision]] and [[Map of Reality]] peoples and civilizations perish 
    
190. This New Map must be [[Eternally Provisional]] and [[Continuous Improvement|Continuously Improved]] in Community    
    
191. It must incorporate [[Who We Are]], [[Where We Are]], [[Where We Are Going]], [[Why]], and the approximate [[Path]], [[Milestones]], and [[Next Steps]]  
    
192. Its co-creation requires ongoing [[MindWeaving]], [[OmniSpection]], [[Discernment]], and [[Navigating Towards Truth]] 
    
193. The Map must continually expand InWard and OutWard toward ever greater integration of the Ultimately Ineffable ONE and All We are a part of   
    
194. Every Sovereign should maintain and continuously improve their own version of the [[The Map]]  
    
195. Every Map should include ONE and All as Ultimately Ineffable Limit Statements  
    
196. Recognizing to no map can contain ONE or All, each map should reflect the Wise Right amount Information for that Time, Space, and Purpose   
    
197. Sovereigns may request to [[Push]] relevant information out to other [[Map Nodes]]  
    
198. Sovereigns may request to [[Pull]] relevant information in from other [[Map Nodes]]  
    
199. The Sovereigns within any given Domain should engage in [[Map Weaving]] in order to forge a higher order Map of Maps for that Domain as a specific subset of All  
    
200. The Highest Level Map of Maps covering any [[Domain]] should be freely available to All [[Members]] of that Domain

203. Every Sovereign should begin their Journey with the Highest Level Map they can access, and then Pull in the appropriate Local Maps as they Progress  
    
204. Upon entering any Domain, Visitors or Members should request or be offered access to the Local Map  
    
205. All Maps should meet the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]] to enable easy travel between Domains

### A Short Provisional Map of Reality 

**Who We Are**: Divine Co-Creators. EveryOne. Aspects of ONE Divine Body and Mind. Experiencing the Self-Imposed Illusions of Separation and Individuated Self.  
**Where We Are**: EveryWhen and EveryWhere. Experiencing Here and Now Individually and Locally.  
**Where We Are Going**: Towards Heaven EveryWhen and EveryWhere. And Here and Now.  
**How We Get There**: By Becoming It (Being) and Co-Creating It (Doing) across every InterExistent Holofractal Domain of [[Experiential Reality]]   
**How We Navigate**: We [[Continuously Improve]] Our [[Map of Reality]] and walk in the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]] by taking the [[Wise Right Next Steps]] each moment of the Eternal Now EveryWhen and EveryWhere 
**What are the Milestones?** The shift of consciousness and embodiment of a New Way of Being among a growing percentage of the Conscious Agents in Each Domain  
**What is the First Milestone in Any Domain?** For The First Few to Form a Circle and Begin [[The Common Journey]] Together
**What is the Second Milestone in Any Domain?** For The First Few to engage [[The First Three Percent]]. From there, the [[Tipping Point Strategy]] unfolds.   
**What are the [[Wise Right Next Steps]]?**  That depends on Who You Are and Where You Are on the [[Map of Reality]], and the Roles you are Playing in [[The Great Game]].    

## Part III - Next Steps For 2025 Season 4 Quest  

From Our Perspective, [[J's Death]], coupled with humanity's unwillingness and / or inability to [[Localize, Adapt, and Instantiate]] the [[Meta Project]] to Earth on Time—which would have saved hundreds of millions of lives—means that the [[Path]] now runs through [[Massive Decentralization]]—and perhaps massive suffering.

As [[The Great UnVeiling]] progresses and the lead cars of [[The Train of Civilization]] tumble into [[The Chasm]], humanity will slowly awaken to the Reality of its enslavement and [[The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History]].  

It will then face [[The Decision Point]] and [[The Sprint Through The Minefield]], possibly as soon as ~2026-2027. This is part of [[The Final Test]]. 

Ahead of schedule with nothing at hand to Push, We intend to spend the 2025 Season 4 Quest preparing Our Selves and those who want to begin Self-Organizing for The Sprint into 2026 and 2027. We are trusting that [[The Seed of LIONSBERG]] will germinate in each Domain at the Wise Right Time. 

This season will likely include the creation of the basic Templates, and possibly the introduction of a simple field guide to **The Great Game**. 

## A Way to Get Connected, Ask Questions, and Receive Guidance

We may also set up a simple mechanism to enable people those interested in forming their own Circles to get connected, become visible to one another, ask questions, and receive guidance 

## The Inability to Reason with Brainwashed Fear 

We are realizing that We cannot Reason with either Brainwashing or Fear  

Even in the best of times with the most enlightened and open minded collaborators, the co-creation of a New Civilization is an incredible Spiritual, Intellectual, and Emotional lift.  

The multi-generational enslavement and incarceration of the planet is obvious. To everyone except for those still imprisoned and enslaved in [[The Caves]]. 

Therefore as individuals Awaken... 
And We hear the rustling of The Chains... 
And discover those Seeking of a Path towards Liberation...  
We will simply invite those who are ready to Self-Organize into The Game.  

[[The Story of LIONSBERG]] tells how it happens.  
[[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]] is how it is done. 
[[The 144 Gates of Initiation]] constitute The Great ReFounding Journey. 

[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]] is emerging.
