# What If... What Then... What Next? 
A Post In [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]  
*September 13, 2025*

On August 9th, as local spiritual battle crescendoed,  
[[J]] wrote a short post titled **Unity Or Death**:

>***The Foundations of Civilization** have crumbled*  
>***The Existing Order** collapses by design*  
>***The War** for **Our Future** rages* 
>
>***Over a hundred million** have already been killed*  
>***Billions more** genetically modified, poisoned, or wounded*   
>*Plans call for the **Permanent Enslavement** of a small 'herd'*  
>***Of under 500 million post-human slaves***  
>*By ~2030*
>
>*This means the **Death** or **Enslavement** of **Every Human** on Earth*  
>*And the **Total Erasure** of the **Human Species** as we know it*   
>
>*As Our lives and civilization hang in the balance*  
>***EITHER WE UNITE OR DIE***  

On [[August 10th]], he was [[J's Death|killed]] in [[The War]].  

*Quite dramatic.*  
After so many millions of words,  
a final cry in **88**.  
Perhaps he had gone mad.  

***But What If...***

**What if** he ***knew** something **True***?  
**What if** he was ***experiencing** something **Real***?  
**What if** he had ***seen*** *something **Crucial***?  
**What if** his disturbing ***calculations** were **Correct***?  

It all sounds Fantastical. Conspiratorial. Unbelievable. Absurd.  

***But What If It Was True?...***  
***What If?*** 
***What Then?***  
***What Next?***
