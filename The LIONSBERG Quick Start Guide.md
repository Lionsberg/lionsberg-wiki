# The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide
*Your First 90 Minutes Together*

## You Are Here

You've read [[the nameless book]]. You've gathered your circle of 3 to 12 resonant souls. You're sitting together right now—in person or connected by video.

This guide will walk you through **this 90-minute gathering**—what to read aloud together, how to sense-make as a group, and how to choose your first quest.

By the end of today, you will have:
- Consecrated your circle with a name and simple agreements
- Read and reflected on **The Story** and **The Great Game** together
- Chosen your first **Seasonal Quest**
- Set your ongoing rhythm for gatherings and communications  

**Let's begin.**

## Your First 90 Minutes

### Minutes 0-10: Welcome & Opening

**One person facilitates** (rotate this role in future meetings).

**Welcome** (~2 min):
- Acknowledge everyone has read the opening of [[the nameless book]]
- We're here to step into The Story and The Great Game together
- This is a threshold moment—we're crossing from the Old World into the New

**Opening Round** (~8 min, ~1 min per person):

Go around the circle. Each person briefly shares:  
> "My name is _____, and I'm here because _____."  

Keep it short. This is connection, not explanation.

---

### Minutes 10-40: Reading Together

**One person reads aloud** while others listen with full attention. Don't rush. Let the words land.

Reading order:

1. **[[Prologue to The Story and The Great Game]]** (~10 min)
2. **[[The Story of LIONSBERG]]** (~10 min)
3. **[[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]** (~10 min)

_Don't worry about understanding everything. Let the story and the game wash over you. Sensing comes before understanding. Some will resonate immediately, some will need time to unfold._

---

### Minutes 40-70: Sensing & Forming the Circle

**Round 1: Individual Reflections** (~15 min, ~2-3 min per person)

Go around the circle. Each person shares:
- What resonated most from what we just read?
- What questions arose?
- What gifts do I bring to this circle?

**No cross-talk during this round**—just listen and witness each person's sharing.

**Round 2: Forming the Circle** (~15 min)

Now discuss together and decide:

**1. Circle Name** (~5 min)

Choose a name for your circle—or use a placeholder until one emerges.

Examples:
- Circle of [Your Location] (e.g., "Circle of Sandpoint")
- Circle of [Your Focus] (e.g., "Circle of Healing Arts")
- Circle of [Your Intention] (e.g., "Circle of the Sacred Flame")  
- "Vision Weavers"  
- "Map Weavers"  
- "The Fellowship of the Ring"  
- etc.  

Or simply: "Our Circle" until something better emerges.

**2. Simple Agreements** (~10 min)

Agree on 2-5 core commitments that will hold your circle together.

**Suggested starting agreements:**
- **Confidentiality**: What's shared in circle stays in circle  
- **Respect**: Honor each person's voice and journey  
- **Show up**: When you commit to attend, attend  
- **Universal Principles and Values**: Uphold universal values such as Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom
- **Communication**: Agree to check in and contribute regularly to keep the energy and flame of the group alive. Consider setting up a basic platform for asynchronous communications (text, Signal, Discord, Matrix, messenger pigeons, smoke signals, etc.)

Add any others that matter to your specific circle, but **keep it simple**—2-5 maximum. You can always add more later as needs arise.

### Minutes 70-90: Choosing Your Quest & Setting Rhythm

**What is a Quest?**

A Quest is a **tangible act of goodwill** you'll accomplish **together** before the next solstice or equinox (~90 days from now max depending on when you begin).

It should be:
- **Real**: Something that actually transforms your lives or community  
- **Achievable**: Within reach with several hours per week from your circle. 
- **Meaningful**: Connected to needs you see and gifts you can offer  
- **Together**: Requires collaboration, not individual action  

**Quest Brainstorm** (~10 min)

Go around the circle. Each person suggests one possibility:
- What need do we see in our community or lives?
- What gift could we offer together?
- What's practically achievable between now and the next solstice or equinox?

**Example First Quests:**
- Plant a community garden in a neglected space  
- Plan and host a neighborhood gathering to build connection and discuss this initiative  
- Create a mutual aid network for elders or families in need  
- Document local wisdom from indigenous elders or long-time residents  
- Build or repair something needed locally (playground, bench, library box)  
- Teach a skill to youth (music, martial arts, gardening, coding)  
- Clear and maintain a local trail or natural space  
- Map and begin a directory of local offers and needs  

**Choose ONE Quest** (~7 min)

Discuss which quest resonates most with the group. Look for:
- What lights people up when they talk about it?
- What aligns with gifts people named earlier?
- What's realistic given time and resources available?

**Choose your first quest.** Keep it simple—you're learning to play.

**Set Your Rhythm** (~3 min)

Decide together:
- **How often will we meet?** (Suggest at least weekly for 90 minutes to begin)
- **What day and time?** (Choose a consistent slot that works for everyone)
- **Where?** (Physical location or video link)
- **Who will send reminders?** (Rotate this role or assign to one person)

**Close with Gratitude** (~2-3 min)

Go around one final time. Each person completes this sentence:
> "I'm grateful for _____."  

---

## What Happens Next

### Your Weekly Rhythm

Use **[[The LIONSBERG Playbook]]** for detailed guidance on circle practices. Your typical meeting structure will be something like:

**Opening Ritual** (5 min)
- Brief centering practice (breath, meditation, or prayer)
- Remember who we are and why we're here

**Check-In Round** (10-15 min)
- Each person shares where they are and how they are coming in to the gathering (emotionally, spiritually, practically)
- No fixing, no discussion, just witnessing

**Quest Coordination** (30-40 min)
- Progress updates: What's been done since last meeting?
- Obstacles: What's blocking us?
- Planning: What are the [[Wise Right Next Steps]]?
- Support: Who needs what from the circle?  

**Retrospection and Learning Harvest** (10 min)
- What are we discovering as we work together?
- What's working that we would like to continue?   
- What would we like to do better in the future?
- What are we learning about ourselves, each other, the quest?  

**Closing Ritual** (5 min)
- Gratitude round
- Commitments: What will each person do before next meeting?
- Benediction or closing word

### Your Seasonal Rhythm

Every solstice and equinox (~every 90 days):

**1. Complete Your Quest**
- Celebrate what you've accomplished together
- Acknowledge the transformation in your lives and community
- Share stories of what emerged through your work

**2. Retrospective**
- What worked well in our circle?
- What would we like to do better in the future?
- What did we learn that we can carry forward?  
- What would we like to offer or share with other groups? 

**3. Choose Your Next Quest**
- What's calling us now?  
- What's the next tangible act of goodwill we can offer?  
- How do we want to grow or evolve as a circle?  

**4. Join Seasonal Gatherings** (as they emerge)
- Connect with other circles in your region
- Share stories and learnings
- Celebrate together as the movement grows  
- Begin aligning **Circles** into **Communities**, **Guilds**, and **Bioregions** from the bottom up  

### Passing The Flame

When transformation happens in your circle—when you experience breakthroughs, healing, or co-creation together—share [[Stories of Transformation]] and **pass the flame**:

**Invite 1-3 Others**
- People who are awakening to the crisis
- Ready for action
- Resonate with what you're experiencing

**Point Them to the Beginning**
- Send them to: **lionsberg.wiki**
- Ask them to read the homepage and opening of [[the nameless book]]
- Support them as they gather their own circle, or integrate into yours  

**Each Person You Invite Becomes a Carrier of the Light**

This is how [[The First Three Percent]] emerges—through organic invitation cascading through trust networks, not mass marketing or central control.

## Two Pathways Forward

### Path 1: Self-Organized Circle

Continue independently using the resources in this guide and [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]].

**You have everything you need.** You're sovereign, self-governing, and free to adapt the patterns to your context.

### Path 2: Join The Nameless Instance

If you want deeper community, guidance, and planetary coordination, consider joining **[[the nameless instance]]**—the first faithful attempt to incarnate the LIONSBERG pattern at scale, personally guided by [[The Nameless One]].

**Commitment:** The first tenth of your time (~several hours per week)
**Structure:** Universal (planetary coordination) and/or Local (community-based)
**Contact:** [See [[the nameless book]] section on "the nameless instance" for details]

**Both paths are valid. Both are needed.** Choose what resonates with your circle.
