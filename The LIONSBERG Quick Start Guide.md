# The LIONSBERG Quickstart Guide

## Context 

On its **Quest** towards **Destiny** humanity stands at a threshold. 

At the end of a long era — 
And before **What Comes Next** —
Earth and its people face a convergence  
Unlike any in the last 10,000 years  

A **Final Test** is now underway  
Its outcome will shape centuries if not millennia to come

While many details will remain contested, distorted, or forever unknown  
The essence of this **[[Meta Crisis]]** is now unmistakable:  

>_Whether humanity awakens and unites in time  
>To **design and build a New Civilization**  
>And **co-create Heaven On Earth**  
>Before the old systems collapse by design_  

## LIONSBERG 

Like an ancient bridge spanning an impossible chasm  
**LIONSBERG** is purpose-built _for this_  

It offers an immediate Way  
To transcend systemic collapse  
And begin co-creating Heaven On Earth  
Here, now, together  

Portals such as [[Above The Chaos]] and [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]  
Open into thousands of pages and millions of words  
Articulating the deeper architecture and inception of this work  

But experience across many realms has revealed a simple truth: 

>_To Know the Way one must live it_

For most resonant souls,  
Attempting to intellectually grasp  
Cosmically interoperable, holofractal pattern languages  
Is  both unnecessary and counterproductive at first  

This is not a theory to debate  
It is a **Game to be played**  
And a **Way to be embodied**   

## The Invitation

If this resonates, begin simply: 

1. **Read The Story**  
2. **Play The Game**  
3. **Pass The Flame**  

This is a co-operative, real-world game  
Of awakening, relationship, and transformational co-creation  

> _When 8 billion people play the New Game_
> _Heaven has arrived on Earth_

## Immediate Next Steps  

Gather. Begin. Play. 

1. **Invite** 2 to 5 resonant individuals into a physical or digital circle    
2. **Read aloud** the *Prologue*, _Story_, and this  _Quickstart Guide_  
3. **Form the Circle** by choosing a name and establishing simple agreements  
4. **Set a Cadence** by defining weekly, monthly, and seasonal rhythms  
5. **Choose a First Seasonal Quest** — a tangible act of goodwill in your domain or locality, achievable before the next solstice or equinox   
6. **Pass The Flame** by sharing stories of transformation and inviting others to play
