# Requests For Guidance
In the [[LIONSBERG System]], Requests For Guidance, or RFG's, are used as formal system of two-way information exchange and clarification between elements of the System. 

Requests For Guidance are tracked in the [[Request For Guidance Tracker]]. 

One primary function function of Requests For Guidance is to clarify [[Designer's Intent]] among co-creators. If you are unsure, please ask for Guidance. 

A second primary function is to ensure that the distributed array of autonomous groups is aware of everything that Lionsberg is aware of, and that Lionsberg is aware of everything the distributed array of autonomous groups are aware of.

These requests for guidance are great snapshots in time that can help you get caught up with all that is emerging.
