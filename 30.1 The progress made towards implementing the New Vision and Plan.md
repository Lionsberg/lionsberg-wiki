# 30.1 The progress made towards implementing the New Vision and Plan

As more and more people around the world have awaken to the New Vision and Plan, significant efforts are being made around the world to begin implementing it. While there is still much work to be done, the progress made so far has been encouraging and has laid the foundation for continued success.

Around the world, various working groups and task forces have formed to focus on specific areas of regenerative development. These groups have been working diligently to identify and prioritize the most pressing challenges and opportunities in their respective areas, and to develop action plans for addressing them.

In the area of sustainable agriculture, for example, significant progress has been made in promoting regenerative farming practices and supporting farmers in transitioning to these methods. This has included the development of training and education programs, as well as the creation of financial incentives for farmers who adopt regenerative practices. Co-ops, and co-ops of co-ops, are emerging into ever greater forms of coordination and organization to help one another overcome structural challenges that are different for individual food producers to overcome in isolation. 

In the area of renewable energy, progress has also been made in increasing the deployment of clean and renewable energy sources, and in supporting the development of new technologies and infrastructure. This has included the implementation of policies and regulations to support the growth of renewable energy, as well as the creation of financial incentives for businesses and individuals to invest in clean energy.

In the area of sustainable transportation, progress has been made in promoting the use of clean and efficient modes of transportation, and in supporting the development of infrastructure for electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. This has included the implementation of policies and regulations to support the growth of sustainable transportation, as well as the creation of financial incentives for businesses and individuals to invest in electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

In the area of community development, progress has been made in promoting the participation and empowerment of marginalized and under-served communities in the development process. While still uneven, this has included the creation of community-led development programs, as well as the support for community-based organizations working to address the specific needs of their communities.

In addition to these specific areas of focus, progress has also been made in building the broader movement and support necessary for the successful implementation of the New Vision and Plan. This has included the development of networking and outreach programs to raise awareness and build understanding about the Meta Crisis and the need for a New Vision and Plan to address it, as well as the creation of opportunities for individuals and communities to come together and work towards common goals.

Further, advanced new technologies for coordination, communication, and empowering and measuring impact have been developed in preparation for the 7 year window. Already, hundreds of impact organizations in dozens of countries have connected to the shared platforms being developed, and are beginning to increase their awareness, communication, and coordination with one another. 

Lastly, whereas as many of those in the rising movement felt isolated and alone prior to 2022, the accelerating networking and interconnections among agents of change over the last years has allowed us to find one another and gain the sense of relief and encouragement that comes with knowing that we are no longer alone. 

Overall, while there is still much work to be done, the progress made so far towards implementing the New Vision and Plan has been significant and has laid the foundation for continued success. By continuing to build momentum and support for the Vision, we can ensure that we are able to achieve the transformative change necessary to create a regenerative and resilient future for All.
