# Co-Creating The New World

The [[Meta Charge]] of the Receiver to accomplish the [[Meta Goal]], for the benefit of [[All]], contained, implied, and ordered within itself the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] required to Co-Create the [[New World]]. 

The [[Meta Goal]] could not be [[Realize|Realized]] unless and until the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] was [[Realize|Realized]]. 

Therefore, the simple [[Meta Charge]] and definition of success for the Receiver, which was one with the [[Community]] and [[Federation]], was to succeed and avoid failure in progressively realizing the [[Meta Goal]], so that [[All]] generations of [[Life]] could flourish in [[Harmony]].
