# What Is Integrated Delivery
Integrated Delivery is a philosophic approach for designing a production or delivery system that maximizes [[Value]] creation, while progressively eliminating [[Waste]]. 

[[Value]] can be defined as [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]] of the [[System]]. 

Simply put, Integrated Delivery uses lean design-build principles in a process-centered approach to developing and delivering a program of action.  Lean principles were originally implemented in manufacturing and first “discovered” by experts reviewing and documenting the Toyota Production System.  Toyota had shown great success with a new and different type of production line that required each step in the process to produce _only what was needed by the next step in the process_ and to view anything else as waste.  The behaviors and tools used by Toyota were documented and used to define a _lean_ _system_.

Subsequently, it has been discovered that these principles closely map to the way that Living Systems operate. Over time, the goal of the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] is to continually merge the creative capacity of humanity towards harmony with the way Creation itself creates.  

**_The essence of Lean Integrated Project Delivery is to view any program of action as a UNIFIED SYSTEM properly designed to produce throughput of THE GOAL into reality. The Goal is to bring the Design Intent, as articulated in the plans and specifications, and as understood through discernment and collaboration, into Reality._** 

In the 1990s, various people in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry began developing independent strategies for applying lean principles in the delivery of construction projects. 

When applied to construction, lean changes a project from a combination of activities to a system of dependent and variable tasks that must be managed based upon the unique human interactions that support work being done. In short, it transforms the [[Program of Action]] into a [[Goal Delivery System]]. 

The idea of a **_design build program as a system_** requires all participants to focus on the [[Flow of Work]] on the **_entire project_** and not just for activity optimization within their own silo. **_It requires that all participants work together collaboratively to optimize at the highest level, rather than sub-optimizing at the local level_**.  _Lean Project Delivery_, a term used to describe the application of lean to design-build projects, establishes a project where the owner, the design team, the builder and operational personnel work together to design a project that delivers the owner’s identified goals.  Thinking of a design-build project as a single collective enterprise requires readjusting traditional notions of project delivery and economy.  Like lean manufacturing systems, lean construction and Integrated Project Delivery embraces very specific behaviors and tools, which have a substantially beneficial effect on the entire project.

For the human species at this moment in history, if we do not rapidly embrace a higher order methodology to optimize at the highest integrated level for the wellbeing of [[All]], we will fail.

Let’s not fail.
