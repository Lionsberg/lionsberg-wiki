# Systems Thinking

Definition of Systems Thinking: Systems Thinking is a holistic approach to problem-solving that recognizes the interconnections and interdependence between various elements in a system. It focuses on the relationships and patterns between components, rather than just analyzing individual parts. Systems Thinking considers the impact of changes in one area of a system on the entire system and seeks to understand the system as a whole. By considering the big picture, Systems Thinking enables individuals and organizations to identify root causes of problems, develop more effective solutions, and create more sustainable outcomes.

### Importance of Systems Thinking 

The universe is, by nature, ONE interexistent system of systems. If we want to think accurately about the world, we MUST think in terms of systems. Systems Thinking is becoming increasingly relevant in today's complex and interconnected world. It allows individuals, organizations, and communities to effectively navigate challenges and opportunities by taking into account the relationships, interconnections, and synergies between different components. This approach to problem-solving enables individuals and organizations to identify underlying patterns and root causes, and develop more effective and regenerative solutions. Additionally, Systems Thinking fosters a more collaborative and adaptive mindset, encouraging individuals to consider the perspectives of others and the Whole, and to continuously evolve their understanding of complex adaptive systems and their relationship to the universe and its Source.
