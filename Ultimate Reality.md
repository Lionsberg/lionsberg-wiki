# Ultimate Reality

"Ultimate Reality" refers to the highest and most fundamental Reality that transcends and gives rise to the manifest universe or Reality we exist in and perceive. It is often associated with philosophical concepts like God, the Divine, the Infinite, the Eternal, the Absolute and the Transcendent. Ultimate Reality is considered to be the Source of all [[Wisdom]], [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Goodness]], and [[Beauty]], and serves as the standard of excellence that inspires and guides the Lionsberg System towards its universal and eternal Vision, Aim, and Goal. 

The understanding of Ultimate Reality is aligned with the wisdom of all traditions that seek to know, understand, and rightly relate to [[God]], [[Absolute]], [[One]], [[Creator]], etc. 

The Lionsberg System draws upon this eternal and universal Wisdom to create a world that is more harmonious, loving, truthful, just, wise, and good, where everyone can live a life of purpose, meaning, and fulfillment.
