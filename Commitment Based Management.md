# Commitment Based Management

[[Requests]] and [[Commitments]] between team members are the basis of [[Communication]] within Lean Integrated Delivery.Â  

**_Simply stated, one party makes a request and another commits to fulfilling that request according to mutually agreed upon [[Conditions of Satisfaction]]_**.  

[[Conditions of Satisfaction]] are critical to ensuring that both parties understand what satisfaction of the request actually means. 

This discipline helps avoid miscommunications that erode [[Trust]]. 

[[Commitments]] are tracked from request to completion in order to promote [[Transparency]] and to allow the team to collectively learn from breakdowns in the [[Network of Commitments]].
