# The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity

In the Lionsberg System, the **7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity** refers to the period between 2024 and 2030, during which the Meta Crisis and Meta Opportunity will reveal their various dimensions, and the opportunity for forge the [[New Era]] will be present. 

If we fail to capture the opportunity in this window of time, it is not obvious that it will remain open in future decades or generations. 

The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity is followed by [[The 3 Year Lag]], together composing the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], which is followed by the [[20 Year Generational Contingency]]. 

The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity is preceded by [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], which began in 2017 in anticipation.
