# Internal Context

The [[Internal Context]] of any Individual, Organization, or Community is its current [[State of Being]] within its individual and local [[Boundary Of Being]]. 

The [[Internal Context]] of an individual or local element relates its conception of [[Who We Are]], as distinguished from and within our [[External Context]]. 

Understanding of our [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]] is key to the [[Self Governance]] of any Vessel we are [[Navigating]].

## Basic Context From The Perspective Of Lionsberg Looking In

We are emerging into existence along with a massive array of other incarnations around the world in response to [[That Which Is Longing To Emerge]]. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] of our [[Purpose]] and Reason for [[Being]] is to be a servant of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

To [[Meet The Needs]] and [[Solve The Problems]] at hand, our [[Mission]] is to connect, equip, and empower the entire distributed network of individuals, organizations, and initiatives working together towards the [[One Thing]] that unites us [[All]].  

To [[Progress]] towards this [[Aim]], we are [[Doing Our Best]] to [[Co-Create]] the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] that enable the [[Group Of Groups]] to rise towards [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. 

To date, we have created an integrated an comprehensive [[Story]], [[System]], [[Platform]], [[Structure]], [[Strategy]], and [[Plan]]. 

We are now inviting a [[Group Of Groups]] into Communication and Community so that we can [[Deep Listening|Listen Deeply]] to [[One Another]] and [[Help One Another]]. 

We are doing this in the form of a [[Game]]. 

Our approximate near term [[Aim]] is to connect 1 billion groups to the Lionsberg [[Platform]] and [[Community]] within 7 years, by Q4 2029. 

This [[Milestones|Milestone]] will place us in a position to accomplish the 2040 and 2050 Goals, and pass the baton. 

Based on our current internal state, we need to incorporate energy and resources from the [[External Context]] to fuel our [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]].
