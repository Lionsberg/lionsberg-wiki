# Internal Context

The [[Internal Context]] of any Individual, Organization, or Community is its current [[State of Being]] within its individual and local [[Boundary Of Being]]. 

The [[Internal Context]] of an individual or local element relates its conception of [[Who We Are]], as distinguished from and within our [[External Context]]. 

Understanding of our [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]] is key to the [[Self Governance]] of any Vessel we are [[Navigating]].
