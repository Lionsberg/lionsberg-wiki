# Social Experiment

In April 2022, we began a social experiment to explore the abstract notion of the [[Meta Project]] in 6 week cycles, alongside the [[Lionsberg]] System and Infrastructure we had Co-Created. 

By mid 2022, the story and the structure were in place, dozens of people from around the world were engaged, and we were beginning to learn how to act our the idea of a [[Meta Community]] engaged in a [[Meta Project]] to accomplish a [[Meta Goal]], for the benefit of [[All]]. 

Simultaneously, we were validating that the [[Meta Idea]] would have to be instantiated and acted out in a [[Time]] and [[Space]] and [[Domain]], and could not be [[Enact|Enacted]] in the abstract. 

In October 2022, after 4 cycles, we closed the season of exploring the [[Meta Project]] in the abstract, and prepared to begin [[Enact|Enacting]] [[The Plan]] through [[Lionsberg]]. 

It would soon be time to help connect up and empower heroes on the front lines around the world to the [[Lionsberg]] System to accelerate their individual and local progress towards our overarching and uniting shared [[Goal]]. 

For the sake of history, that is when we published this Guide.
