# Lionsberg Cycles of Growth

The **Lionsberg Cycles of Growth** chart the Fibonacci sequence and model the progression of [[The Movement]] as Co-Creators join and advance along the [[Critical Path]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. Each cycle represents an unfolding of unity, purpose, and co-creation, starting from the Source and spiraling outward into a flourishing, interconnected world.

This model not only symbolizes natural growth and harmony but also serves as a strategic guide for tracking the expansion of [[The Movement]] in real time.

## **How It Works**

- **Source:** The [[ONE]] origin of [[All]]—the Divine emanation of Spirit and Incarnation.
- **Cycles:** Each cycle represents an increasing number of Co-Creators joining and contributing to the [[New Civilization]] as [[The Vision]] unfolds.

## **Comparisons and Context**

For a sense of scale:

1. [Cartogram of World Population](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram)  
2. [List of Countries by Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population)  

By the completion of the 40th cycle, as [[The First Three Percent]] are engaged, Lionsberg will represent the 5th largest sovereignty on Earth—exceeding the population of all but the world’s most populous nations and establishing a transformative [[New]] global presence.
