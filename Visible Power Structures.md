# Visible Power Structures

[[Visible Power Structures]] refer to the institutions, organizations, and leaders that operate in the public domain and appear to wield authority over political, economic, social, religious, and cultural systems. These structures are the most recognizable aspects of governance and influence, yet they often serve as intermediaries or proxies for deeper, hidden forces.

    [[Visible Power Structures]] rely on the established systems of finance, technology, and information control to maintain their position and legitimacy.
