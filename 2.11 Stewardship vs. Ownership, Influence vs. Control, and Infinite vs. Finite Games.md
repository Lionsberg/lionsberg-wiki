# 2.11 Stewardship vs. Ownership, Influence vs. Control, and Infinite vs. Finite Games

The Lionsberg System is designed as a co-operative ecosystem that values Stewardship over Ownership, Influence over Control, and Infinite Games over Finite Games. 

While Circles are free to default to the simple "employee ownership" paradigm of the Old World for commercial activities, as soon as a Circle begin dividing a Domain up into percentages of ownership under the illusion of control while acting as "employees", they create a closed and finite game that ensures many different kinds of issues and limitations down the road. 

By choosing from the outset to co-operate on the basis of shared stewardship over ownership and influence over control for each of the Domains we establish, we open up the possibility for Infinite Games that can be played indefinitely into **The Future We Seek**.
