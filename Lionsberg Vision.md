# Lionsberg Vision  

## The Lionsberg Vision:

To co-create a world in which all people have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, and in which the natural environment is regenerated and and restored for future generations. 

This can occur through a system in which [[All Generations of Life]] [[Help One Another]] develop towards the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish. 

We are co-creating the [[Lionsberg System]] to connect and empower a diverse [[Group Of Groups]] to embody this Goal. 

For a fuller and more vivid description of what this might look like, see [[Best Possible Future]].
