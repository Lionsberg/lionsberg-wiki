WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay. beautiful. September seventh, 22 beautiful Wednesday navigation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Call Thanks for being here, so I wanted to spend today like seeing if we could actually roll up our sleeves and do some navigation together.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We're kind of at a really fun critical exciting gesture where, things are changing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So some kind of a exciting point in time so that's maybe consider this kind of a mid 6 week cycle retro.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There's there's some things that i'd like to just see if we could all kind of sync up on Compare the the patterns that we're seeing and then make some some key adjustments that hopefully it'll be really

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
helpful, and hopefully, we can do that kind of in the context of all that would then accomplishing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So i'm finding for myself. that there's this dynamic that's happening where even though sometimes it feels like It's slow or bumpy, or any then it's like as we get through these little

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
milestones, obviously like the next vista opens up, and I could see things that I couldn't see.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You know, even a week or 2 before and from multiple spots in the network.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I think that's that's kind of happening for people So I wanted to just take take today to really sense into those those patterns make some key adjustments.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I think you guys know that Kelu and I and Graham are going to Estonia next week.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The next week will be a little any Then and then one of the things that i'd love to emerge with clarity on today is is some of the key working groups we're gonna try to try to pull into areas of

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:11.000
pipe function over the next several weeks so with that So let's let's start with talking about maybe patterns that were that we're noticing or seeing and in this context of kind of a mid

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
cycle adjustment. Both Wendy and Judy and Pete

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Both. Both had observations this week on how things are working and how we might adjust and what we need to be clear on. and those kind of things.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So would it be okay if we just kind of dive into some listening about people's?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Patterns. they're seeing and then towards it will spend like let's say, somewhere between that half and 2 thirds of the meeting.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Kind of getting clear on the patterns and Then We'll We'll close out with the key adjustments that we're going to make and establishing clarity around functional working groups that we we need to get

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yep forming in order to take next steps. So do I.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Have a rough consent to that. that agenda.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Does that sound? okay to everybody? Okay, cool So let's go into to deep listening mode.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Pete, I know you might not be comfortable with us, but may I have her permission to ask you to share

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Some of the live, correct observations you shared with me that Yeah.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Sure try to be more direct than I want to be I don't know how well i'll be with that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But let me let me start a little bit more softly than that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I think, a pattern that the pattern i'm kind of waiting to see emerge is for people who are really passionate to be doing the things they're really passionate about and getting resources for that work from the network the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
larger network, whatever that is. I don't care too much I mean I care a lot.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But but the pattern is really How do we get more resources to help people who are doing the stuff they really want to do, And they're doing anyone already.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
How do we get them? more resources? so they can do more of it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I, during the night talk spoke 45Â min ago something like that, briefly.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And I think what Jordan is asking is a thing that I see with Jordan and Lionsberg.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Jordan is an amazing and wonderful person, and I think his superpowers. The thing that he can do that that other people can't do as well are convening, and shepherding so helping everybody like cluster around

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and then help everybody get moving in a forward direction together. and The thing that I think join is especially good at He's done it a bunch of times for me is like you. Get straight off a little bit.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
You get a little bit distracted it's like i'm tired.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I don't want to do this anymore we're not doing the right thing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Jordan is really good at picking gently back up and pointing back towards the the right direction.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The North Star for everybody. right so I feel like that's Jordan superpower.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I also feel like Jordan has got a life work that he's done building stuff.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Jordan knows a lot about how to move. big projects, really big projects into action and commitment and and production.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And you know recovery from little misadjustments and things like that.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And Jordan, I think, would love to do that.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And if he had enough time and energy he would just like, do everything the Meta project needs to get done, and I think that's the wrong thing to do.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I strengthen commitment for building stuff isn't going to be big enough to get the whole thing done.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So what I was telling Jordan is like dude.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I think you should focus on your superpowers shepherding and convening and pull back a little bit on being the person driving program management or the person driving the team driving the program. management.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So I feel like the thing for Linsburg to do is to gather resources, help everybody with structure, and then cultivate the things that it wants to see.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But I think also it should be not in the business of actually doing any of that.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It needs to help other people actually be the arms and legs and feet and hands, heads doing stuff together.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So that was my. that was my pitch to Jordan in a few minutes a few minutes ago.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yeah, thanks, cute. One thing that I love and appreciate about he is that although he doesn't like to be, I appreciate how truthful and right

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So let's dialogue a little bit more sense into.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But since or discern, into what pete is presenting as a hypothesis, i'm i'm gonna like tack on a coda, maybe so there's some obvious things one of them is that I

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
don't take the un sdgs if we wanted kind of a top-level set of goals.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
There are people in the world where, working on every little piece of those.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I think most of us here aren't going to cover all of the Sdgs very well.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Each of us has their own passion and their own projects that they work on.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I work on Massive wiki and other things wendy's working on tapestry Vincent works on catalyst Michael's working on factor those are things we're going to be doing Anyway, it's hard

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to roll them up and cover all of the Sgs that way.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So we have. so we have a kind of a weird chicken and egg situation.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We don't have the right people to do all the things that we want to do and maybe the things that people are passionate about doing aren't the things that we particularly wanted to do.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So we can either look for the right people, or and I think this one is better.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
We can kick. people that we know are strong at doing stuff and use them as tent poles.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Basically to start percolating evolving emerging a structure of people working together, even if it's not exactly what we wanted to do.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But again it's the think I think the thing that we need to do is make sure that people are doing the things that they're passionate about and passionate about about the things that they are doing, and that's like the the

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:07.000
key to making this all work at scale. there was a article in the Wall Street Journal this morning on the the the disengaged workforce that I think the most recent gallop ball shows that that was that's like at the highest

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
ever, and I think there is something I forget what it was.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
20 or 30% of respondents said they were like passionately and actively engaged in their job.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
You know, 30% said they were actively disengaged. and you know, the the other 60% said they were doing the the bare minimum.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Basically the to get by or not get fired. So that was interesting, right?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And I think it illustrates what he's saying is you can't buy the passion and risk required to go do what we need to do with money like you can't put a bunch of people on the payroll and say

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
let's do this. So so what pete was saying any he said a little bit differently.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This morning is, you need to find the people who are already out there and gonna be doing it, no matter what, and just help them do it a little bit better and faster and more resource than market coordinated and more together versus trying to

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
so anyway, that that all makes a lot of sense

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah, I i've been thinking a lot about this too, and I think we were.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Some of these points came up last week, and they were percolating for me the the whole week. And what did I do?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Of course I built a flow. the flow Help me see the flow helps me.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:32.000
See that really it's almost like We have to do 2 things at once, and I agree with Pete that the passion is the is the thread of those of both things.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
One is. once we have a sense of that, we can either push things in one of 2 ways.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We can either say, Hey, Who's in the room What are they passionate about?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Where does that intersect allow that to emerge, and then fund it, and enable it, and support it, and resource it?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Or we can say what is it we're trying to get done Who do we need to get that thing done?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Find the people that already love doing that thing, source them, resource them, support them, get it done.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I think the truth is for a group that's trying to collaborate at such a high level, and across so many different places.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We need to be thinking about both at the same time. Right?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So there is an awareness that we're never gonna have we're not.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
There's never going to be a case where we always have the right people in the right right room at the right time, And so that came up in our social architecture meeting today.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It helped me rephrase. Really, the so-called I helped to frame for the social architecture group.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Maybe a real purpose in that group is to keep thinking about.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
How do we get the right people in the right place at the right time in the right way with the right tech? right?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So that we're thinking about the flow, whether somebody comes in because they were drawn to this group and they have something to offer up, and they're ready to give, or they were drawn as group, because someone invited them specifically to come in because they

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
had the right skills or talent for a particular project or because they just they came in the back door around some way.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They don't even know how They ended up? here? However, they end up here.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
How do we get them into the right spots and resource that individual?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
That project that organization. right? then it's about scale and scope doing it slightly differently in order to align everything.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:32.000
For the best good of everyone trying, you know, trying to advance the Sdgs in this case, or whatever else we might choose to focus on, that felt very freeing to me.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And in what seemed to be this kind of lock trap of wanting this to be a place where we can collaborate from a place of resonance and emergence and passion. and yet recognition that it's not enough to move any one

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:02.000
thing forward because our scope is so big. So I was trying to wrestle with that and realized we were missing the piece of inviting the right people in of picking some focus areas of focus and inviting the right people in to make sure that

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:17.000
we have. we have all the people that we need

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Worst.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Am I getting it unmuted now? i'm on yeah, okay. building on what you said wendy, which sounds really great.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That's The experience that we've had with planetary care is that there is at least from our case there's sufficient platforms available and sufficient interest that when one is really clear about wanting to pull in particular people that

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000
are values aligned to be able to do particular tasks that's actually quite achievable.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:34.000
What's much more difficult to achieve is actually having the inner core plus the digital infrastructure necessary to can hold to train to oversee, to manage essentially in a good way of that term to get the desired outcome that

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:52.000
a particular project might be about. So I think that that both Anne is really see and and and it almost fits in those 2 places like that inner core which it has to have that flexibility of being able to where lots of different hats move around

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and be able to adjust. while as that gets more robust.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And then really all comes back to resources, because with the resources, then

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
You have a much smaller pool to be able to access

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So so for us we've talked about this a minute. try to just just weave in and and summarize back what I think you're saying as a country to our previous conversation.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So I think what we're seeing out there in the network is like all, all the good, passionate people organizations, groups, etc. are out there, and there's enough technology and communication and goodwill in the network that when

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:53.000
There's clarity around what needs to be accomplished and how people can plug in there's plenty of desire, interest, passion to do that where where we're struggling is with the is that it that the actual building of the contacts the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
structure and I don't know organizational framework. It takes for a core to be able to coordinate that whole network.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Is, it has been a loosen, right? So so what I?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So then, where where we might go if we were thinking about systems.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Design is to go. Okay, we're gonna have a a large distributed network of passionate teams.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If we pick up on what pete's saying we want to find those teams that are already out there, doing whatever they're going to be doing, anyway, but could maybe go faster, and you know, So planetary care is a great example, like

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000
you and Marianne and your allies are doing that regardless of not having as much resources if you like, and you're sacrificing a lot.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And so you wanna find those find you know pizza or Bradz, or Wendy's.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Words. you know all those different things are already moving the display.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So then, if we could build and resource the kind of core team and infrastructure to to coordinate across those that might be kind of the missing the missing link, so there's the resources the core team and

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
infrastructure. and then the coordination of the distributed networks of passionate teams.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It's something like that or correct me. where yeah I would I would. Yeah, thank you.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:31.000
That was great. I I also think about it from a point of view of of a pie chart, and needing to think that you want to make sure that the the right player the right enough energy as being put into different sections of

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:51.000
this pie chart that include when you're bringing people in particularly when you're bringing people in, and so and that pie chart distribution is gonna change particularly over the first 90 days of where attention might be given show the attention to

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000
onboarding is like a really important intention that we have gotten feedback from other organizations that have been very successful.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
With this, another attention is really recognizing. We want to by supporting passion.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:24.000
We have to recognize that they're coming from very different broad sets of background, of knowledge of kind, of a systems view of life, of how this fits together of the various technologies, and wanting to give access a little bit support not

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
overwhelmed, but enough to feel coherent within the group.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So those would be the couple. other pieces

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, that makes sense, and that that Oh, very.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Go ahead, Marianne. Yeah, just share my question I didn't meet miss, a few meetings, so if our goal is to meet the 17 Sdgs.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:08.000
There are many focuses within each sdg right we're going to be food and water that can go across many of them.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
There are thousands of organizations and people who are working towards all those different parts of those Sdgs.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So I'm I'm hearing that you wanna really slowly bring them all in to the Meta project.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I guess, in phases, and me to figure out what order, and you know how.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
How fast can you do that? and how do we coordinate and structure all that?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Because they're all working on this yeah align values when there's some things we need to get done to do it right. So that's what i'm hearing.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Yeah. So so Marianne like what in the inception of this. What we found was was exactly what you just said, It's like, Okay, all the absolutely brilliant heroic efforts towards everything are already underway.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:16.000
There's nothing that doesn't you know there's nothing that God in the universe didn't 10 or 20 years call somebody, too, who spent a lifetime now developing that thing right and we simultaneously couldn't

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
find any organization that it recently and pushed to its it's end would actually be able to accomplish the total set of global goals.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Let's say or design and build the future that that we're all moving towards.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So therefore it was like okay, there's there's it's almost like parts.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Someone used, I think, Pete, earlier Use the analogy of the body like the hands and the feet.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Whatever. let's say, the hands in the feet and the ears and the eyes are strewn across the earth and they're all out there.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000
The basic problem is they're not functioning as a coordinated body that's actually capable of moving around the world, picking things up, getting things done and doing doing right?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So. So what we? So that was the whole inception of this Lyonsberg in the Meta project was that understanding?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And so to to continue. that that analogy there's a there's an old prophetic vision, and the Jewish Scriptures That's the profit standing looking over a valley in the valley's full of dry

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
bones right, just just dry bones out there, and the proper.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Here is a voice that says, you know, speak to the dry bones.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And so, as the profit starts speaking, the bones start rising up and coming in to structure.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Right, and all of a sudden, you have you have life right and So it's It's something like that that vision right?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
It's like, Okay, all the amazing parts and pieces are out there?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:47.000
How do we speak to that? right? How do we speak to that and bring that up into some kind of functional unity, so that all of a sudden, together we're accomplishing what we never could have accomplished in isolation but with each

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000
of those things, you know playing Its unique like their unique role so it's not all coming together to become one undifferentiated thing, but it's it's I think what you just said is correct?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's like, How do we sequence out all those things and connect them into the right places at the right time?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Give them the right support, connect them up to the neural networks.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
They need the energy they need whatever, so that they can function in their unique way as part of a whole.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So I think that gets to you know kind of this whole flow that the decide. Does that match kind of wait what you're what you think.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I think the brilliance of what you're saying is that we they all we all need the same goals right.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
You might be solving the sdgs but it could be running in different directions and pulling away from what you're trying to do. right.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So you should coordinate everybody with the same goals and values and metrics.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Then you can pull in the same direction. otherwise you're just flailing.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So Yeah, I yeah, I agree. and and marianne i'll say expert systems Designer: right?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The the extension of that is Is this differentiation of value and waste in a goal delivery system right?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So like soota production system. lean have taught us that all that uncoordinated activity is actually waste.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
That's inhibiting pretty good of the goal so that's kind of funny.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It's like all that activity towards the global goals might actually be what stopping us from accomplishing the global goals, And so exactly.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And it's getting in the way it's confusing things it's causing misdirected funding so.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So the coming together, and coordination, and the resources of the resources and connection of the right thing, things, right times, right reasons to get that flowing.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And then I want to connect it back to what pete's saying again, Is that all that effort like those those body parts around the world?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Those aren't things we're trying to fabricate those are like things dying to become the fullness of themselves already.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Right? so that's I think such a critical insight that eats bringing in is we don't have to reinvent them.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
We don't have to try to go create massive Wiki, because Pedd rebuild it. we don't have to go try to create back there.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Mike already built. It don't have to create tapestry Wendy already built it right.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Don't have to create planetary care you guys have already built it.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So all those things are already there. it's. just the the mechanisms for connecting and empowering.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Okay, Bill.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Yeah, thanks, jordan I like what you're saying there i've you know i've been with you for 4 years now 4 years, plus and i'm i'll reiterate a little bit of what you just said when we

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:49.000
started. We looked at the fragmentation in the nonprofit world, and a hyper competition and fragmentation and extremes in the for profit world and thought.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:01.000
We need to deal with that, and unify our approach through all friends, like salting the earth and spreading light.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It touches everything. So what I ponder here in this discussion is, do you extend to which our superpowers as individuals?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Need to be considered, which is highly people. will not function happily. if they don't feel that they're hearts in their work. and like, I said, when we were meeting this morning, Jordan, it Everyone's gonna say Hey, I I can

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:51.000
do this thing, but if they're not passionate about it it's just an item on a resume, and they they'll say that they like what they're gonna do, so finding people who truly have a passion or something is important But here's the thing

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I think we can ask ourselves not just what are our individual superpowers.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
But since there are so many people out there doing so many good things, and we don't even know about them.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:18.000
They don't know about each other the real question is what is the super power of this community that's what you and I were looking for, you know, and all these years of assembling a structure.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:38.000
It's what's, missing and the missing thing as you're, you know, pointing to is unity and coordination, and so to be aggregators and unifiers and message takers as well as getting

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
our fingers into the different soil of activity because if you don't do something, You it's harder to talk about it.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
But to be the the aggregators and to be the connectors and the servants of the process.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000
He's Really, I think the collective superpower and another thing is the messaging.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
There are a lot of people out there who don't they don't like the un.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.000
They don't embrace anything in the us so just because the Un. says that they don't like it, but they do believe in conservation and hard work and integrity and diligence.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:30.000
So I think our messaging needs to be clarified, and people need to be given a rationale to embrace a different way of looking at the earth, and they're fragmented, and and they wish it could be better and so we

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.000
have the ability to unify messages and to spread a better message, because when things are fragmented they are ineffective.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And there are those in this world who have an agenda to keep people fragments so their own rip on power can't be fractured.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So those good that asking profound questions in a session a little bit ago, he said.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
What's the one thing that everybody thinks is impossible. but if you could accomplish it?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Everything would change right. All the dominoes would fall everything can be a accomplished, And the unanimous answer in that working group was was this idea of some kind of higher order, functional unity?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
It's like all the pieces are out there it's impossible as human beings to work together apparently.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
But if we could, like everything else, would be covered so so that that right there is like the core.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
So, Pete? I'm thinking about what what you said about super powers, and what's ours to do?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And what not ours to do you know that's something like you can be shepherding, and if it's if it's happens to be true.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
We can also build useful tools and technology and gather resources that empower people like all the better. Right?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So so that all kind of feels me like It's speaking to the same lower, the same stream of direction.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Jason. Yeah, I think the well, one I think unity is kind of where we are from, and fragmentation is what we've worked our way into

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:29.000
So. so we're just returning or or adapting the I I keep going back to kind of complexity thinking and knowing.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
There's all this activity and action happening and if if slicing from one lens.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
It could look like chaos, and actually be chaos unless there's an attractor.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And so I keep thinking of, You know is this a forum for the attractor that allows people to test against that which is kind of coming together in whatever form it's coming together.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And so so as the attractor, some set of unity as the attractor, some set of principal, and people call the goals principles, is one, I think, of values.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Metrics that says this is this is how you play.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:19.000
If you want to play, and then a lot of what I hear is is this kind of feels like a community of practice.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Perspective. And so when I was thinking of community practice, they are resource, and they have very specific role.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Some roles are for connecting some roles are for holding them, you know, material.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So. So we have different people who have these strengths already, but they tend to be resources in a way that

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
There is an allocated time either paid for or recognized.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:53.000
The attention that's given to allocate that time in a way that allows other people to come and come out onboarding in a community practice as a key process.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So there's a lot of a lot of those things that come to mind. and and if there's a place where people can connect to take what they're working on and passionate and see how it plays into this attractor or

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
not It would allow. then people to then figure out, Where do they need to connect?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And how does that emerge versus control it?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So it's interesting, you know weave that what you just said that emergence and control back into Michael's comment on mycelium and Wendy's comment on vision and values and into what you said Jason on

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
on the attractor right so that it's almost like There's this: there's the establishing of the North Star.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
The values, the shared goals, the principles the boundaries in which the the play can manifest.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And then there's the the passionate goal directed play that that happens.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
But it takes kind of the structuring. So Wendy would.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:10.000
I think you were saying in the chat is it take some level of architecture or coherence from the top to set that vision and directory and boundaries, and the the container in which the Blake and manifest and then once

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:23.000
that's all structured, then it can become about passion and play and cultivation, and all those things and so that that's kind of the bolt, and that we're trying to thread and then you layer on this issue of

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
coordination. it's like Okay, as we're all passionately playing?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
How do we more more effectively play each day than we played the day before?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Right. So so I think those things are all coming together, and the one other just that I want to weave in is coming in.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:52.000
So so much is this desire for decentralization and sovereignty and autonomy, and all those things, and every single week i'm on people with on the phone, with people who are so frustrated because you end

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:06.000
up kind of flaylink, right? So I think what Wendy was just saying about how those things come together like how you can both have total sovereignty and autonomy among teams that are are going but also

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:16.000
the the goal direction, the values, the coordination and the things that allow that to actually, you know, accomplish something that that's maybe where the magic would be.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Wendy, e

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Here we go. so, Jason, thank you very much for that.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And I think that you've brought in a level of thinking that I think that we need to get better at So if we're going to keep this sort of paradox of people wanting to provide structure to people who will fight it if

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:58.000
that structure doesn't seem to serve their needs and and waiting to see what it is that you produce, and finding out if what we produce is actually useful to them or not, which is often disappointment.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
If that makes sense, you know, we this deep listening to people, anyway.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:14.000
The main point here. I want to make is that this a lot of the reason that we have problems is because we try and force structure where structure can't be forced.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
So we try and force order into a system. people will resist that if that order doesn't seem to be delivering what it is.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And so you have to be very careful to make sure that we understand how complexity works, which is why I like what Jason, his and we our job really is just to create.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I guess if I say the theory, but the the practice theory around a space that could actually help people and understand whether it actually is doing that, or whether it's just disappointing them in new new and different ways, because people will jump right out of

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
that one and into another one which is what's happening again and again and again and again and again.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:11.000
So while we've got the capacity to provide structure the minute that structures not right, people go another place which is just repeating the pattern again. it's like, if not this community, then that community but no one's

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
actually listening to the experience of the people that are coming in really deeply, and that experience has got a lot of variety in it.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
But some similarity. So my point here is one I do think that we need to get good at.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:35.000
If I say the theory of how complexity works and emergence works which I haven't seen yet not properly, but the words are coming in like attractors.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
One of those words, and this acknowledged the fact that this paradox will always exist.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:58.000
People jump between order and unorder disorder, they'll jump around those spaces and make noise in our world, and make noise in their own world, because we have to be patient for it to come out of our shared experiences to say this

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:11.000
rough flee works and because it roughly works better than anything else, I've seen i'm staying in this one spot, and unless you give people that feedback and they can give themselves at feedback, the system doesn't steady it

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:24.000
just keeps on making more, and more. noise. so jason what I really like is your bringing that language in, and you know you know I on a dead stones work, and such this is the energy we've got to be able to see what

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:36.000
the energy of people's actual experience is of the structures that just steady things are little bit just in enough for somebody go off and do the next thing in a solid way.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
So. i've put forward that you know we should I we should we can.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:52.000
We can concentrate on a specific project like what Jason's been doing in one particular community to actually hear how change took place in that community.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
We would have a way of studying our own practice around the structures that worked and didn't work, and learn from that.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:11.000
It would give us a way of learning quickly as a group from somebody who's actually been running something for a period of time in a context that's close enough to you in the States.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Now this is the kicker if you try and do the same thing in another community somewhere else. you're gonna learn different lessons, but they'll have a roughly similar thing like don't tell people what they must do helped them learn

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:40.000
What works for them is a this attention between those 2 things so roughly don't force them into a gives them an opportunity to learn what works and get that feedback is a better rule.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So I guess that's a little messy but a the language, complexity, and change at the top level to steady our group.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Don't force structure on people help them learn what structures work for them and help them with those structures and locally and really pay attention to the experience that people are having of their own system as paying attention to the experience we're

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
having of our system, because the 2 have got to get strong together.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Could you repeat that if you repeat that last bullet point?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
So you said, No, of course, we experience, we experience our own mess.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:29.000
So the the the extent to which we are good at listening to other people will be reflected in our own system.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So if we are confused because we don't have a theory of change.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:42.000
We don't understand how complexity and emergence work we will force that into other people and other people will actually tell us that in a very subtle way.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:56.000
So while they're growing as an organization, we need to deeply listen to our own experience, which is partly what we're doing and and pick the energy of that, and how well it is working, and how well it is not working as

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
real time feedback, because if we don't pay attention to our own system, we can't do it for someone else.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And now let us know they are letting us know you bring 2 new people in.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.000
They'll tell you this is what i'm not getting from what you're trying to do, and then we need to go upstream and find out why that is so.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:30.000
I think part of it is that we don't have a language of complexity and change that we are constantly hanging our messaging in actions on emergency is hard, especially in in Western culture.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Where everyone expects it to be. You can build a dam, and the dam will hold water in Australia.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:47.000
I can show you that you Just build a dam and the water will rain exactly where it's going to rain and will flow exactly where it's going to flow, and you can it might not rain when you've built the dam that

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
there's water around you're just not gonna find it where you expected to find it.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
It should be in this place, and it turns up everywhere else.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
So Maybe not as clear as I would like that to have been.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:11.000
But language of complexity, change, management. Listen to ourselves. Listen to other people help them where they're at track it.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah, hold on to me

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:33.000
That was great, Wendy, you said that when it wasn't as where, as you'd like to be in. and you said that perfectly clear posing summary that we do and and I hope I got so, thank you Well, said and Well, processed

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
appreciate that

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Just thank you, everyone for it. conversations i've been sitting back and kind of listening, and just taking in what is that we're saying, and I think that as a group now we've come a certain way together, and we can probably all say some of the same

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
things, and then we say some of the things that are, you know, specific.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And one of the things that we are seeing think it's dangerous, although it's also useful.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000
But probably not helpful. This notion that there are other people who have experience, and somehow we're gonna learn from it.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
The world is full of white papers and speakers and experts and consultants.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And yeah, really around the world, those sorts of experience some of them is very good and entirely relevant.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000
If it hasn't worked so far then it's not going to work with us unless we do something very different.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:56.000
I think that if we just be aware, of that we can't me, that's a pass that doesn't work any better than what's out there already. No, I would hire experts when I expertise is needed absolutely or I would

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
need, if I work to have facilitator or builder, or anything like that, and expertise absolutely bring them in.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
But I think that for us learning from other people's wisdom and experience is kind of off the table.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000
If we're honest enough about our own humanity and that of pretty much everybody else. We're not that much better than everybody else, and so we're not that much better than everybody else can't really expect ourselves.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:30.000
To learn that much from everybody else's wisdom without reluctance. just don't do that. I don't know why, but we don't.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Then there is another, another open avenue I think i'm best niece.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.000
The dog is in Advance and the other open avenue is to do something that we have been doing pretty well here.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I think it's very much like jason's and Wendy East comments, you know, with some qualifiers right, and what we get to do is we get to manage the energy we get to manage what it feels like get to

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
manage. What we feel like is possible that other people will also feel oh, no!

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:26.000
When they're at i'm assuming we all know what it's like to join something that is sort of snowballing and getting bigger and getting more exciting, and the feel of that and the energy of that or catching or catching that

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:39.000
kind of a weight. Sometimes it just happens, but most of the time it's created and then sustained, and then repaired and broken, and then brought in again. it's often not articulated that way.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000
But very good leaders know how to do that for example, very good groups know how to hold that specialist. if they are able.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:45:06.000
It's a conversant whatever the language they use it's our conversant experiential and holding the coherence that emergence can happen that is very energized, and that is individually energizing as well as energizing to the

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:16.000
group, and in that case, that's also wisdom sort of in the air that is arising, and an experience of that arising, we know when that's good, and when that's not good.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:30.000
So i'm just wondering how much didn't have an answer we're speaking into the space what's there. i'm i'm thinking my wondering i'm wondering how much for work to be masters not of

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:40.000
marketing that's more. let's take on a big kind of a thing, and you know I I go for it somehow like things marketed to me a time.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:56.000
If it's truly a and experience. of emergence that keeps energizing us, and we are actually holding the container of that while we're listening to the emergence.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Because why don't they? and You can listen with wisdom you can look at with intellect?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
You can listen with analyses. you can listen to other people's work, unless a resistance ratio.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:16.000
But right now we have been listening, and we've been saying that around the world there is different groups that are moving in the same direction that are doing different things, but generally they're you know, doing the one thing and moreover, they want

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:32.000
to come together, and they talk about coming together and even so they don't know how to get along, and how to handle themselves in each other, and you know none of us do that sort of listening to what is emerging and if we get good at

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
listening to what is emerging, and we get ourselves. energizing it's not just sort of hopeless focus.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Talk. This is the this truly is mean can't can't prove it other than just invite people along.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
But having work with innovation and innovation that are innovating as an innovation's under for the last 22 years.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
It's it's a daily thing it's a normal thing.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000
It's a natural thing, but everyone does it well but when it's done, well recognize it as an experience people want to join the company.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
They want to be in that team. They don't want to leave Uncle Charmer.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Precisely another example of the emergence, and you know how to engineer it, and how to leave groups with it.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Maybe where that leads me here is that if while we're still figuring out that the number one thing I agree the most important thing is how to get along well with each other, and ourselves hard while we're working on that if

00:47:40.000 --> 00:48:02.000
we were to be able to very intentionally, and in in precise awareness, create a and experience which includes structure and processes and energy and ways of showing up and ways of bringing people in, and then all that practical stuff.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
But if we were able to create an experience, feel, and you just recognize.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
And you say I want more than that. and then this that experience is not a performance.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
It's not like something you pay and then you see something on the stage.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:27.000
You go home, but it's an experience that is a fully engaged experience, and some of the magic or the natural rules that already exist will start working on our behalf.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:38.000
That's my Guess and when I say the magic of the natural world. One of them is everything's connected already. one's connected already asks physics, biologists.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:48.000
They can explain the science behind it. Ask others. We we we know it right, and some of that is going to have a space to come out more.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.000
We need to be able to listen, and some of that listening happens in these old spaces and containers of emergency.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:08.000
But they need skills. However, if you engineer the experience such that you just wanna be part of that, and you also keep the practical.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:27.000
You move forward whatever direction you decide to. go People are much more likely to stick around and so stick around. They're much more likely to produce something of value unrelated. But you know related in that it's about not a project concept for me

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:43.000
the most valuable aspect is the potential to connect, aggregate, serves, and thus put visible value on all these different efforts as opposed to having the fragmented set of.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
You know, multiple but invisible and not respected and not fully valued, and organizations.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:04.000
And by that way I don't mean just monetary value although that was also gifts really right, and it just sounds, and being being made visible as a possibility that one can now believe in hope.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And enjoy it. and then you twos We join there's bigger than an alphabet soup.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Of many different doers, and if you can get that somehow held in that kind of experience where there's support and service as well as emergence.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:53.000
That'll be very hard to very hard to break think in some ways before I think of engineering something that's something to, and it's probably more doable than we think

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Just just providing a moment for specific that

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:18.000
This is A. This is an amazing concept, thinking that we actually may have the agency as creatively conscious beings too engineer, the type of experience.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
And then by as a design building that's like so close to my heart.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000
So it's amazing to hear you talking about kind of the energy and magic of the space that we by a call.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:44.000
But thanks, Brad! that that space in that field great to see you, that would that we all need.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And then the idea that we proactively engineer that is, and then back to back to what?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:08.000
The super powers of this group that might be it's like what, since we can't go out, you know the that's a dozen of us that are here, we can't go out and accomplish the global goal that we can go out and

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:17.000
accomplish is engineering, that that space and resources and technology and field that would allow for all that to manifest.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000
All right Bill

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Yeah, I have a half a series of half formed thoughts on notes here.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:37.000
So I might institute that there is no stupid comment, rule at some point we're gonna try to be coherent as as Kilo was.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
But I I hear unity convening shepherding.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Bill said, aggregating I think there's I think there's something important about transparency to when we're talking about connecting so many super powers, are so many entities that I guess one of my favorite

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
comments, I guess from the corporate world is what the Hp.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Ceo said. You know Hp only knew what hp knows we'd be in a lot better shape.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
So I mean meaning that there's just a lot of stuff out there that we actually have.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
We know we don't you're not using that info we don't know.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:26.000
We know it. And so, by transparency I mean maybe if you have these connections, if if we're aggregating and convening, you can see what connections the connections have, and how things interconnect so

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
that I might know that the person that i'm working with during like you I'm.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:45.000
A design build might be an electrical contract if they also worked on a similar contractor, and they know assignments, or you know, to see it, to follow the route of other people's networks right Now that's kind of hidden in some

00:53:45.000 --> 00:54:04.000
sometimes it's open. but make that transparent I think can lead to more connections, and in more convenient and more unity that I think i'm hearing if that makes sense Yeah, very much Bill Alright Phil Brett

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Brad to graph. we just hopped off on this illumination of the paths of of networking, and what we know, and who we know and how they're connected.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Bradley just jumped off as a expert in and passionate about social graphs.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And so, for instance, if we set up a a node on their software with the this call their software could then call

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Who who we all know and how we're connected and you know dispense with the sales and marketing people that we accidentally connected with, and figure out.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.000
You know what. So there, I think there's a really interesting way to merge what you just said about transparency.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
What Kiel said, maybe about the architecture of that unbelievable experience.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Pragmatic technology in the field that you can illuminate those pathways, Wendy.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And then we have 30Â min left and it and whenever it's right.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:19.000
I'd like to in the corner once this feels complete towards talking about the core teams and functions that are needed in order to really facilitate and hold this space through the next transition.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:29.000
But excellent thanks. Cool wendy Okay, Then i'll make an effort to try to sum up as I go along as well.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Some of the threads that i'm hearing too, and appreciate Phil.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:44.000
You saying the word unity i'm also hearing it throughout what everyone is saying, the sense of needing to create spaces for emergence.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:53.000
I've heard that spaces for connection so spaces for deep listening, I would say those are integrally involved with each other.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.000
I really liked. whoever, said a community of practice.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:22.000
These are spaces of community practice. I I have been waiting for for the moment where it feels right to say, I think the navigation meeting should be a facilitated meeting, where we practice that we practice the connection and allow that to loop

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000
out and around, and also offer everyone in the group an opportunity to share and practical things to come in.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:41.000
And then we allow for emergence and then we share some more things So it's structured and it's also emergent right, and that we're playing with that because the better we get it that when the rubber starts meeting the

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
road, and we start having projects come in and funding flow through and we're all playing different, you know.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:57:00.000
We maybe start feeling a little stretched the more we practice this emergent to practical, to emergent, practical to emergent, practical, the better. we'll get at listening even when things get noisy.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Chaotic, busy, loud and priority starts screaming at us right?

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000
We'll still be able to listen to each other listen to the fringes.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Listen to the stories. Listen to them patterning that is required to help us understand when we are pulling when when, like Marianne was referring to 2 and Jordan when you were talking about how, if you if you if everything's funded, and

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:37.000
not coordinated oftentimes there's things that are pulling it at opposites. and you're actually not moving at all, even though there's a lot of activity and to me that's where the emergent helps goes no

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:46.000
No, no. this thing first, then, that thing or yes, that's good but if we all shift it in this direction, that would end up being the cornerstone for everyone.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.000
So if everyone could focus on this one thing for it right it helps to prioritize better.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000
That's what my experience within has been and I think it starts with. and Wendy e was kind of getting at this as well.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
It starts with this environment and getting really good at creating these environments.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
I think everyone in this space has already had experience with that.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And again. this goes back to one, Dee was saying, getting better at it.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Putting language on it recognizes it. you know for what it is and the strength that it provides the group so that we can use it as a tool and remind each other if it's importance as we go along

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:10.000
There's there's something that's like pinging me about this idea of so key there's this this idea of creating space engineering, getting good at the experience that we're trying to have together everybody can have in the future

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000
right so we're we're trying to almost like embody.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
We're trying to almost embody like the whatever it is that's the future.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:34.000
We both. Everybody will experience right and I think there's something really critical about what you just said wendy about in which that happens, Bill.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:46.000
This ties to our conversation this morning it's like we couldn't articulate right now we couldn't write down yet all the mechanics of how we need be together 24 months from now because we don't know we haven't

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000
experienced it yet right it's like we haven't experienced what life's like on the other side of the chasm in the New World.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So as we try to act it out or embody it together, will progressively be able to put language on it, or like name.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It will progressively, maybe be able to recognize what it is that we're doing.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Then we'll maybe be progressively able to kind of say it in a rough way.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Then maybe put some language on it, and then progressively turn it into like tools or patterns that can be that can be propagated.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But the way you articulated that wendy I think is exactly right. it's like we can't create the tools yet until we experience it, you know.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So it's like we're we're moving through this experiential thing that will get better and better articulated as we do it.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And there's no other way right there's no other way than to try to act it out.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Learn learn what's working or not and better okay for us thanks for letting me process that real quick.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Oh, absolutely. And this is just real quick reinforcing, I think what Wendy just shared, and what what what I was hearing.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It is to me the value of ritual this might not be the way that one might normally use the ritual in terms of having a meeting.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The way you're talking about the basically a ritual is a pattern for a particular purpose.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The people agree to utilize that it's intended to impact energetics as well as the physical that's going on dance between the 2.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So Yeah. First I wanna I want to value validate that by and tie it back to our conversations on on core values fields by saying that the the smartest person I've ever heard talk about values says that

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
organizations. Maybe shouldn't define their 5 core values maybe they should.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But maybe they shouldn't but how what they should really be defining is the the core behaviors of how that shows up, and the rituals that keep it on track right and so it's like So there's this idea of

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
abstract values. But how does it actually show up in patterns?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And I think what I think, what I hear you saying is that is that there's this element of ritual that that helps create the containers in which the patterns can be acted out and remembered across time it's

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
it's maybe something like that does that feel about what you're saying, Yeah, Key.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Well, I am particularly on what you were just saying about values, as the single words are broad.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And really having a set of operationalized browsers.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.000
How do I recognize that? and then as you're talking about Yes, the the rituals, if we're to use that word which I happen to like?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I think it's a pattern that goes all the way back to the indigenous, and it goes back to nature.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And so

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Great. Thank you. Porce. Okay, wendy e Then Wendy, and then I'd like to just save a few minutes or

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I I think i'd like to just riff on that experience of energy, because each of our interactions has an experience for us as individuals, and the better we get at convening and and have a ritual of sharing at the end.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:38.000
How that experience is if it's structured we can create a map of of that shade experience as at the end of a meeting so number one.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That would be that our structure is actually working for us if if the energy is tracking in a way that allows us to say, Well, that meeting actually held together, it had the right ingredients that had the right structure we had its shared experience that

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
was strong or not, so I think that's one thing that is already possible to do.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We just haven't Got it set up I can i've really shown that I can do it, and I've shown that I can do it quite quickly.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But I just lack the infrastructure to be able to do it, but it can be done easily.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And then the second thing is the energy in our own local projects, because if I can see that there's a pattern in our projects that has a sort of lack of say, technical density, or you know knowledge, men, or it's to

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:42.000
do with money or It's to do with keeping a community practice engaged then, each of us in this room, If we don't know something to share to help that

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:51.000
We. We are then missing out on the opportunity to recognize where our own special abilities could actually help somebody else's world.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So. an energy map of our own experience and an energy map of the experience of our own projects.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And then the derivative of that is the energy map of the experience of other people's, projects that we could help so 3 levels and all of its doable.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And I would invite us to consider a case study of doing exactly that, to see whether we can make sure that we know where our own energy is gone for each particular meeting.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So we get fast and doing, getting rather than do this slow version of seeing whether the energy was right or not actually have a physical map at the end of each meeting to say yes, it worked or This worked and didn't work.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I, and not just the discussion of that, but actually as a map.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And then project, and I would really love to hear from Jason in detail about his own project, because that's something that's very accessible to us.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And then we could then look at external projects, which is what I think we want to do.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Having done the local version of how can we help a specific project?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And the progress in that so free levels and I think we're trying to jump to the end level without actually doing the first in the second.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And if you don't do the first in the second you won't hang together to do the third it can't be done, and i'm very clear about that, because we dissipate our own energy, because we can't help

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
each other and we can't be together to help each other we can't help anyone else.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You just gained up bouncing backwards at the different levels of how things out working.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So let's get some maps together. we need them critically need them

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Wendy it's it's I every time you bring up an offer to create a map.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I just need to let you know that internally I go. Oh, my God!

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yes, please, can we have them all? and in respect to your time is the only reason why I'm not saying saying, you know.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Can we have it yesterday, you know, so I I see value in the entire onboarding process and capturing stories.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I see value, and the entire ecosystem of capturing what's working well for people in story form what's not going well for people in story form, and that and what I just heard you say is something we could be doing for

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:47.000
this particular group like right now you know and helping us discover where the energy is, and where the energy isn't, and I I think there's huge value there, and would welcome any efforts to that end and and how long those

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000
lines. I just wanted to voice what I put in the chat, which is, we are talking and exploring together about what environments create emergence.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And there are some people who have done this work that is their life's work.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I know 2 groups now who that is their life's work and what they've been spending their time on so we can definitely tap into it.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Doesn't mean there's not more to be uncovered or learned, or grown from or explored.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:24.000
But we can definitely Learn from the tools they've already discovered and helping us create those spaces more quickly, more easily, with less frustration, less retro necessary.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And then build on top of it. So before, when I was talking about having space facilitated, I mean facilitated by those people who already know how to structure the best emergent spaces that we know how to structure it at right

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.000
now

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Beautiful.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Take stick, just a moment let's take a moment of quiet, and then let's turn our attention to what's next?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And 9, or what? ,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Okay. So

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
First of all, that was absolutely incredible. I was february taking notes

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Which we will, you'll post I think we have a pretty good was discussed.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't know what you all are experiencing but to me.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It feels phenomenally cohesive between conversations that that happen this week, and it all feels like it's pointing us in a really good business

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:43.000
So

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I will, I guess, said Worth, a hot potatoes there.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
There was a couple of conversations that emerged on getting really clear.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
What teams we need to facilitate at a reasonable level of excellence.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
In order to hold this space for this emergence to occur.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:19.000
We have a aable group on that calls, and a lot of people that are on these calls, and a lot of like partnership potentials waiting.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So i'm curious about so next week i'm gonna be in Estonia when I come back.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Alright. I think that if we set up

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Something like 4 to 7 high functioning teams that were the key teams that were general.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So if we if we thought that around each of the 17 sdgs, or something like that, that the ontology doesn't matter. so let's say there's all these specific verticals, and then and

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:12.000
let's let's pretend and imagine that phenomenal working groups and contests and resources are available to advance the things that are happening.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
The precursor to all those things Flourishing is us nailing the core groups.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That kind of cross cut and and hold this space for all of those to emerge.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And so if I and and I wanna honor pete's admonition of me earlier today, and on our call, spend my time in the right yeah and not do the wrong the wrong things that aren't helpful or

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:57.000
about so next week i'll be in estonia when I come back i'm thinking about how to restructure kind of our weekly rhythms and i'm thinking that the question space might be a series of a few

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
teams that I can spend time with each week. that can kind of this.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So the hypothesis is that We need a resource team.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:21.000
That's a resources to that's working on raising funds for the network of funds that will facilitate different areas.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
We've had a standing resource in group meeting with some beautiful people that are on this call, and that aren't on this call.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And we're about to get help from other networks to really broaden that resource in team.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So I would think that that one core team that needs to be really highly functioning is the team that's figuring out how to go out and map out and connect resources.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Thanks. so that's one team that I would love to be spending time with every week and getting operating the best level we can.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:10.000
A second team is and and i'm also honoring Again Pete's suggestion that and our collective discernment that there's all these amazing people projects passion out there.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What's missing is the ability to resource those things in the right sequence.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:27.000
So that resource piece is critical. another thing. that that we've arrived at is the need for a social architecture team purely at the experiential side of things.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:34.000
So how are people experiencing whatever it Is that we're doing or is trying to emerge through us?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:44.000
How are people experiencing that as they encountered for the first time, conceptually, or in an idea, as they move into increase engagement?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
How are they experiencing the community, the tools, the processes, all those different things?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Keeler I I think that it's like function that his quarter what you were talking about about engineering that space or engineering the experience that's had right.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000
That's the core function of that social architecture group really pay attention to an architect experientially what's happening.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So there's a resource in group there's a social architecture team.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:27.000
There's there's some kind of a techslash infrastructure death.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I don't know what that looks like yet or how it gets configured. but there's a whole bunch of people building solution and tools and service all of this.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
So Pete was saying, like a whole bunch of us are infrastructure builders.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We want to serve the broadest groups we can we know it's gonna cross kind of a bunch of these.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:50.000
So there's a certain group of people who is working anywhere to build tools, technology.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And if what was most valuable was a able to be prioritized and executed on and sprints across the different things that are moving, that could be super super high leverage, and there's some energy around that 14 resources into social

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:23.000
architecture team, 3 some kind of tech structure depth bye team 4 is some kind of core group that's working on the highest level of abstraction That's not that's not siloed into any

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:38.000
one of those slots, but is responsible for across those and kind of coordinating and holding space and prospollinating information, and helping listen deeply prioritize lead whatever you want to call them.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So so the function of that core group is to the servants and you know, coordinators and leaders of everything that's emerging and making sure that thing is functioning

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The fourth area that's emerging through let's say when the and Klu and yeah is the idea of and we wanna call this.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:19.000
But let's say wisdom circles but that groups of

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Groups that the community recognizes as exceptionally wise, insightful, sensitive, thoughtful, discerning individuals who are watching the process unfold, paying a deep attention to the patterns and emergence, and throwing red flags.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
On the field. if anything going off track with any of the patterning or integrity.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:59.000
That's gonna be really really critical as we start to engage resources to have that that kind of transparency and check

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And then the the fifth one. that I don't know if we have the energy present or or not time is on the the cross cutting process side of all this.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And so there's in a system that's trying to bring people together.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:30.000
The mapping of that total set of processes and like how it's working the way that it's working, and why it's super super critical.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So I know that Wendy's been doing a lot of of mapping of the Lars.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I've been doing a lot on that I area and Wendy.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Our starting to collaborate a bit on those flows, and how they serve Meta Project how they serve planetary care.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But that that you like process and low mapping to me like undergirds.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The ability to have a experience. right? So if you was talking about engineering experience, that whole process and flow mapping, getting done documented and then operationalize me. A tech to me is like the foundation of the understanding of the articulated way that those

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
spaces are held so that's some kind of a process component

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So those are the 5 core things that are top of of mind.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I think right now, and and let's say that over the next Bill says it's 6.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Okay, Yeah, Bill says it's 6 thank you bill but if those things were to emerge with with reasonably functioning and coordinated things around them.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
That basic set that, I think, allows over the coming period all the verticals to emerge that are served right.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So we have all the specific areas of focus but they'll all kind of be very so. Thank you.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Thanks, Jordan. I

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Thanks, Jordan. I I love those teams, and I have a caution flag to throw kind of which is, I want to make sure that we balance essentially overhead and execution.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:27.000
So most of the meta project when it's full blown when there's a 1 million people doing metaproject work are going to be execution.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:35.000
People There're going to be getting stuff done in the field with other people building stuff.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Maybe sometimes software and whatever most of the people people are doing stuff the teams that we've got here are kind of like the the coordination layer, and that's I don't know for a 1 million people I don't

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
know if it's 10,000 people or 50,000 people or something like that.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But it's not a 1 million people doing the overhead it's a 1 million people doing the work right so because of who we are, because of where we are.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000
We're looking to the future where futurists were we're both.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We're, seeing that in a year or 2 years. 5 years time all of these teams are even more are going to be like super big, super-productive super essential.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But there's this weird gap between now in the next 6 months, where I want to make sure that we're doing these things, and we're facilitating each other.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But I don't think that it shouldn't counterweight actual stuff getting done, and I think it's tempting to build for the future, even.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But I think that's the wrong way. to do it I think the thing to do is to make sure we're doing at least half real work and half overhead stuff, and when I when I call it overhead, i'm not trying

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:12.000
to i'm. not denigrating anything each of these these things is is critical, like I can kind of speak for tech tech and infrastructure.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It's critical that we have a way to talk to each other. it's critical that we have asynchronous communication channels.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.000
It's critical that we have long-term memory and collected notes over time and things like that.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So none of these things they're critical components but they're not.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:48.000
They're not the work they're you know they're enabling the work, and I think it's I feel like we've been we've gotten into our bears almost in doing you know meta stuff instead of the

01:22:48.000 --> 01:23:10.000
work, and I just want to make sure we maybe I feel like we need to refocus into getting worked on and making sure we can kind of manage it and be balancing that significantly

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Thank you, Pete. Yes, and and I. I can speak for our social architecture meeting this week that I tried very hard, and I hope it felt the energy felt like it was building and not being pulled this week in social architecture when I

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:38.000
was trying to shift us from the from talking about what we're doing, and how to enable things, and actually do stuff.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And you know that shift is important. I think it can happen inside of some of these groups, but certainly not all of them.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And I think there's a dance here between doing things that actually need to get done like for this group, or, for you know, like composting meetings and right just the day to day stuff, and continuing to think big in the same

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
way that there's a dance between what's emerging and what needs to happen next?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Versus what's n necessary in order for work to move forward to me. it's it's kind of different different but polar experiences that are that are dancing with each other, and i'm glad you brought it

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:34.000
up another one that I was playing with This week is I was using the societal sectors that many of you know I've often framed things by, and I mapped the societal sectors to the sdgs just

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
out of my for my own curiosity, and that was really interesting.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It made me feel like the societal sectors were actually a better way to organize people, and then they once organized they They then in turn were focused on a goal that was the Sdgs which is a slightly different way To think about

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
it. and When I did that What happened? was it actually highlighted a few societal sectors that aren't represented, or don't have a goal

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
That's represented by the sdgs for instance media is one of those.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So it maybe go right. Okay, We need like communications as a team that we haven't even talked about yet that needs to be a cross-cutting team that goes across all of them and helps coordinate messaging which was a suggestion that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
was brought up earlier today as a something we actually need already.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Arts and creative expression is another one, as an excellent actually emergent force, where the arts often express things that we can't, yet verbalize. They often and there are definitely groups within our network just one tier away who are working

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
on the new things coming into the world and everything we've been talking about from.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000
But they're all artists, and they're doing it from that angle, I think, bringing in these other groups and having them in form.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The total effort is, is an important thing that we may want to add goals to those particular

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:16.000
This particular groups, if we were to form them, and I think bringing all these on together would be smart

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Make a

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Keep the video would you like to to go, or what do you remember?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But you have the bye

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:55.000
So Wendy, and in regards to your request for a project to learn from a real small client.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:13.000
We're doing that. So this this idea of going out with you and backing to setup contests funds and groups around all the Svgs, including cross cutting works that needs to be

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Is a real project for a real client that we need to succeed on and it just happens to be what trying to do.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So we're so we're there and then we also have a few at other various levels of scale.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So we don't have time to get into that today, but we're we're standing right on the verge of being overwhelmed with learning projects from small and large plants, and then Judy I think that's provided

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
great, and set the doing those at different levels of abstraction I'm.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I I wonder, respond? and I don't I wanna switch to that shows after key little talks so

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:12.000
So, Pete, I wanna try to just put something into the field, and maybe not talk about it, but just have us think about it.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So throughout this meeting we said that all the the parts and pieces and the work is out there, and it's getting done.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And what's the critical missing piece is those elements that allow that network to function, and some kind of functional unity to do together what we can. guys.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So it might be that things like resources and funding social architecture.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:47.000
This was in circles. Our overhead, it also might be that it's the critical path work right?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Because that's what's missing and so if we envisioned like 3 or 6 months out a decentralized yet portrayed and empowered team of teams moving in service of the goal that this quote

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.000
overhead. Work like is what needs to happen next, and order for that to occur, and that can occur until this happens.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So it might not be overhead. It might be like direct critical path work that until it happens, none of the rest of this will happen.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Bye. so I feel like So you know, 5 years ago, looking at critical path, it felt like legal, and governance was going to be the thing that would take years to sort out.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And so we spent years trying to sort that out it then felt like the backbone infrastructure, and technology would take years to sort out.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:56.000
So we've all been doing that hard work and sorting out the infrastructure and technology by january of this year it felt like we had gotten far enough through governance infrastructure and technology and patterning to

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:13.000
where it now feels like maybe the next like difficult thing is this quote unquote overhead functions that allows the other things to function, and then it's not overhead, because it's critical path and that once we get it done then, it becomes overhead.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
right, because now all this stuff can happen, and we can. We can minimize it.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:30.000
But I I wanna not so wendy for instance when you say like, can we please have a real project to function to do that like practice on. We might be doing a real project by doing this. work. That's not already out There it's like

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:43.000
back to what's the super power or the ability of this group it might be that all these overhead functions that the network doesn't have that are prohibiting us from functioning as a body what we're kind of being called to

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:52.000
do, and that that is a project in and of itself. I think it is and that until we accomplish that, like none of the rest of this is gonna manifest.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So. I hope, I said that clearly, but I I wanna just not shy away from saying that all these pieces that are missing, that no one's been able to really get into form if we could get those informed over the next 6 or

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:13.000
12 weeks like that might be the greatest gift. Then we start doing all the other things that we can't do until we do that.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And then they progressed to their proper place. So I hope that landed up.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Yeah, Keelu, Do you mind if I jump in? I just thank you.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah, I what what's important I think about picking something is It enables the concentration to flow and for people to wreckage what's missing so that we can identify the work that needs to get done right it's

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:50.000
the overhead and sometimes it's hard to see what needs to get done, or we have so many ideas right that we can't prioritize.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So I think it's helpful. people focus on one example helps us. say, Okay, these 10 things are super important to advance, and those 10 things have happened yet.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.000
That's where the roadblock is yeah yeah Yeah, that makes it so. I So I think what we have is like. the universe has delivered us this gift of a mandate.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Maybe the setup funds contest and working groups around all 17 Global Goals.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
It. it's like Well, that's basically the meta project right? just in a specific example.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So if we we picked that specific example like with a real client of that network of hundreds of people and the Un.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And said, Okay, how are we gonna go? get that we have a very specific pragmat example at the level of the Meta project, and then that can flow.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So maybe maybe it's like all perfectly meeting okay, ke though you have the final word on the meeting that were a few minutes over on.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:56.000
We'll switch to retro Yeah, and this is perfect Jordan as you went in the wendy end, and the I mean, i'll just start speaking, and it may become more obvious.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
So, pizza I loved how you invited us to do at least sort of half real more cap overhead.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And I. Is there much resident? Jordan was also what you say where we have to know what's the critical path, and how that becomes overhead.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Wants to figure it out potentially right. Oh, we may not know that we're in the practice of learning same thing to Wendy.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Alfred's comments and let's take a small project the practice, and that, and we may already be doing that, and I I would

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I'd like to propose a slightly different filter that's maybe helped.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Don't see those things in a way that isn't to oppositional between, you know, valuable and not valuable overhead. and work. and it is the value filter.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And, as I think about financing and resources you know it's usually we usually think that financing leads to value creation That's great.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
So financing first finds out the value money goes to.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Where value is then that's more mining When it goes to where value is leads to more value.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Being created. Then more money goes to the value being created, and other things and money go there too.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And so if we start looking at what is of value what needs to be of value, what could be a value and isn't now?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
But you know between now and doing 10 steps will be that's filter.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Then we know what is sort of nice to have the purpose and what is in some ways need to have, and in practice, as we lean in as a start action.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:46.000
We're learning so much from being in action even if our accent is conversation, then contemplation and insights of time, who don't come here, or we're come here very richly.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:58.000
There's insight there's so much insight that arise in me for those meetings there could be people mining this, and you know, finding a lot of stuff that's because of how we show up here and that's work too.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
that's practical work, and what happens between meetings and how we make sense to that.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And so I would invite us to consider you know what's the value that we have right now that's easy for us to see in this moment in time, and then also, maybe do some kind of vision and go over an arc of

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:25.000
time, because right now one of the things that is necessary, and that would be a value where we can have it already is if we were to have stood up.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:32.000
You know something that's not works we're talking about standing something up, and it's still a little nebulous right. but that will be valuable.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Then at some point, you know one thing has already been stood up expanding now, and it's now humming.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So what does that look like like? If we were to vision sort of over time, What does it look like at that point?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Something else is probably valuable is at that point when it's coming.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
There's probably a financing ecosystem already ready to find us different things, you know.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Maybe environmental folks financing environmental and you know others or However, it happens, but it's sort of a bit of an ecosystem.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:12.000
None doesn't mean ecosystem of projects and Practices and doors. whatever the focuses on external Sdgs or some inner work, I mean there should be internal Sdgs still start up concerned because

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
they lack of internal development, creates the need for external Sdg.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Work. If we had dinner stuff figured out a lot of the problems in the world wouldn't be happening to the end when nobody would beat their wife.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And you know, 5 starvation. we take And then, in addition to the financing and the doing ecosystem, there will be also serving ecosystem.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
The whole service infrastructure. It grows up for that.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
An image of you know, over the arc of time what this is.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:49.000
And then another part goes back to the value question I think it's really important than we have not given it.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Enough. I have not found answers to that question. you know work together in my own contemplation, and maybe it's not easy, and it shows up in practice.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.000
The question is, why do people join? What is it can join and make some space?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:20.000
If our intuition, if our hunch is true, and good, the people joy, because basically their stuff works better when they're connected with other doers and other information.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And you know, into an ecosystem where they are served, and so on.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
That's Why, they would join and they would stay I don't know.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:36.000
There may be other things as well. but I think that's the question we need to kind of answer, because otherwise if you build it, they will come.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Maybe, and the question then is, you know, when things are humming.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Well, we may not even need to know who you are and how exactly it happens, and all of that, because at some point it'll be humming.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It'll be working on the kind of out of our hands if it's A.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And so then the question is, what is important for us to know and what is okay to not know?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And why do we want to know? and you know what's the cost of not knowing things that we should be knowing so like right now? it's very valuable.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Who shows up We want to engage with how we want on board them, and so on.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:27.000
But at some point, it's gonna look different cause there's already value in the system, there's value in the connectedness of the system, information flows and the potential capital flows in the respect and whatever environmental movement you know let's say, that

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:38.000
in the beginning. i'm just painting this picture with maybe there were some people that said let's now call this environmental movement, and there's a bunch of things maybe kind of pioneers, and they became kind of the

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:48.000
experts right? that's usually how these things happen and you know they were fundable and funding kind of would go around, or at least take influence.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Some of that whereas at some point when it's a little bit more mature.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Anybody who's doing a good thing for the environment can get funding directly they don't need any pioneers touching for them. right?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
So we're sort of similar to that system will be working.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:21.000
It is a value to stand up whatever it is that we're seeking end up, and is the value to be in the practice of doing that and using the filter of value itself.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:32.000
If I had today a good story of what we're doing is a value, we could get money behind it, and then a story sort of projecting.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
How else you know it grows and so on we're not tight in that story yet?

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:46.000
But I think it happens so many times. I mean it has to be, you know, has to have a benefit of being true, but I I think it will be, and it can be superficial value.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Money for money follows value, and then it also helps build value.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And if we Have Valley but it's not visible and we can't tell the story, then you know the funders are like this. sounds really good.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Come back, you know, when you can convince me or show me something

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Hopefully, That's helpful

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Can I jump in just for a moment on that statement, which I think is so critical that you brought up Kilo about measuring value, understanding value.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So I am and value to mean somehow has a connection, particularly when you're talking about funding a measurement of some sort and and and some level of objectivity to it, and such and and sure I bring that up just having had the benefit of being exposed

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:59.000
to autonomous that have really developed the skills of doing whole metrics financial value, which then all of a sudden changes the entire picture compared to the way it's typically done.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But I bring this because it leaves it as an open question right now for me.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Not necessarily knowing how to, even if one wanted to approach understanding the value and putting something measurable around what Meta project is.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:33.000
And I'm gonna honor the fact that jordan wanted to close the door, and I jumped and stuck my foot in

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Thank you for for us

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:51.000
This is great, this is fantastic.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Closing thought, and then we'll switch to retro is that for the last 20 years building bringing intention into reality in the form of physical infrastructure.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:22.000
One thing that you have to do is you know have a plan kind of conceptual plan agreed to in advance, and then every every month be able to articulate what it is that you accomplished how it's advancing the path, towards the goal and why

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:35.000
they owners should pay for you to do it all right and Then it's like after that month of work you submit the tranche for funding it's validated in a rigorous process for third time control so you get

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:50.000
funded, and that's what facilitates the next tranche of value. creation and so I've long had a had a vision that something like Lionsberger meta project with all its attendant send It things could be

01:42:50.000 --> 01:43:02.000
aggregating up all those pieces like. So if you imagine a whole variety of different Specialty trade partners doing things out on a work site, those get out aggregated up into a coherent story that submitted out and told

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:13.000
right, and then that that value is recognized and funded, and then that creates the cash flow to go, do it again at slightly larger scale complexity.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So this is all extremely resonant. I I think we can do it tools and technology to do it.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I think we understand the process for how to do it on the right organizations and our network to do it.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000
We have the right allies. we have the right backing, or on the verge of like the credibility to do it.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
We understand that it out. So that sounds like from the chat is okay.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Let's go try this right let's go let's go try this and act it out, and the neat thing is, we have a couple of emergent concrete things mandates or real

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Excited to see where that does beautiful alright let's go to a 10Â min.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Retro

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Pete, are you willing to lead us in our retrospective?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I am let's do like last week and We'll do 3 prompts one at a time waterfall.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So the first one i'll go through. all 3 but then we'll just focus on the one on the first first one first so the first one is, I liked what did we do Well, that we should continue and let's take

01:44:41.000 --> 01:45:11.000
a minute or 2 and and think offline and then we'll type in the chat and hit return

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.000
How are we doing so? Everybody set

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Okay. 3, 2. One hit. return

01:47:44.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So kind of lots of conversation, a lot of thinking, lots of flow and kind of the sense of building

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Okay, let's do I wish next just what would happen if or I wonder?

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Sorry this is. I wish just. I wish

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Everybody, good.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Okay. Get ready to post 3, 2, one hit, return.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000
When the M. I wonder if you could say more about the pattern created today could be the seed for future navigations?

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:14.000
What's the pattern you think

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Me Wendy Moore, Wendy Wendy.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
M. Sorry

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:43.000
A more questions and more listening to what is the response from multiple people in the room, and less intended outcomes?

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I guess

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Thank you.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Okay, last one. I wonder? I wonder what would happen if

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Everybody's good a little bit more time

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Few people finishing up.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000
How about now?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Okay, let's go for it. go ahead and hit return

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:42.000
The the wonders look pretty deep to me which I think is a good thing I won't try to read them out, but but click the little 3 dots to the upper right of where you type your message and click save chat and

01:54:42.000 --> 01:55:00.000
then find it in document zoom on your computer. These all these are going in the notes as well, and the notes will be on the web with within 20Â min or so.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Well, thank you so much, Pete. absolutely absolutely brilliant.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Hi, Jason, I I love your wish too. we'll try to grab that was here shortly.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Well, this was super super rich and fantastic for me and i'm just. I hope everybody's leaving better than into this super amazing.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I just want to repeat, I feel like through this hard like a core group hanging in there through this hard formative work is allowing us to see things that would have see our perceived some number of weeks.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Let's sort of see merchant clarity is like come any other way.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:54.000
So i'm just super grateful be on the adventure, immensely valuing your time forward to this next season, and help them transform.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:02.000
So on the edge is simply magical, Jordan. next Wednesday meeting or not.

Yeah, I can. How many hours ahead is it's 10Â h ahead, 10Â h ahead.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So it would be be good night right now, skip a week, I think.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Just Wanna How do you guys feel about that? Wanna Wanna breed for a week and then reset?

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Okay, beautiful, Anything to share about? Why, Estonia, just for fun.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Yeah, and yeah, Okay, So that's so jason let's do that.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Overcome in 1Â min let's official So I wanna on everybody's time, officially close this meeting and retro Thank you for being here. so much love and appreciation meeting adjourned.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Okay, Now we can hang out the hallway. Jason. anybody else who wants to hang out in the hallway.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Let me grab my coffee So jason i'm going to Estonia because every time that I accepted a promising to travel somewhere internationally.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:34.000
On less than 2 weeks. Notice something that Yeah. made it a practice just to do whatever it takes to respond to this promptence.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.000
In fact, I I bet most of the people

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Here are that I know I met because I went to kenya on one week's notice one time grap hands orbit, probably ultimately with all people.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:58:01.000
So he lou is from estonia i'm finding out every day new and fascinating things that she's done.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yeah, father's been involved in etc. and from my perspective.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:24.000
We need to learn how it's to serve at all like brackdale levels of an analysis from you're doing concrete on the ground project like up to how we serve and engage at the nation state level.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:38.000
You know. Yeah, and so, anyway, i'm just going because it felt like was aligned and responsive, and I looked 11 served.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:53.000
And he was amazing. and there's opportunities to meet you with good people, share sure information that will hopefully be helpful and inspiring

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Experiment so we'll just kind of see where it goes but that's my perspective.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I'm just being responsive. and then you know do you wanna share a little bit about the inception from your perspective.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Sure. so what some of you might know grand voids Graham's a guy who lives in brussels and so, very practically speaking, and he's involved in the future capital and he's involved in a number of other working

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.000
groups that the Jordan and I we have both been involved in as well, and do know him as well.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I think, separately from in our conversations and so I was going to studies I'm.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Advising a university next Thursday, friday I don't do jet lag well, and so I said i'll go early and leave myself 3 days free, and you know stop on the weekend.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Then I ended up talking to Graham, and just asked him quickly, Hey, you want to meet in talent for a day.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Closer than San Diego to brussels and he said, Sure, are there any interesting people?

01:59:49.000 --> 02:00:01.000
And Graham. If you don't know is working on regenerative multi stakeholder multi-capital highly connected ecosystem creation with this different kind of governance and with this you

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:14.000
know, sort of highly highly aligned ethical, regenerative creation of value from incorporation on forward. and I thought that might be interesting for the to talk about.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And then, once I started thinking who would be interesting people to talk to, I started talking to people that are very much in some form engaged in conversations along the lines of what meta project or future capital is doing, or else in my mind

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:43.000
ought to be and that's a little dumptuous but we're meeting with people who are, if you know, evaluating trends in informing the Parliament. of them, for example, we're meeting with people who

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.000
are developing the kind of future vision for estonia we're meeting with university folks.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:01:04.000
We're meeting with some leading entrepreneurs and artists and cultural folks, and so on and all of this came together in the last 3 weeks fairly magically, because once I described what Jordan brings in terms

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
of just disability intense to the Meta project, then future capital as well as backgrounds.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.000
And what Graham brings in terms of his. You know, practical building of ecosystems, and incubating these highly connected ways.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:28.000
In a country that is very small, but already highly connected where and that a lot of that natural alignment already exists and lives in the way that you know country functions.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It's also potential, interesting, and they happen to be open to piloting things.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So whether or not this meeting leads to you know this this week.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
There it leads to any kinds of files for projects.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Who knows? absolutely convinced that even having started this conversation, even before we have shown up the world's already changed, and the possibilities have already changed.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Even just on the side of Estonia and Estonians who have now connected with each other and have talked about some of these things.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
And that's only going to exhilarated snowball next week.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And so I basically just you know, I reached out to Graham.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
He said yes, and then I said, Well, it really belongs like it really feels like Jordan belongs.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
And I asked I had no idea whether he'd say yes, or no, and he said yes, and at that point everything's been just magical.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:33.000
The things that i've been coming along and showing up and you know more than I could have asked for faster than I could have known with support. and the the chorus and the refrain is very much you know some form of estona needs that the

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:45.000
world needed. let's figure it out and let's see what can be done, and it's also practical stone is a pretty pragmatic practical sort of down tours like this suspicious and doubtful and this can't

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:51.000
be done, and you know, people can keep them pull each other down, and you know that sort of culture like there's a lot of that.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:59.000
But they also do amazing things I can't reconcile how on one hand, is zones are like that, and on the other hand, they've done some phenomenal things.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And so that's that's the playground does that answer the question, Really, I hope perfect. and I I like like, as you said, the

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:26.000
The innovation and and the adaptability of estonia generally, is kind of an interesting field by which to experiment, and it's small enough.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Things that can scale. so that's pretty cool and it's a Nato member, you member states right?

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And interesting, you know Geopoliticals was interesting resources, and it's always forced to focus.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And I tried to explain it inarticulously to Jordan as well, but it's very focused on finding ways to punch above its weight.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:03.000
You know, to politically, economically, in terms of renowned, and so on.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And that leads to interesting thinking, because You're looking for impact and you're looking for leverage, and these are things good for us to to no one's as well.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:29.000
So who knows? you know maybe also their conversations are different it's entirely possible that you know there's often it's said that you need to hear something 7 to 10 times before you can actually inherit for the first time and then you need to

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:36.000
hear it another 10 times before you can accept it as something that you can operate with, maybe worth.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:42.000
You know, Number 4 on the list, and they got another 6 to go, or maybe not.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Yeah, I I also just I think we should take the moment and stuff because you know, 6 months ago we didn't have the opportunity to.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Then it would meet with people like this, right so like this is all of us having the opportunity to meet and share information and dialogue with you know people who are leading or making decisions that country scale and that wasn't present a little

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.000
bit ago, right So that's that's like a little just milestone marker that like you don't know why.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
But for whatever reason. there is enough residence that you know.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:28.000
People wanted to meet, so that's kind of like something to celebrate

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:41.000
To that that absolutely agree with the celebration with everybody's role here. And you know some people who are missing in in this conversation bringing us here, and I also want to bring in wendy, and because in our conversations you know, sort of

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:57.000
asynchronously, it has been so visibly co-emergent and the kind of synchronicities were There's this notion that there's a conversation walking through us regardless of you know where we talk and whether it's about

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:11.000
a phone, or what's happening in our lives or what we're thinking of, or what's emerging elsewhere, like it feels bigger than any one group or anyone efforts or anyone project even though this is perhaps the biggest project in some

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:28.000
ways of them all as human success but it's this co emerging nature of of in some ways being held in this invisible web, said by this invisible mycelium that is becoming visible because of our precise and

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:47.000
intentional and focused awareness, and our being together as a group and articulating and processing, you know, out loud in a group from these different minds, That is very interesting phenomenon to experience when I just

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:55.000
maybe close by, just setting an intention like setting a highest intention.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Some number of months from now it would be really neat.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:07.000
We were working good projects at different scales from something like un level.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:23.000
International efforts to accomplish the total set of global To you know, nation, state level efforts down to sector efforts in places like regenerative aggregate wherever that is, you know, all the way down to supporting on the

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:39.000
ground projects like, let's say jason's working with So those different levels of analysis I think, are really critical, and I don't think we one of those 6 months or whatever that is or some some time from now we have little

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:46.000
experiments going at all those different levels of analysis. we're gonna really test the system and learn you know.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:57.000
So maybe at some time in the future that will happen. I want to set that intention up all right.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Well, thank you. I just wanna say it again. This is not easy.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:13.000
This is really hard work. it's uncertain and there's not very many people who can through processes like this people, have such extraordinary caliber, are walking this path together.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:20.000
It's just so so grateful

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:28.000
The hardest part of this process, and it'll be able lot easier for many people in the future, because stuck through this. So thank you.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Thank you.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Okay, So we'll have next week off we'll kind of reset around some of these teams and rhythms the following week, and I think we'll be exciting starting a signing new season.
