WEBVTT

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
well welcome. Nice to see everybody today. Fantastic to be here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's see. let's start with our agenda and go around and make sure we have consent on what bring today, and why i'll maybe share my screen

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Right beautiful for us. So thanks for being here despite extracted.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Opportunities for your laptop. Okay. So what what?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I was depending on who was gonna be here today where I was gonna head was.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We have I think an interesting opportunity to turn the corner here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So I was. I was gonna maybe move towards some

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Some general updates that people might be aware of, not be aware of.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And then I was gonna work towards translating full planning exercise into a 6 weeks schedule.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And then you talk about teams, partnerships, etc.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So. So what I was, where I was thinking we would go.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We did our needs and offers workshop a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We then did some pull planning, and got an interesting mirror board, starting with people's logic and intuition on the order and sequencing, and I think we're ready to kind of turn towards some more execution, and we've

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
got some some meetings this week that i'll i'll fill everybody in on but that's kind of where I was thinking we might go.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Is there anything else that is any issues, or anything else, especially off of mind, that anybody would like to spend time on today, Jordan?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I wonder if we want to discuss the poll planning exercise a little bit

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I hesitate to say retro, but I debrief.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Is that a lighter word? debris is good. Yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Beautiful Wendy. I have a contribution to make because I spent quite a lot of time with Dave Snowden's troop, and the there's a very simple way of looking at some of the competing priorities that I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:13.000
think could be useful whether that shed now in detail will not but it's a really easy way of starting to compare things that could take resources in terms of what's most easily actioned.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And what is a sort of longer term and harder thing so if we can't break something down if it's not broken down hockey, it will be a way of showing that state.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Okay, that would be great. I think. So I would certainly see value.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And pulling that in with the group. be okay, Maybe between debriefing on the the pull, planning and going into translating that into action.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
That would be a great slot to pull in what you've been learning and working with this week.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Wendy if it's still upward tomorrow board maybe could share that link, because it will be easier to to show on the marrow board.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Yeah, yeah, Let's let's finish up our let's finish up our topics, and then we'll come back to that a little bit.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If that's okay, and I'll I'll share the the mirror like that Jonathan

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Do we wanna debrief on the needs and offers?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
What are plans for that, and what are missing ingredients?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We could. We had a special workshop to do. You breathe on that.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So I think we have a different node of integration.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
On that. But so i'm not sure We'd want to rehash that here we should

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I will just say make sure we add needs and offers below to 6 weeks schedule.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Thank you.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Okay, any other? thanks that people are feeling compelled to spend time on today.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Beautiful so we'll so we'll dive in let's would I?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Let's start with just general updates one thing that

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We've been talking about for a bit this is this is the first time that I've tried to do something like this, which is

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Yeah, their energy across networks with people that are really busy.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And so one of the things that i'm realizing I have a limitation on is my ability to communicate updates that keep everybody in the loop of how much is happening.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So there's so much exciting stuff that's happening that nobody knows about

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I think that's that's a problem so i'm not sure.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I'm gonna i'm gonna put that under issues is how to how to fix communication flows. keep everyone

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But just some just some general updates So we have a certain amount of energy in a quote group that can meet on They can meet on Wednesdays, and I think we we fairly immediately in our first weeks realized that the vast Bulk of the energy

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
is going to need to be moving outside of weekly meetings and small teams.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Bye, so that would be another issue, As what is the nature of our Wednesday meetings?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
How should they change? Might not spend time on that today?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Things that are happening. that I just love to loop everybody in on

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So we are then participating in a group called

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
From the Un setup contests and funds around the global Board.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Working groups all that good stuff so very parallel stream of energy.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And it's looking like those are continuing to to come together.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Fairly well, and so we'll have more clarity on that over the coming time.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But maybe i'll make a a topic here let's see updates Maybe there's a sub node on that.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
That's partnerships

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So we'll we'll kind of look at how that continues develop.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
But that's an opportunity. where we're be discussing with their leadership team coming up.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:17.000
How to kind of combine streams of energy but it's an opportunity to significantly expand the the network of energy and funds engaged in the big bigger picture that we're all moving to so that's really exciting

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that's Maybe then, taking what's a big enough one that it's probably been taking 30 30 40% of my time and energy to figure out whether that's the most significant and helpful way to move towards those capital

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
flows and things so been spending roughly half my time.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Kind of trying to sort out those the capital world. that we need to do do Next and it looks like that's gonna be an exciting opportunity.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I want to give that update wendy and I that with with John and with Zeke, and with Vincent this week.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000
There's a group of people that now has block time on textide, and is wondering how they can help more and

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So we're gonna get into a little bit more of a

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Let's see, someone put a note here called teams check team architecture team.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So So we had a kind of our our first meeting there, just with those few people that are wanting to actually spend some more time coordinating energy on the technology development. Right?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So that's kind of a significant milestone just because we've got some some block of time there.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It'll force us to look at how we fill out our and backbone, and how we know what we're prioritizing time to, and why

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Our social architecture has been. team has been meeting shifting focused towards on boarding.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So we worked through

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:09.000
We're through a couple of sessions on formation that shifting towards onboarding that will hopefully help inform the work of the check team

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And then

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And then what's What's obviously been lacking that we just need to catalyze at some point is is getting kind of a a better chord group.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Not a better core group, but a consistent or group meeting week to to help tie these threads and communicate, get out and across the teams and different things.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So we have plus plus plus on these teams but I just wanted to just highlight a couple nodes that are working.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
He's continuing to move the the wiki team forward.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The resource teams continuing to meet weekly, etc.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So those are kind of some of the key things that are moving.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Where I since we have the opportunity to go now that we have some dedicated energy and these nodes is, we need a little bit more coordination.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And so that's kind of where I was hoping we could start to take the pull planning into a somewhat structured six-week scheduled so that everybody consistent weekly view of kind of what's happening?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And why? I think it would be interesting for us to talk about the minimum communications that we might want out of the different teams to create that level of visibility which by nail pretty simply on a super minimum.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Viable level. So on this 6 week schedule.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:49.000
What is the basic minimum communications between teams? also Michael Linton and open money.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
There was an emerging node of energy around community currencies.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And so Michael has offered his his team up to host.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
A a game or experiment for that would run for about 30 days.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It would, It would require about 3 h of commitment.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Over that 30 days for the people in the experiment, maybe 10 min a day, or something with a couple of sessions.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
But to so that we could get our heads into an experiment around.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
What a community currency might look like! how we start to measure and acknowledge blows of time.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So those those are a couple of the the basic updates another one would be do trips.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So jordan he Lou graham boyd who's very much part of the the network hasn't been on these calls are heading to Estonia next Friday, time, so we've got an opportunity to

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
meet it. different leaders over there. It looks like they're will be a lecture to at a university.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Or administer, and you know, different people and different sectors over there, so that could yield some interesting opportunity.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Is that kind of a that kind of a nation state type level to look at what we're doing across across the network with multiple nodes.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
How it connects with What a country like estonia might might be doing.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So we're really starting to flush out so through something like the future capital.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We're looking at partnerships that kind of a global, highest level of abstraction towards something like the Global Goals, with a trip like Estonia where we're reaching out and connecting to a small nation state

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and seeing how things thread and whether there's any value we could provide there's an emerging node of

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Guess I'm gonna call this sector energy there's an emerging energy that's already always president around regenerative ag with Forest and Klaus and others.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So there may be a experiment to run there on the sector level. all the way down to another area.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I've mentioned to you guys that group of work within Africa.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So we've settled on education as a first entry point into the system.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So that's going to be working with bye to the poor schools as prototypes to extend learning to those who need it. So we've got a really interesting group over there, including a couple about schools

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that are running subuniversity level as Well, as a as someone who's working at a local university.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:10.000
There. So we've got great opportunities to kind of look at education all the way from preschool through university level education across multiple cultures, and how those kind of set and then the last one i'll lay in in here

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is maybe individual energy. And so We've got this node that are somewhat pursuing Jonathan Jonathan Bill Forest, Jordan, on how we set up

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Individual contributions. So looking at, how we can do the minimal thing like Pete's been testing out with plaques maybe using Patreon or different things, maybe something better than that for people who are doing valuable

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
things for the for the community to be individually acknowledged, and have some immediate cash.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So I think that's kind of the updates I wanted to give but there's like there's a whole bunch of those things that it's every single week that I think a lot of the groups not in the loop on that's

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
a problem. So we can kind of talk about for us yet, or Judy next Friday is September ninth.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Correct.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So those are some of the, I guess, General updates. I just wanted to give provide contacts phone into working sessions

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Thanks, Jordan, i'm thank you so much for the update I love hearing.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You know i've said that before I love hearing what's going on across the team.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I'm wondering whether this is the right space in definitely.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I think we should have a space where we can each reflect and contribute other pieces that may be related or interrelated on the stuff that you just said because you just gave us your perspective on all that and then I have

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
my perspective on all that as well, as some stuff that I have held back on bringing in, not because i'm afraid to, but just because i'm waiting for the right time, right so potentially it's the right time and i'm hearing

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:28.000
echoes of other things. so instead. of these when i'm proposing through having this space is that it allows these particular projects, or or to collect to also gather things.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I know, judy's brought this to mind and Wendy he brought this to mind where we need to make sure we're also gathering all the other resources within the team.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Or that's in you know tier one just outside to make sure that it's all kind of you know. Start to help coordinate it, so that it's a little less in parallel so even the game you know

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:08.000
running a game. I I feel like in our community there's you know, 1010 or 12 people who probably would be avidly interested in that particular experiment, and even maybe have some really you know a wealth of of expertise in helping to you know

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
advance it further, or make the experiment richer, or make it reach more people, or to depending on what their needs are.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So to me. This is a that's what I hope for in these meetings.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
But i'm not gonna presume that that's what we need to do with this meeting.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I just think there needs to be a space for it Yes, I think I think that's perfect wendy, and and let's let's start modeling it during this update section.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So I will that's where I was going to like to go next was to

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
We all have a view from our mast of the different things that are moving, as I guess people calls it.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So let's spend I think before we get down to the 6 week schedule apart.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That'd be awesome to fold in the other updates from around the field.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
So, Wendy, do you? wanna Do you want to add in your threads of energy here?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah, sure. Okay, there's too many so give me give me give me a couple of wendy.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I, I and Jordan thanks for kind of making space for it here.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I think what it sounded like Wendy was asking for was something with even more space, more space than we can fit into the next 10 or 15 min.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Okay, I agree. yeah, and I don't know if that's another meeting parallel to this one with that's all about updates, or if it's each of these teams has an internal update, and then in

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:44.000
agile you in scrum. You do a scrum meeting with the team and then scrum of scrums where you have somebody reporting out from each team into a bigger Meta team.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I don't know what that is but I think I think it's good idea to take 10 or 15 or 20 min, or whatever, right now.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
But I think that doesn't answer the the full need doesn't answer the question.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Okay, So thank you, Pete. that was the reason for my pause.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:15.000
It's like, Where do I begin that's the sanctum? We'll actually advance Today's conversation versus taking it to the depth that it really needs to go thanks what peak brought in as and Wendy as Well, in terms of tearing the level

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:33.000
of information that needs to be communicated out to us, similarly tearing what needs to be communicated out to more extended networks, understanding where decisions need to be taken, or whether there are issues that others could help address within a given 4 group of

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:47.000
people. Some work on communication infrastructure would be very timely, and a good investment at the front end rather than kind of bandating along the way to get into the full. process.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Okay, this is this is beautiful. So this to me the last 4 min have felt the most like a working team since we started this, so I just wanna celebrate that.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
So that's where I was hoping we would start to turn after the big big stuff.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So this is like exactly perfect so we've got this little issue log started down here, and so let's let's accomplish the both.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And by i'm getting these bullet points on the issue log about communication, infrastructure, the levels of information, and and what you?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So we've captured those here and then when we when we get through whatever level of updates we can kind of share high level in the next 10 or 20 min, and then we move to the look at schedule start tech block out these different

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
areas of work and look at how we could advance them.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
So, for instance, something like communication infrastructure can be opened up on the six-week schedule is something that needs to be acted on. and then we can kind of assign concrete steps to that so

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
that's kinda so. So how 3% agree with everything that was just shared.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So let's just kind of see how far why don't we give us ourselves till let's give ourselves 20 min here till so 1 20 just to kind of get to get the lay of the land share updates and get

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000
the whole shape of what's out there right now before we we advance

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah, okay. So i'm just gonna put in another thought here that's emerging for me.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I actually would need to do some prep to effectively and quickly given update on all the stuff that's happening on my side.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I don't feel like I can do it very effectively right now, because there's so many threads and so i'm just i'm feeling that way I could take a stab at it but I feel like i'd be

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:55.000
missing some key pieces along the way. i'd absolutely be 100% in for that to bring it to the next meeting

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I'll totally totally leave that up to your discretion when see when Wendy, and as we get into kind of working through things, you can just start leaving leaving things casually, so i'd feel no pressure to be complete

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
My intuition would be that if we got 30% of what was in your head it would be better than 0

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So i'd encourage you just to kind of offer up pretty freely whatever key things as they align.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And then over that coming weeks Well, we'll flush out the rest of the tapestry

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Yeah, I think it's probably about time that we really take seriously or need to have a coordination director for communications, Jordan, you can't do that because you're getting so wrapped up in so many things

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
and you know you're gonna be gone on this trip there it's so good.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:14.000
What's happening with you but it seems like if we had somebody who understood all the technology that we use to communicate and could be a an aggregator of information and a disseminator and help people connect together some of us who

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
have better knowledge of the technologies that we use to communicate and some of us who don't.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And then another thing about Wendy Wendy i'm gonna address speak directly to Wendy.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:49.000
But this is for everybody, too, Wendy. When Jordan and I started working together on this 4 years ago, we developed, and understanding between us that when we would write something for editing between the 2 of us, the one writing the first draft

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
would not have to present a fully formed polished piece.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
We took the 82 rule into very serious consideration, and we made it a practice.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So we wouldn't expect something polished we wouldn't say hey?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
You do. I thought you were gonna put it put out something really important here, and yet it was very hunch.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Fudge. We accepted that because when you do an 82 iterations, you move so quickly to excellence.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:29.000
So I would write a draft. That was 80% okay, and i'd send it to Jordan, and he'd just go back on, and he give it an 80% editor or vice versa.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:40.000
He starts with him comes to me, and at the second iteration or the first edit, you already reach 96% of efficacy and polish.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:26:00.000
So to have to prepare something with a high level of development in polish is good in some settings. but we found that if we had this understanding that we weren't looking for that we could so quickly get things done and maybe we need to talk

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.000
about that as a group here because of somebody is one need to present something. If they think that they have to have it fully polished.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
They're used to what happens in many corporate settings in America, where, hey, You're gonna put out a deal.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
It better be a good presentation. you're just gonna be shot down? No.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So yeah, talk about a little while But that's it for now.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Yeah, kind of just jump in. just to clarify thank you Bill I mean It's such an important sentiment, and I just need to clarify that's not actually not my hesitation at all.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
My hesitation wasn't in feeling I I mean most of the stuff that I offer up.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I know, like I almost offer it with an with an absolute understanding that it's never complete.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
We're not right, so I can I understand my hesitation is simply in that.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I'm. I I am we're talking about this earlier today.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And another group and for me it's about clarity right of i'm since i'm an idea weaver and i'm an ecosystems weaver looking at the larger picture what's

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:24.000
important to me is to offer up the pieces in conversation with us, so that advance this conversation that overlap and create patterning with the other people in the room.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Otherwise I could talk for 3 days about all the things that are that are interconnected and all the possibilities.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:47.000
So it's simply meant that I need time to collect my thoughts about and and sense into what's the most alive to bring into the room right now, because I have my toe and to you know too many places actually right now, and so that was more

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:56.000
What I meant is that I want to present something that that is cohesive and helps to clarify and doesn't just add more data to the pile.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah, none of this goes without saying so. it's important that we say all these things, so we communicate.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Well, thanks!

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I would I wanna make sure i'm unmuted yeah I just wanted to be sure that I think everything that's coming up is really appropriate.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:29.000
There's some triaging that can be done in each of the groups, too, so that you flag as need to need to say Now it's it's good it's good update but we don't need to hear it right

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Now, if there's no action is needed, so we might want to think about a hierarchy of the communication needs as opposed to the contact as a whole in order to keep things moving with the best flow with good information knowing you can

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
always go back with more questions if something is not clear but if help is needed. Tuesday.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
We don't wanna have to work hard to get that information over several days.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:09.000
If the time timeline is essential. But I think we need to build in this concept of efficient and effective communications at all levels, and that means that things happen within a team.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
But the team agrees what's coming out of the team it's individual.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:25.000
It can come from the individual it doesn't have to be polished. The group will help polish it or ask questions that will leave the individual to some additional considerations and doing the work to get it polished.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Yeah. beautiful love that idea. beautiful Wendy. right?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So my thought here is that this information is never going to be stable.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And so having it in a rough form even if it's not curated, at least gives people the opportunity to browse, if if it involves. and this is, I think, where we have to have some heuristics, at least and

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:11.000
probably quite a bit of trust. Some of the relationships and such that are represented by the people are ones that have taken a lot of time to negotiate. and so you know, you don't want people necessarily approaching different

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000
opportunities, will Annie. But just to be aware that something like that exists just allows us all to do our own little part of the work.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Sorry I you know that's where we could use something like sense maker, because people could just say you know this opportunity.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Books roughly like X, and then you know we could have you know. if you know those sort of heat maps I've been showing you we could say, Well, it looks like we need to be looking at this sort of realm territory on

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:53.000
our larger map. So that we can Then say Well, at the moment. Who's got what aware of those things gone which would allow us to system where the heat is?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
If there's a lot of stuff on education and there's a lot of stuff on, you know.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Community resilience. Is there a lot of stuff on region agriculture?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Where were we? just placing our interest at the moment and then we wouldn't have to try, and we wouldn't have to provide anything that was more than a rough shape and then we could ask someone to present the things in this

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
particular area. it's a it's quite easy to do so actually not hard to do.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000
I could basically do it in an hour or 2 for general areas as long as we're prepared to just categorize things a couple of different ways.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.000
You could see it with this hat on all that had on whether it's generally to do with you know money or generally to do with research, for example.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But I know those 2 intersect fairly quickly.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Judy, Is that a new hand or an alternative?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Okay, Wendy. I just did a really rough copy in place to be here.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Your notes from the chat in. Yeah, Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So I mean I could talk about each one and talk so that was me organizing my thoughts really fast, and it was I could talk about here how I think each one intersects with what you already added to Maybe bring them together.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So they're not just separate and then we could just I mean to me.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
It's. it's there's more right there's more here.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000
There's research. That's been done there's connections that have been made. that's what wendy Alfred's talking about.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
There's people having side meetings and have absolutely nothing to do with Meta Project, but always have something to do with Meta project that could find their way in with with this kind of focus.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Detention on particular projects. My dream is that we we start to together.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
As a navigation group start to see where the patterns overlap.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Are we all really working on regenerative back? This is what Wendy Alfred was just saying. Are we?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
You know all really leaning towards regenerative agriculture right now. Wow!

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Well, then, we should capitalize Meta Project as a we should capitalize on that at and focus in and and and communicate out to the group.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
This seems like a thing. Who else has some has a piece around regenerative agriculture?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And and let's see what we can draw together you know we have.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
There's stuff happening over in infinity trace here today.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Right. So that has to do with collaborative decision making and that is a piece that's been brought up a lot. that has already been advanced greatly, and in when in the infinity space.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So instead of us re in this goes back to a Judy was saying.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Instead of rehashing some pieces, we check off some pieces and start to draw in the partnerships and the collaborations that we need. in order to advance.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Some of these pieces. So i'm loving this this is I think the clarity that i'm looking for I can use a lot more of it.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
I'm happy to contribute to this kind of effort and in whatever way I can.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Yeah, Thanks. Yeah, just to to build real quickly on what you're saying,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
We've said this before and if there's repeating almost always is that each piece we've needed to accomplish.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
We've been able to find someone in the network who spent 10 years on it already.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And so so that default I guess standpoint that as we start looking at our schedule of things that need to move, We're not gonna have the default position of reinventing the wheel but we'll

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000
have the default position, and figuring out who had this put on their heart 10 years ago, and has been working tirelessly on it.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
How can we support them and integrate the work? Sorry.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I hope you and to me what advances that best is the communication.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And I think what I heard Bill saying is jordan you you it's quickly becoming imperative that you not you're not having to be the person who makes all those connections and we can't help support

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:39.000
meta project or you or each other if we don't know what's going on

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I wouldn't call you a bottleneck but that's true

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:56.000
That's true. Okay, okay, great so do

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:09.000
This is this is beautiful.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Okay, Who who has Is there anybody else that would like to give a call seed of the pants update from their mast?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Of the adjacent pieces, or things that have been moving.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Pete, you're curating flex interview happen to be be able to step on. I don't have any big updates from plucks. one.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Okay, and one quick update from the Wiki team.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:58.000
We need more people editing the wiki and I know There's kind of a you know, at tech and and process hurdle to get over that.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000
But I would love to help you with it. I think Bill Anderson would love to help you without

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I think we're going to start having I would I guess I kind of propose from the Wikipedia Channel.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:24.000
At least every 2 weeks. We should have a kind of a team meeting of the Wiki team, so that we can talk a little bit better about how we're how we're wikiing together.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Otherwise, thank you, Jordan You're doing an amazing job with a working.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:40.000
And Jonathan. you too, Jonathan. I offer to help anybody right material.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
I will pull through it with you

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:54.000
So what Jonathan is is saying is when when you think to yourself there ought to be a page on the web about this or a set of pages.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Jonathan can help you help make that happen for you, and it would be as easy as chatting with Jonathan, which is always a fun thing to do, anyway.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Okay, Great I just want to speak into the room.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And in case i'm not alone. i'm really struggling to use massive wiki i'm.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Finding it very hard to collaborate in that space so I'm.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Happy to give it one more. Go around for the benefit of Meta Project to try to fix out if I can.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
If I can. if I can yeah figure out a way to make it flow for me.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:45.000
But i'm i've tried a couple of times down and I've and i've been doing it with Jonathan and I and it's not jonathan it's just my thing my way of

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:58.000
thinking or it's and it's not that i'm tech challenged in general, and it's just not, I think, spaces in general are hard collaborative information space in general is hard so just to

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000
structure. Your own personal notes using any tool is, I think, a struggle for most people. Yeah.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
So then, you know, level up a couple levels. You want to do that collaboratively.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You want to use a specific tool rather than a general tool?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Can I Yeah, let me just clarify because maybe maybe there's an easy answer.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000
I'm not seeing that the real sticking point for me isn't writing my own pages, although that also I need is a little bit of a hurdle.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:35.000
It's more when I get to wanting feedback from other people, or wanting to give feedback to other people. I I there's no like I've tried hypothesis I it anyway.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Right. So thanks, Wendy. great thinking and and thoughts makes a lot of sense.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:58.000
We my observation is we don't have essentially a feedback process our wiki. yet we just haven't done it.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
So when I said we should have more people working on the Wiki right now.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
We barely have enough people to talk amongst each other about. You know.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
How should we wiki together? So we just need more people.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And then having regular meetings like, Okay, So I put this page up in the wiki if we can kind of jump ahead to that idea, I put a page up in the wiki, and it just laid there.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Nobody wanted to touch it. it's not linked anywhere I don't? How does that work?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So that's a discussion that we deserve to have with each other, and there's lots of ways a team might help integrate information together.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000
We literally have not started that process to my mind I mean we have just like a time, Tiny, tiny bit

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And so we're we're it's it's not that I think it's not that it's hard. Then it's that way haven't really started the process of it and we haven't started the process of it because we're

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
busy. We're doing a bunch of other things etc. etc.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Okay, yeah, I mean, maybe we could use your help in a social architecture.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Then, because jonathan's written a bunch of pages and i'm it's stuck there right.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:28.000
He's looking for feedback. So that's what I've noticed as a people write pages they need feedback, and then, if stops and so yeah yeah stops you know so forcing

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
me off onto other tools, and i'm literally right now?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Trying to decide like, Where am I gonna start building out more content?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:47.000
I think I don't I hope this doesn't sound defensive, that it's not the tool.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
It's the information and the communication so we're just not doing communication.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
We're not doing collaboration I don't really know about your pages.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So even me right. I know a fair bit about Lionsburg Wiki.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
I don't know about your pages on the wiki yeah. I haven't put any there yet.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Yeah, that's not so it's it's not the fault of the tool, and you know it doesn't really matter.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Actually. If so, let's kind of take the tool off the table and we'll put it back on later, because Massive Wiki comes with a lot of benefits and some problems.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:34.000
But it doesn't really matter too much if somebody said i've got a bunch of stuff I want to contribute to to Lionsburg, and i'm going to use Google docs or even God Forbid I'm going to use

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Microsoft word or i'm going to use text edit or i'm going to use a mirror or i'm going to use wherever the information is.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Once. it's someplace and once people know about it we can start the information flowing around.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
We can start to talk about how to get it into different places.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Nothing has to go always through massive wiki anybody who's making information and making communication should put it in a place where it can be shared.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And you know easily gotten to but other than that you know let's let's do more information and let's do more talking about how our information flows I can kind of make another like a similar feeling i've had for a week or

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:30.000
2 the matter. Most channels are all over the place and I don't know who's talking about what wear anymore, and and i'm pretty sure that we don't have conversations in matter, most really we we kind of you know

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
post a drive. you know. you'll see Jonathan post something like help.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I need help, you know, and it kind of just sits there you know.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
So maybe we're overwhelmed maybe we have too much stuff going on.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.000
I wouldn't it's tempting to say that we have too many channels of information flow and communication flow.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000
But I don't think that's really the problem the problem is that we're not enacting information flow.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:15.000
However, that is happening right. we're kind of doing pretty good. These meetings get notate note taken as notes, and then you know, some of us at least, can find them later in the wiki, or you know, Sometimes they cost post to matter most

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:25.000
or something like that But it's I think it's it's tool agnostic that the problem is really we're not communicating enough.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000
We're not using the tools enough that was super helpful thank you so much.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:44.000
You're welcome thank you really thank you that's great wendy

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:53.000
You're muted Jordan and vincent has his hand up, so I don't know if you were passing to him, or

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Okay, I saw about pasta vincent yeah I'm, i'm gonna ask a question.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I'm gonna ask a quick question that's mostly posed Pete, but could be posted anyone.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:14.000
So let's say, someone creates a form of documentation, and Google Docs or notion that could be in the Wiki.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:26.000
What? What is the current? Can we spend a minute or 2 coming up with a like process for handling that

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
What do you think, Jordan? Do we feel good about spending a minute or 2 without Vincent?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:40.000
I will post anything you want into the wiki at any time, and I offer that to everybody.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I'm i'm the only other one besides Jordan that's operating on the Wiki.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So i'm happy to expand my role, hey? so to take a minute or 2. Vincent: it's a great question.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I one of the So a place to put information is in miro or notion, and if you think about mirror or notion, the information kind of gets buried inside the structure of mirror or buried inside the structure of

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:29.000
notion. So I love the fact that there's information anywhere, it's easier to take a Google Doc and get it into the wiki.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
That's that's kind of a lift and shift kind of thing that can happen.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Semi-automatically getting stuff out of a notion.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Wiki, and out of a mirror kind of like a wiki is is going to be more challenging.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Having said assuming it's like one page like a one page page is export to you know, and marked out if it's if it's one page, once it's copy and paste

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
and then dropping a link on the Wiki back to the original source.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Probably same thing with matter. most right. Oh, wow! this is a great threat on matter.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Most let's copy it into the wiki let's put a link back to the matter.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Most in case you want to discuss it. more. the if it's if it's one once copy and paste if it's one page over and over in notion, hey?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
We have a new meeting page in notion we have a new meeting page in notion.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:35.000
That's an automatable thing even if it's dense a big mirror map you know it's like we're never going to get all of that with a lot of fidelity into the wiki but let's just

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
make a link. It's fine to make a little summary paragraph in the Wiki here's a link to the Mirror Board.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Hopefully. the Mirror Board has a link back to the Wiki right

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And so between between kind of just copying and pasting information or automating flows, we can also just link.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:03.000
So we should do more of that, and we we need to have probably along with.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:28.000
There's probably a bunch of things just the kind of update communication we're talking about, and the communication role that Bill was talking about just having or more thinking and more practice of making sure our information is well linked and

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:37.000
moving around. We need to do more of that. Okay. So this is

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
An amazing conversation, and obviously it's important and that's why we're spending time on it.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
So I hear Wendy is saying, Wendy.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:49:01.000
I heard you say that you would like a lot more of these updates and flows, and we're struggling with the tools and Pete saying that if we had a team together that was inconsistent communication and trying to kind of

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
get that blowing. that would probably be the missing link.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.000
I'd be happy to volunteer time to take you up on that offer to meet every week or 2.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
He, with a with a group of people who's trying to nail communication flows.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Maybe we can start with. We could maybe start with process and then see it.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
A couple of us could take on different roles and just see if we can start practicing how we're gonna do it.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Thanks, Jordan, I I would split that a little bit.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Social architecture should be the team working on process flows. and communication flows, and making sure that things get right. Now we're doing pretty good, and Jordan Jonathan and Wendy you guys are the best at making sure that

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
we get things written down, someplace right let's write down a lot of stuff.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000
We're still learning as a team to go back and even read that, or go back and find it wherever it is. Know that we can find it.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Those kinds of things. So all of that work to me feels like social architecture, and separately I would like to see just the Wiki team start meeting regularly to talk about how we wiki together.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:29.000
We don't really have a functioning Wiki culture yet, where you know, a few people working on the Wiki mostly separately, and we need to figure out how to work together in the Wiki.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Thank you no more People add a note. I love all of that.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And can I just add a note since we're talking about social architecture that the priorities around social architecture right now don't allow for a lot of time to talk about people communication flows.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.000
We're talking mostly. we're focusing mostly on onboarding. so we either need to reprioritize and let right.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
We just can't we're not gonna get through both So it's okay.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:06.000
If we maybe create something in parallel to have this conversation, which again I just throwing that out as a as a reality.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000
I I do like they're really aligned because if we're on boarding into some kind of a community.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
The the first thing that everybody's gonna wonder is about the communication and flow.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So so I think it would be worth it and the onboarding to say, Oh, no, it's it's the right spot.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000
I'm just sending with the amount of work we're trying to tackle, and we were just talked about leadership there.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:43.000
We talked about the hierarchical I mean our last conversation was fabulous, and it talked about the hierarchies needed for the projects, and how we're seeing them, and what we're doing right which might generate some work for

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:56.000
the for the tech group right so it's just it's I i'm just trying to be honest with the group that while that also feels like a very important priority, there are conflicting priorities now that all feel equally as

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000
urgent, and so they made require parallel conversations, just to get through it in a more timely fashion.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I'm just trying to be realistic not saying it needs to be a separate group, even just saying that's that's rat

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Who love it. to spend one more minute here to see if we can get it to a little bit of a closure point that we could then act on Pete.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:36.000
I'm thinking about so I understand that that differentiation of so called social architecture.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Looking at how people will use the different tool sets that are available.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:53.000
I also see what you're saying about Wikipedia and wiki team, and then you'd brought up one more bread, which is about like matter.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Most teams slash matter most, so it feels like like we were 3 weeks from now, and headed advances kind of significantly and bought a little better.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
We would have needed to probably sort out a couple of those different threads.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.000
So is So i'm wondering if we should have that team that's looking at how we wick you together.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Also look at how we matter most together, and kind of look at those different texts, and how we're using them, and how we're cross-referencing and getting in flow like even if it's just for 3 or 4

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000
weeks. I don't know what you think about that but i'm just trying to think that it's probably a lot of the same of us in both those conversations.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
What do you think about starting together for a few weeks, and then splitting them off when we kind of have a little clarity.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:05.000
I I like the idea and and you're probably right it's It's probably a big overlap the culture that you need to drive a healthy wiki and the culture that you need or the the culture you need to drive a healthy

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Wiki and the facilitation you need to drive effective communication through matter.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Most are actually pretty different. They're not the same so I think I would keep them.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Those are separate activities to me that certainly feed each other and talk to each other.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:35.000
But they're they're different. Okay, and the team to bridge Those would be something like a communications team that I guess that would be the role.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
That Bill was advocating for someone who really understands the different tools.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And is facilitating the flow. Would you agree with that? I?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I agree with that, and that's a you know a subgroup of social architecture.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:56.000
An important subgroup of social architecture.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Does anyone object to the idea that the communications team is a subgroup of social architecture?

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:20.000
I think a lot under social architecture. but then I think there's another piece of communication that actually has Mort to do with representation outside our group.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Yeah marketing and awareness, a an informational dimension rather than an internal process.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Okay, Great. Okay, This this is, I think, helpful articulation.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
And

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Okay, given how much time we spend on communications today. it's It's obviously a gap.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Is there my hypothesis is that we should take this energy, even if it's for 2 or 3 weeks into this communication sub team and meet on it a couple of times and see if we could nail some basic process So

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:14.000
i'll i'll volunteer to put time towards that Is there anybody else who would have energy to put on that communication sub-team?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Looking at the process, how the tools are used, and maybe like this, this role that Bill was talking about.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Maybe in 2 or 3 meetings we could articulate that framework, and then we could figure out, you know, how we can resource those and be willing to help with the process.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
But I am absolutely useless about the tools. Yeah. And I just wanna throw out, too.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.000
There was an email thread at 1 point about creating up a new setting up a newsletter.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And I put a Google doc together. So i'll throw that in this in this notes, in these notes. and I pointed out that Jonathan and Vincent and some other people were talking in.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
I think, Pete, there was some thread. It was maybe through flotilla at 1 point that was talking about.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
How do we create more of an automated newsletter that can go out to everyone?

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:14.000
So to me that internal communication piece and it's and it's ideal form would land would land there.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:27.000
It's kind of like some other some you know the news letters we all get in our inboxes. Okay, perfect.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:34.000
I am, I I feel called to to era. Attention!

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Between relying on volunteer effort and getting stuff done, getting stuff done predictably.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:54.000
So we have a couple of problems, and I think a lot of our our angst or difficulty is we end up with.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Why, isn't anybody doing this and I think there's kind of 2, answers.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.000
One of them is delegated authority who gets to say, okay. Well, we're just going to do it this way.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
I'm, the person who has decided that for everybody and then the other one is kind of resources.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:31.000
It's it's like you know I think there are people here who could spend 10 h a week doing communications, or you know, whatever, except that they don't have 10 h a week because they need to do other stuff to make

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:47.000
ends meet So I where this is a Bootstrap problem, partly because you know we we can't delegate authority until we have, you know, some kind of structure under which to delegate it.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:57.000
We don't have resources to allocate but we need to be up and running so that we can get those things, and it's a chicken and egg bootstrapping problem.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
So I kind of acknowledge that but I think we're we're we bumped into that for a while now.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:14.000
This right here is a good example of something where we actually just need somebody to sit down and do it for more hours per week than you know a few.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Somebody is to sit down and do stuff for more hours than they have been doing.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
And you know I I can do some of that I can volunteer for communications.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.000
It means that i'm going to be doing less of other things less of other things for Meta Project, and lots of other things for me.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:40.000
So I I think the what's the so then The delegated authority thing is really interesting to me.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000
My all along My! So I talk about the decentralization and sovereigns right?

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000
So a question about delegation of authority in a sovereign is It's hidden inside the sovereign.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So there's a sovereign that's one people or 5 people or 100 people internally. They have to figure that out, and it's a difficult problem. but externally all you have a you know you have contracts with the

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
sovereign, Hey, can you do this? the server says Yes, I can do this?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Here's you know here's what the research was I need for that, and either they do it, or they don't do it, and and you cure it somehow, right.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We have I have metaphorically taken my foot off the gas of that whole discussion about decentralization sovereigns and stuff like that because it makes sense in some kind.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It makes sense to people in some contacts and in other contexts it's sounds like crazy talk, which I get I get that.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's a hard concept and a weird concept and you know especially for an individual.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
How do I plug in Pete? you know I want to be a sovereign?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But i'm just one person that doesn't make any sense to me.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I can work through those issues, but it's because I have 30 years of experience doing entrepreneurial stuff.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's not because it's not an easy thing to to do how to get that.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So we have kind of over the past few months, I feel like from my point of view, I feel like we have kind of restructured and kind of let that slide a little bit, because it's hard to hard to think of even and hard to

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:36.000
enact, and We're, doing something different now which is we're kind of squishly coming into plays where there's a thing called Lionsburg, or a thing called the Meta project or a thing called all the projects

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:49.000
together whatever that is where we're talking about in this you know in this, in this document we've got a list of you know the updates from all the different teams. right?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So each of those teams is a sovereign. Is it a subdivision of Meta project?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Who do they report to? How do they get their delegated authority to tell another team what to do?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You know. all of that kind of stuff is, I think, up in the air, at least for me.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
From my perspective. I don't see how that all of that stuff connects, and i'm not surprised by that.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It's a bunch of volunteer people trying to do stuff together, right?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But but when it comes to push comes to shove, you know, the communication team says a okay resources team.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You have to report out in these certain ways, and you know the resourcescing team says, Well, I don't want to.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
What happens right or were even worse. And this is kind of what Wendy said.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Right. Social architecture team would love to take on the on communications except we have to take the the piece off the board that's on boarding and put on the communications.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And do you want that? And how do we how do we square that circle? right?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
We don't have enough resources to square that circle we don't have enough hours in the week of people working.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So there you go. Okay, Pete, Your hypothesized answer or interim solution that would work for the next 3 to 6 months.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Shoot. I was really hoping I could just say here's the problem. Hi!

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I have a proposed solution, but i'll wait There's 2 other hands up.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:50.000
My proposed solution is funding. We research some things. so pay somebody to do social architecture work and make sure that social architecture has enough resources to get on board Concerns and communication concerns.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You know

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And another solution. it's a kind of muddle through the way we've been doing, which is going to be painful. but it may be a way that we can do it and and It's probably the right answer is probably a combination. right?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So there's. there's probably some things that have aligned in energy moving, anyway, and are okay other things that don't have aligned energy, and we need to hire somebody unless you know we find another So Okay, great

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Vincent had to stand up first

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I'll pass think that was from before okay great good Vincent: So you've got your interim answer on getting things on the liquid, which is jonathan's gonna help for the next couple of weeks and then our

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Wiki team will get Does that work for you?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Okay, Vincent, to resolve what you're saying yup that's fine.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Okay, and Then over the next 3 weeks we'll make that better right

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I'm gonna make sure I don't know clear answer How? no, I don't know.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That Phil or Bill

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That fill or biddle Phil stein yes excellent.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It's actually steam. but most people yes, first time.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Commentary a long time. listener today. thank you. So

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I think what i'm gleaning from this chat is that we need

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:45.000
We're kind of getting to the point where the the rubber hits the road right, and I think I have been kinda often on the last few weeks.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I don't know if anybody else has this thing where it feels like you should have done 20 things, and you can't figure out which one it is just for work, and it just seems like that cloud has huvered for like 6 months, so in mind and like

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000
a fog. but I I I really like to concentrate on this, especially with some of the education projects that that you mentioned Jordan.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
That I could essentially play kind of a larger role in as a switch forward.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Just kind of pilot strategies of processes. So I I would love to get my hands more into

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
The inner workings of meta and I don't know how best to do that.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:37.000
But it seems like p was kind of reaching. out for someone to actually quit, or more more people to kind of this steak down and saying, You know i'm in.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
So I I will do that, and i'm not sure how I was best served.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:50.000
But I wanted to throw that out there. Thanks, Bill. I really appreciate that commitment to block time.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Helps a lot. So I think this so we so we now have some number of people in Phil's

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Another great example. People willing to spend block time and wanting to make sure that's in the best and highest way

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So social architecture, I think we have a massive duty to, for to figure out the basically with dried clarity.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So, Phil. if if nothing else, just you know you should send me a text every 3 days until you're clear on that

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And when that gets annoying enough we'll have a way to solve it, would you Would you be willing to do that?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Alright, thank you that'd be nice wendy so I think this is actually a perfect Thank you, Phil.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Perfect example of what I was gonna say which is there's a third way, and I think it was Jordan that already mentioned it.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Third way to keep moving and moving faster and scaling up that isn't.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I I admit, may not be as traditional and definitely doesn't really work well within the hierarchical structure.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:08.000
But I think works very well within the collaborative structure which is listening to where people are already excited and stuff is moving anyway, right?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So that we get a combination of what's already really alive for people.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Right, fill it. Come in and say i'm happy to be your project manager on, you know technology, he said. I want to work on the education piece, which does 2 things in my mind.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It says we have somebody else in the education space who is a lot?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Who is here ready to commit time and energy, curious, interested, and wants to wants to get involved.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And I lost the second thing. Oh, yeah. So if and it creates a question in my mind, right?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Who else is ready to move forward on that piece and if Phil is alone in our community.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Then, we say, Hey, Phil, that's great thank you so much we're not quite ready, but we'll be ready and you know, let's check back in with you in a couple months, and if Phil, you know then and then the conversation progresses

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
from there. If we find 5 other people going, Oh, i've been waiting for this moment.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Yes, can we finally focus on this piece? Then we know we move forward and people are willing to, because they're excited.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They're willing to do work that is slightly outside of their skill set, or talent, or something that because of the project itself is so alive for them.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And I think this is when we talk you know sometimes we've used the phrase low hanging fruit.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
We're not taking advantage of that right now because we don't even know where the low hanging fruit is.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The last piece I want to share is we could be clearer even in where we're currently committed and where we feel there's a resonance potentially potential possibility inside of meta project to advance it right So

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm, you know I could say i'm committed to working on the master flow.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I'm doing that work anyway, because this is advancing my my purpose of being on this planet, and i'm hoping it will also serve Meta Project, and happy to work with other people inside of Meta project if they want to work with me on

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
the master flow at any part and any stage in any piece, right?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
And so I think that delineation also helps the group right i'm, not saying as Pete was clarifying earlier with massive wiki.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I'm not saying the whole group needs to use mero or that they have to reference the master flow all the time I'm staying.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000
That's where i'm committed and i'm continuing to advance it, and it's an offering into Meta project.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I think that also helps these conversations as you know could be time. i'm willing to commit x amount of time in this area could be phrased in multiple different ways.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000
But just offering that as a middle ground

01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Judy. I was just going to circle back a little bit. If we want information coming from all of the groups, it would be helpful for us to in the social architecture.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Some other area template categories, types of information and where it then moves to.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Because if we don't have people it's sort of happens stance, we won't get the quality of information that we could get by just a little bit of focus with the team, you know, we need to know a or d or C we

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:31.000
especially want to be able to share that or We want to know what you need to share that we haven't thought of some of those process. Questions would help us build out the actual flow process into one.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That's perpetuated by the energy and capabilities of the people, but not so loosely organized that it's impossible to maintain and find things perfect.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Yeah. and can I just jump back in Judy to to complete the thought there as well?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Which is this is the perfect kind of feedback that social architecture could then give.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
To say the tech working group right to say, Hey, that profile form that we put together is great.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Could we make it even better by doing these things which will help us understand what people's pieces are, or and and on the project form right to work, then collaboratively together?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's exactly what we need to be doing in my in my opinion. There's another piece that I think might long in architecture also.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:25.000
But i'm not sure back to the question of the actual working of the group in the process flow in order to have the teams sort of know how to surface critical issues.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
What's done in dusted what's in progress but we don't need help.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:38.000
What's a critical issue? and it has time sensitivity that kind of triage as an expectation of a meeting that we're gonna surface.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000
These topics quickly, so they can be shared. then We can dig into the meat of what we're doing.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I think, would be another dimension that we might want to consider so.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So, Judy I think that's I think we'll nail that if we, if we can get a meeting together on the process side of communication, we can differentiate that.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:07.000
How those different types create, Basically, the on the tempo that you talked about and then talked about how that information was.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Wendy i'm gonna throw in what's called a left hand move here.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I think one of the issues that we haven't yet. faced and this is sort of on the sort of level that people rock the peat through in is that we don't have a theory of change at all sitting behind what's going

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
on for us you know, with all these issues with what's happening inside.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You know what made a project is trying to achieve. There is so much more instability in all of the situations we're trying to address with our technology and our energy.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:57.000
That makes sense. And you know, if you if you want to have an impact on real issues well wide, you've got to be able to met the things that are unstable against the things that are where you can actually put some method, which is I

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:13.000
guess the the piece that I wanted to take in here so we're talking about putting structures in place, making a lot of assumptions around how stable we can be as individuals in agreeing on things or how stable the people we

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
want to work with are and those assumptions will trip us up.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
So you know, if you and and that's really there are techniques to deal with this.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But if we don't address that you assume that you can just do X.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And you get why and underneath that are a whole lot of assumptions about how we work, I mean.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And Wendy. you you know with the the mapping that you're doing about wisdom that's a meta-piece which will come very deeply from you and there will be a lot of other versions of

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:03.000
that that if I sat down into my own one there'd be some synergy, but neither of us can actually represent what thousands and millions of other people do and say and that's what we need to be out of the work towards doing, so

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I would adjust to start really thinking about getting the tools of complexity under our belt as a group as a as and change leading change.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Because we can't do that for ourselves we have a a first order problem.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:30.000
We can't agree on different things and see things the same way in our group, and work out Why, that's a challenge for us, and be really clean about that.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And the mechanics of that Then it's going to be very difficult for us to be out of work effectively with other people who've got some of the same limitations in other groups.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Big rock. Sorry wendy have you So we're coming up to an interesting inflection point, and then i'm gonna So I wanna quickly respond to what you say, said and then i'm gonna take 5 min to quickly

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:11.000
introduce this idea of a 6 week schedule and then i'm gonna with anybody that wants to help all multiple this back end.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So we still kind of stay on track this week. So, Wendy, do you have a so, Wendy?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I would like to say to you that I deeply value and appreciate what you're advocating for every time you bring it up it resonates.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Is there a place that I would be able to see what you would consider the basic tools of complexity or venture training?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
We would need to get under our belts at this point.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:56.000
In order to have you feel like that was being an address and unsteady state as as we progressed, and if not, i'd like to offer just to to meet one on one for an hour for us to work on that together to try

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:04.000
to think through and articulate what that would be to where we would have kind of a written one or 2 page during that.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000
If we enacted it, would take care of kind of the standpoint that you're represented

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So you've sort of offered 2 alternatives I think it's actually leads towards being not a curriculum, but it's an entry point us, says change makers, which probably comes back to not just

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:36.000
one source I mean i've I favor a couple but if I say it's emergent is the phrase we should always be coming back to.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
There's always things that we are not seeing and those come in and out of resolution.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:50.000
So so from a leadership perspective, Happy to meet with you, one on one, and I can give you a couple of things that will lead into it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:59.000
That conversation. and then I think as a group we don't have to follow one particular approach.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But there is so much more instability and choice with that instability, real real opportunity, just to steady little parts of the map.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And you know some of those things are things like social media, and such, where, you know, you get people whole thousands and millions of people going down funny little tropes that are just not helpful.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So we can find places where things are stable enough for us to make a change.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And we need to really decide as a group and this is where the change part of that goes.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So I don't know that i'm exactly answering your question Your 2 things are one.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yes, is a leader. This would be helpful, create an entry point for people who work with us to appreciate the diversity of situations, and how some of them need to be handled in different ways to others.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And then the third point, I guess, would be to make sure that we move in our library of opportunities towards something that helps us map the dynamics of this because we need to be at a spot that there's a lot of energy in

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:23.000
region or that design our projects that we've got and i'm thinking i'm thinking list jonathan knows that i'm just trying to get all the all my names right some of you I know quite well so i'm

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:32.000
thinking our Jason, he's got a great hot spot in his area of really going projects, and they're sort of low-hanging fruit for us.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And the full thing which probably comes up one level is some sort of theory of change about where we can put our energies to make A difference. Because if you're trying to, to, you know, put all your 10 fingers around around everything and get that right

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:59.000
in the world. you're not going to get the sequence that we could actually support others to go through.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:09.000
If you put one finger against this particular thing, which then enables other things, then you can get this whole Tetris of stuff happening, because the energy is right.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Yeah, yeah, 100%. Yeah, identifying this if I was to say, to give that a summary is, if we pretending to ourselves that we can sequence what we need to do do I than B than C without taking these things.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Into account. we'll put our if it's in the wrong place and not be effective.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:40.000
That would be the outcome. that I would expect and yeah and we do. If you want to ping me on matter most, why don't, Why don't we have a working session?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And see if we can articulate something together that would be helpful and and kind of cover.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:59.000
This this realm of the field. Okay, it will fit into onboarding and such and that because the more people we include in this, the harder we it gets to come back to these original points of we've just got to deal with complexity, and some some stuff's

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:11.000
uncomfortable, etc. So, madamos is a good starting point, and see what we can doesn't have to be, missy, but it going to quickly share with our 2 2 min remaining.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:21.000
One of the things I wanted to introduce today and move towards that we use our company projects to keep people aligned, and I think it's

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So i'm just gonna introduce this and instead of us working on this as a group like I wanted to all work with Bill.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
This is your first assignments. Here I work with Bill.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Is He's very versed in this to take the full planning, and our conversation today, which I think highlight some some very key emergent site issues that we need to act on and get into this format and then we'll

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
just take the group through it and and start using it in practice.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
But I wanna just introduce it. so you're not surprised when you see it.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:01.000
This is what we call in ac a 6 week look ahead schedule, and, as you can see there's there's 6 weeks here.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000
The ideas to state present in the current week, like where this line would be on Wednesday August 30. first.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
You can see where we are here. Yeah, the view of last week.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So you can see what actually happened last week and then you have a look ahead of the coming 4 weeks, So you can see approximately what's coming. and then you'll see a lot of times on these There's a lot more detail.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000
On the next 2 weeks. So for instance and scrum usually you're very. You're very or in agile you're very focused on these kind of 2 week cycles.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
That's where the detail is I like pulling in a couple of weeks.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Beyond that. So people can kind of see what's coming and prepare So what happens is on these different headings.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
You divide out these different features of work so there's you know this is clearing.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
This is embankment. This is detention basins.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
This is underground Riprah structures, etc.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
So you have all these different things that are happening in parallel.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Usually with different teams, and then each of those gets broken down.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:07.000
So you can see detention basins is broken down. so you end up with kind of this hierarchy of action that stacks up so everybody can see how things are moving.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I'm gonna do my best just this week to do the heavy lift of trying to get pull planning a couple of different work groups together.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And get them all roughly structured into this type of a view that then we can start updating on a regular basis.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And if we couple kind of the minimum communication flows that we talked about procedurally with some visual representations like this: with one level out.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Looking at the the higher level critical path that we're moving I think those pieces will really illuminate a lot and be a very concrete working tool that we can start to work with So So we're out of time.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I was gonna try to introduce the group to kind of how we how we work with these.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
But it it'll probably be I think what happened is perfect

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
This was. I just wanted to introduce this today, and that still got done, and probably most use for us.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I'll just present it back and then we'll we'll see how it works as a as a tool for the group.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
So okay, beautiful. That was super super rich discussion that clarified, I think, for us.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Some really key leverage points that we can advance over the next couple of weeks.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I'm gonna try to do a better job of following up and and getting the different teams moving this week, so we can act on those super super grateful for everyone here.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And I guess as learning how to do what hasn't been done before, and figure this out.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:47.000
It's amazing and i'm just super grateful i'm sorry that that conversation was not more I feel like there's multiple people on the call who didn't share today.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And so I apologize. tray so great to see you here.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Thank you for dropping in. added infinity to the little partnership pipeline, and I hope you don't mind, and up to explore what you guys are doing, and how to fold it in Jason Thank you

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
for for being here, Keelu, our thoughts are with you.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But then, for you, so hope you're doing okay, and yeah, really great to see everybody today.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So all right. Well, lots moving. Thank you so much for just the patience and art to hang in there and learn how to do this together.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And hopefully all the pieces are going to start to weave and invisible becomes visible, and at that point it'll be a lot easier.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So thanks for thanks for the heavy lift. stop share love and appreciate everybody.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
We'll do with it. whoever wants to we'll do a quick retro.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Here, so feel free to jump if you need to, with anybody that wants to stay on.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Do a little retro the call create some action items for next week.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Alright. With that we will wrap the real meeting and start the retro meeting.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Maybe just just take a state 2 min to breathe.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Here.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Alright cool. Well, before we dive into the retro let's see, I don't think we got to hear from stray Jason trade.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Do you have any share reflections? if not, no worries just wanted to invite, since we were chatting the whole time

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I'm just grateful to be able to connect back into the energy.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I'm literally just landed in my new home in the last week and a half, after moving my parents after 51 years, living in the say in one house, moving them downsizing them and moving them into a senior's home it's been

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000
quite an intense time. for the entire family and and i'm just grateful to be connecting back in the energy.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Thank you for having me awesome. I love the color in the background. and art that's so peaceful.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And Jason one day. Yeah, I just on about 10 min ago.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So So I I was. I was gonna just listen in a little bit on the retrospect of the catch.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Some things up we've had a last week was a strive to thrive community effort as part of our community visioning in our community.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So we had about 30 different events take place last week.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Did a presentation on a generative economies in general business.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Alongside the chief scientist for Kimberly Clark and a guy out at Mit in Boston That's doing work in a nonprofit related to well-being economies.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
So there'll be a zoom at some point there'll be some kind of you know, if anybody wants to look at it.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I can put it in the you know, into that work. Everyone that Lionsburg thing is so wants to look at it.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
But that, and I got to Dj. the closing ceremony area.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So I got to do 2 parts of my parts of my passion.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:38.000
So i'm really busy leading up to so i've been kind of bouncing in, and out and my September is kind of real cram 2 but i'm gonna do the best I can to hold

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
as much space as I can for this. What do you have?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:50.000
A Dj. name Jason. it's a dj Dom. Do you take fantastic Alright, Ej.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Love it. Thanks for sharing that appreciation. Shit that Okay, awesome.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Before we go to retro Did anybody else just have anything that wasn't able to get spoken in where the top they are that we can just take a a minute for here.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I'd like to Maybe the met that I prefer prepared, and such will sort of turn up in our conversation. so I can sort of get your guidance on where we might put that in But I do think in terms of the order of

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
things. The communication is definitely one thing and the other thing.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You see, assumption of order is the other thing, and those 2 things actually with the other.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:40.000
So yeah, I think personal view is we start to fail by not paying attention to these things so hopefully.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I've only just put a little bit of effort in I can rich and things afterwards.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Once we agree. Okay, so

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I know it's back up. Okay, so i'm going to make sure.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I add it to the issue log here and Wendy.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:25.000
So you said, in addition to communication which we talked about, you called it assumption of order, and then I guess, Wendy, if we I guess best way would be for us to just follow up if we could schedule a one-on-one

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000
this week we could talk about all these things. We could fold it in and then take time to introduce it to the group.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Yeah, and I think it's it would be critical to do that sooner rather than later, just to steady what we do together and make sure that we're really very realistic with what we can achieve So on the the next.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Tomorrow. I have some slots I don't know if you have any slots.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But so, either tomorrow or probably Tuesday, would be a town over the weekend.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So if you want to just ping me on batter most, or whatever we can.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Okay, great. Jonathan, and then we'll We'll start a retro to the point of that communication.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I noticed there were a number of topics and questions that arose today for which there's already effort and material, and so I invite people to look in the community part of the Wiki for places where they wanna

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:42.000
add their ideas and questions. Yeah, beautiful, Yeah. jonathan will maybe with the communications group, we'll try to make that more visible and easy for people to know where to go and how to follow on.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000
So okay? great. So let's let's start our retro Oh, Pete, would you?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Would you be okay? lifting just for like 5 min, just to kinda get us kicked off?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Sure thing. let's change it a little bit this week not too much.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I think waterfalls work pretty well especially when we're maybe a little bit constrained on time.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:12.000
How about if we do one called I like I wish I wonder?

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So we'll go through those one at a time so why don't we take 2 min and write up what I liked about this call?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:42.000
What did we do? Well, that we should continue

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You want us to write these in the chat, Peter? Just I can do it.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Oh, yeah, I think. What do we think I like waterfalls where we all hit?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Return at the same time. I don't know if that's good or bad.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And so then the trick is not to hit return until You're ready till Jordan says you can use control.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Return to get a line, break.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Or use a different program

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
You know, tried that once, and it didn't work because I think it works on a a Mac apple.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I mean on the windows machine it. didn't work I Think it's alt enter what it I tried that and it just posted it right away. I do control enter on a on a Mac.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Not all not not option. So Then it's probably alt on on a yeah Pc.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Now you could do a little chess, Bill. So another minute.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:22.000
What did we like?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Are we feeling

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:40.000
3, 2, one go.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Alright, beautiful.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:09.000
50 you're still up I think we'll just Let people read through those and move on to our wish, hey? Sorry we're we're kind of used to the rhythm here.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
It. It was made sense that we did them separately.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:22.000
But thanks for thanks for putting yours all together. So next one is, I wish I wish we during this call did something differently.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Did did something that we didn't do maybe didn't do something that we did do so next.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:37:00.000
One.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Alright. How are we doing Minute more, Make it more beautiful

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Alright, how are we doing now? i'm okay

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:31.000
What.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Please maybe

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Beautiful beautiful wishes.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Good one. Vincent

01:40:42.000 --> 01:41:02.000
We'll go there next. Alright, one day let's do, I wonder? And then let's let's answer Vincent's prayer I wonder what would happen if we dot dot dot

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Great problem.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Alright. How are we doing on our wonderings

01:42:41.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Alright ready bye, or one

01:43:43.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Those are really good wonderings and really good wishes

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
This is a great way to wrap the meeting. Yeah, this is really, really, Pete.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I thought this was really effective Today the quality of what came out was real.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I love your copy this into the or would that be okay?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Procedure. they did copy this last section in .

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Matter goes, but that'd be great into

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So there is some really strong one thing that's neat is This is all pointing to where we need to go, but it seems like there's a really strong theme about meeting, which is really great, right? like there's a couple of key

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:06.000
things around communication and course, and time and space to allow for the fullness of this to emerge time and then tray.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I love your comment that tied in with pete's comments and Bill's comments on wouldn't it be nice if this wasn't just a side thing but if it actually contributed to the core of what was on

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
the center of our desk every day rather than the side.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.000
So I think there's this idea that there's some percentage of our time.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:39.000
We're spending on the highest, and most meaningful things that we think have the most potential, and some things are spending time on to make ends meet and make money. and it would be fun to figure out how to turn that

01:45:39.000 --> 01:46:05.000
dial progressively to do less and less of the lower impact things, and more and more to have these things take the center

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Okay, So let's spend would every be okay spending the next 8 min.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Kind of talking about the coming week. and in light of all this

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Beautiful.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So I guess i'm gonna go down to the very bottom of this all

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Section called the Coming. Okay, I should share my screen for the assumption

01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Alright.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Guess, instead of me speaking in light of what our our wishes and wonders, and those kind of things, and our deep conversation

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:24.000
We have a quick, quick 2 min here, so

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah, just just create space. what's what's most important to people based on what came out today.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Okay, So I agree with that schedule. A communications team meeting Jordan plus maybe others to create draft 6 weeks schedule

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Thank you.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Let's see Kelly. we can't we can't hear you getting for some reason Your volume is not your doesn't look like on mute. but we can't hear you can you hear me.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Now? Yes, yes. Can you hear me now? Okay. An idea.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:37.000
What about if somebody suggested letting ourselves or each other know what's been happening before each Night meeting?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm wondering if very short video a voice message can be much more in that than you know.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
He had a of text

01:48:48.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Or do both. So you're suggesting maybe just quick couple of minutes voice memos, or something from anybody that wanted to share just key key connection pieces to kind of Yeah, good.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I think somebody mentioned this is so what if for or somewhere that if we were to know before the next meeting, you know what is emerging, what we're dealing with, and so on.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I mean we're into it and writings here but along

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I think the idea of the short clip is very constructive, because it takes the burden of putting pen to paper off everybody's desk or keys to the keyboard as it would be.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I think that's a really good idea too pete and I have talked that as well.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000
We'll have to think about how to do that without having people feeling like there's a backlog or they're falling decline.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.000
So maybe we could have somebody kind of summarize those and present them out.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:08.000
That could be viewable, that sounds hard jordan Yeah, i'm actually thinking that if those were done not the day before the meeting.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.000
But maybe 3 or 4 days before the meeting midweek between the meetings.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Then people could perhaps help with whatever the issue is the person's dealing with, and it would already be resolved by the next Wednesday.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So there's a dynamic aspect to it it's not just teaing it up to review as a group.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
It's live kind of like your co worker just bumped into something in the lab.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:39.000
That's a problem and you're gonna stop and help him right then and there, and it won't be a problem by Wednesday.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:48.000
It is. Is that something where we could record everybody records 2 or 3 min, and then we put those all together, and we have.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I don't know you know half an hour 45 min to watch.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I think that was preferable. Pete

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Yeah, yeah, would also assure that

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:18.000
That's a really cool idea pete to instead of having a bunch of fragments to splice those better together, you know.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:36.000
So each week we'd have both like the weekly a weekly meeting or 2 that would be high level, and those quick bullets from everybody that would be super powerful

01:51:36.000 --> 01:52:01.000
The call out to Well, i'd like to include in that recording things people have been letting go of because there's no traction yet

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So that they Don't you know disappear I I think people have passions, and they're called to do things, and then they can get lost.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.000
So I propose to let people have a way to say hey?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I don't want this to get lost

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Bill Anderson, Pete called. that kind of a parking lot or a a backlog or parking lot is a is often a good term because it's, but it also means that it's available for someone else to step in and help

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:53.000
figure before the next meeting. It doesn't stand the parking lot

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I like the way Jonathan said it, too.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Something that want to make sure that it doesn't get lost yeah I agree.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And and I think that would be fine in an in an update, you know.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:52.000
We also have some Maus and partnership agreements that need to get advanced Estonia trip, details finalized

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Okay, Bill looks like, and then looks like we're outside Bill you got the final word an example.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:13.000
I was, i've been working on as you know jordan and on boarding program for companies coming into the Lionsburg orbit, as owned entities.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
We're working on this is the part of something that's imminent.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:24.000
But when I heard people talking about the the social onboarding, I thought, Wow!

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000
This probably has some overlap and some yeah for sure So there made this.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.000
That's an example of how we could be working on things that have synergies between them.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000
But because we don't know about them we're not sharing. So we're duplicating efforts unnecessarily.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Yeah, Yeah, Bill, is we work on the social onboarding the next couple of weeks?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
It might be worthwhile having to join the so social architecture meetings.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Because I I agree it has a lot of synergy with what's happening right now.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Okay, cool. I wanna honor our come to the close of 2 30 here.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
But yeah, these are some of the key things that are meeting i'll.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:27.000
I'll try to take these and get them into a little different view that might be useful and and start to circulate that. and then we can get a little better at this, watching and then the details, seeing what resources are going where all that good

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000
stuff, so it'll help bring it to life well thank you so much, really really a joy and an honor to be with you today.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Really appreciate the effort in the time. and the intent That's going into this means a lot.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
So. Thank you. Thank you, Jordan, and thanks everybody.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
