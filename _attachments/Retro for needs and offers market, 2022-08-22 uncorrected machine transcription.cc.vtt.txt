WEBVTT

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.000
okay, great. So we're, here august 20 s then a retrospective for the offered. It needs marketplace that we attempted last week, and so we had some good things happen, and some things we wanted to improve.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So we wanted to have a specific workshop just to focus on the process going forward

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, Benson, or whoever would you like to begin

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I see another minute i'm just grabbing the zoom chat and i'm putting it through the bentley's zoom.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Chat. easy, reader, Just so. we have it in like a spreadsheet, and then we can go through.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I can lead us through the feedback. but if someone wants to do something else to start off There's a few other topics

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I would just wait for that. Yeah, that's quite a good place to start.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So say you can concentrate

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:06.000
On some of the group until we're ready I suppose if you want to let me just save it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay, So I think this is where we started the retro at 5, 28.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So what questions? What do you find transformative? Did we ask the right questions, and what what?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Well. So at this point I believe we decided we would do a quick waterfall on the chat, and not really go into those in detail.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And this is kind of the start of the feedback.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So Judy said good questions, rich input but highly varied in content and style.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So we'll need some sorting so is that in reference to the actual needs and offers themselves

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:23.000
That there needs to be We use a filtering, filtering them or sorting them so so a way to say that, being like varying constant, or style, see. So we ask a prompt and then lots of people receive that in different

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:43.000
ways and respond in different ways. So I guess the issues there that the varying content and and style of responses might require some post processing, and also it's

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The the structure is different from offered offer right so you Can't.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Just not everybody got the same thing in the same place and in their office.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Yeah, I did. I did think that. the prompt of what it was we were just purpose.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:32.000
What was not quite clear, and and so, you know, I think the the answer is, had a lot of room for variance, and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm i'm still puzzling over on honestly you know what, how, how one offers, what and asks what of whom?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Just seems, you know, sort of intimidatingly broad in a way.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Yeah, we that was that was a core reflection that I think Pete and I had to.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's almost like we jumped in to kind of to like creating off to sharing offers and needs without building up like the substrata Almost I think what you're saying of like the context.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Why, this is important, how it best then rolls it's it's almost like we start playing a game without really dialing into the rules a little bit something like that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Okay, So we kind of captured that Vincent, do you?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Wanna i'll just respond to that briefly and say this went pretty similarly to some of the other needs in office workshop. so I've either been in or facilitated, and that high variation of the types

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of needs and offers and shared is pretty typical.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And I expected it. so it is something that we can mold to fit the needs of whatever specific groups that we're running in in for the next time.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And So yeah, I think it's it's a I think it was a good experiment to figure out.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Okay, what How should it? What direction should it be pulled towards?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So yeah curious. if you guys have any just thoughts briefly on like

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:28.000
If we were to rent again, how how would you frame it differently. Let's go i'm gonna make a heading here, Vincent called.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Process improvement and put that question in down. If we ran it again, how might we contextualize and brain it differently? Okay.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So it'd be okay vincent if we captured that as a question, and then kept going through the feedback, because I think all at least i'll be able to better respond to that once.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We once, you maybe have a fuller view of the feedback.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Sure. Yeah, that works

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Jonathan it's currently it seems like Nobody's using the results, and so I would encourage us to figure out a way to make it more dominant or useful or attractive.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So people go. Oh, gosh, you know I have this need i'm gonna post it.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Oh, gosh! I want to see what needs are out there.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:11.000
That's where I want that's that's for my attention is going, so maybe we add a section for next steps, and that would include sending out the opportunities that were shared.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And we talked about also sending out potentially in like a newsletter format.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah, like classified ads

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Yeah. So I so I agree there's like this issue of you run the workshop and getting people to adopt it as an ongoing thing is completely different issue

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Go to the next chat. I so Jonathan said great questions.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:11.000
All presented, I said, I think we asked the right questions, but needed more time to properly come to agreement or shared understanding on them.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So. Yeah, the workshop definitely for me. I I felt a little rush trying to get it into the time.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Especially since it was the first time that a lot of people have done the needs an office workshop.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It seemed to me so typically like 2 h is a what they suggest.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And yeah, I think I think just having more time to kind of respond to questions and to clarify the framing could have helped.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So that was just yeah, one of my main pieces of feedback.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
If we were to do it again, to just make sure we have the proper time.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Allotment, and if we want to do a retro afterwards, it would have to be a little more than 2 h

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It felt

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Got it. So we captured that but let's keep going through the responses, and I kind of felt, I guess just a quick reflection is the way I was kind of processing.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It sounds like the way. Maybe Michael had received it it was almost like even if we had another 3 4 min per prompt or 5 min per prompt, I think it still might have been difficult i'm I don't know exactly why that

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
is yet, but so so I guess maybe maybe part of it is having more time to sync up and understand the question.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Part of it is the pre-existing context and Then I think maybe part of it is just there's it's like

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So i'm wondering about the asynchronous elements of I guess of this almost like the asynchronous elements of how markets form versus trying to do it form a market in the session versus like carefully

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
crafting your craig's list post and going like that they have this circuit, and someone can have it if they'll give me a $100, and you know.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Take some pictures, And then it's like boom and that's all happening, isynchronously, or if it's like, Okay, what do you have in your house that you'd sell for how much you might be able to like pull

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:42.000
together a couple of things, but not sure if there is as much depth or meaning there as as might come forth in other ways.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Yeah, I I think that that sums up a lot of sort of understanding of what the market is before you try to play in it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It's like you know this was what's going on was at once.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Whatever was 7 or 8 people in like a family meeting, like talking about their personal needs and offers, and then thinking about it in terms of a broader marketplace among you know participants in our our larger group and then thinking

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:43.000
about it and public context, and it was just very it's like is this about the skills that I have to offer in my linkedin profile. that somebody would pay me for or you know i'll cook a meal for

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
you where you can stay with me, which I wouldn't say to just anybody you can see like did profile.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But I would say to everybody in that meeting, and most of the people, it was just.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It was too amorphous, I I think to really know and and and it's not it's not really about the process.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It's just about the frame of the process and like When I was, I remember I was asking, like, Okay, so this is when you say public, do you mean public to the world or public to everybody on catalyst which are very different publics, I

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000
mean I I might put some stuff on catalyst that I wouldn't put on, you know, a larger platform.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And so yeah, that that kind of stuff, I think, is is useful.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Framing just like the craig's list example, that that you were using Jordan like, Okay, you know how this game is played. and who's gonna see this?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And yeah like for you might not post on craig's list to New York, that there's free meals in a room to stay in.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So so, and then catalyst like maybe it's everybody on catalyst.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
But I don't know how many people are on catalysts and simple.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Let's say it's a 1,000 pretty carefully vetted people that are already playing in like the network of networks, you know.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So it's it's already fairly curated by that makes sense Michael.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Yeah, yeah, I think next time I definitely would frame it.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
For the concentric circles of sharing I would just ask.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, Michael, like i'm glad that you asked the question during the meeting.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It was my answer. clear enough. or do you still have other questions?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Like. Did that like if you didn't ask that question it might not have been clear to other people.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So i'm curious if my answer was clear enough and like gave you the answer you were looking for, or it was interesting. It was an interesting, I remember the answer just in that. you.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I I felt like it was sort of It was sort of fuzzing out the border of catalyst, just because you said, you know, and I I get it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
You said. Anybody who has this Url will be able to see it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Which sort of made it the case that okay, somebody could take this Url and distribute it.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And people who weren't on catalyst would see it which made that public bigger

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And it was it it you know it's it's still a a bit of a conceptual challenge.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:47.000
You know just how. Yeah, what kind of what kind of needs one exposes, and what kind of services one offers?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
You know it's it's still had that sort of how public is this!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:01.000
How comfortable am I and what what's called for and you know how generous can I be, how how vulnerable can I be?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Those things, you know, I I felt just a i'm less familiar with with all those things, but I I felt like it was still a little unclear and and events, and I think your answer was relatively simple.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I think maybe from a tech standpoint it's simple but I think from a user experience like it's a little hard to conceptualize those things, you know, because it's like cause I think Okay, i'm gonna click public on

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
catalysts, like Michael saying, is different than like i'm posting this on Craig's list, even though they're both public.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Sorry, so I think we can maybe did differentiate it out just a little bit more.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Let's go to peak

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Thanks and switched headsets. I forgot to charge my other ones.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
These might not noise council as well so apologize if there's invites in the backup right now.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I wanna make an observation of a a non judgmental observation.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:20.000
That we didn't I I feel like we didn't have a it's essentially a project plan what it what I call the everything is a project plan kind of plan for the needs and offers

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:36.000
session. So now we're kind of in a weird place where we're trying to judge the successor or not of the the session without any criteria, that we set up before. and right so so I think most of you probably

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:55.000
know my my everything is a project thing but so a couple of things. One of them is I would be super super cool if we all collectively, we're able to set up you know here's the the goals and the approach

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
for this thing and then we run the thing, and then we retro it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Partly especially for this crew, partly just to help other people learn how to do it.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So I I feel like. So my so my thought about it is feel like if what we wanted to do was introduce needs and offers markets places to people and run through a little practice and break the ice especially to like you know

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Okay, i'm going to post my first one and my first 2, and you know I'm, i'm gonna survive, and if it's not perfect, it's gonna be okay. I think we did that pretty well, I I wish

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
that we had had more time and we didn't which is fine.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I wish we had set up what it needs and offers.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Marketplace is more. I I think we could have had a whole session just on that to kind of

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Hopefully, with maybe a few more people. I guess you know what is a need.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
What is an offer? Why do we even want a marketplace?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
You know what you know. What are we going to do with this thing once we build it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:22.000
That's kind of stuff all that stuff we We kind of like skipped past, and that was the the the, you know. Wish that I had for this this session, but overall, I think it was really successful.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I felt like I was like, Okay, I got dragged through making an offer.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:35.000
You know that I wasn't expecting to at the beginning and you know I I survived It was it was great wonderful

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
We got to, maybe another goal, for it was to stress, test the infrastructure.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And, like you said during the session, Jordan, This is great, good job, Vincent.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000
We you know we we ground through it and we ground until it broke and you know that's beautiful, and wonderful that's not a bad thing.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000
If we had a different goal a different goal might have been to populate the needs and offers database.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
With, you know, 3 or 4 or 10 different offers of needs from each person.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I think it was mostly a failure right because we didn't get through very much.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000
We didn't really get to do needs very well you know yada, yada! Maybe we didn't even have enough people in the room.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:33.000
So I think I think if we judge it against that criteria which is another, we need to get to that criteria at some point in our in our maturity.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Hopefully soon. I think I think we kind of failed but I think that's the wrong criteria.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So. So a question, maybe, for this team on this meeting is maybe we can I don't.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I don't think we should go through. developing whole project plan right now, but maybe we can start to like sketch that out.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
You know. What are we trying to accomplish what's our timeframe?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
How important it is, is it to just get people started?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
How important is it to get it populated? How important is it to get it used?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And you know, How do we set those sets set each of those needs up with an approach that we think is going to be successful. So that might be something we could kind of do today.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And and I think we should do more of that before we do kind of more mind blind execution into trying to get something done without understanding what it is that we're trying to get done.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So, Pete, as you're saying that alarm bells are going off for like full planning this week right cause we we did a little intro a few weeks back.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
That some people were there or not, and there'll be people who work there time.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So this will help inform that

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Jonathan Jordan. is it okay? If I make reference to some of what we discussed in our direct message channel, and you are always welcome to discuss anything.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:41.000
So, after posting my needs, Jordan said, Hey, you know, if you wanted, I can give you what I think are the next steps to follow.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
If for you to be proactive about getting your needs met.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And after that I reached out to Bill, and he walked me through what he thought was a good project.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Proposal template. would open my eyes a lot.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And then I posted that into the wiki, and then what the heck did.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Some project proposals. and to me. That was a partial answer to Gee!

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
What do we do next? So I offer that one of the things just to build on that.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
So one of the things that Jonathan, are you? okay?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
If I candidly discussed some of the things that were in there.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Messages So one of the the things that I think Mike Michael brought up is in there we have.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We had everything from you know, Jonathan making a direct request for you know a job or a you know, specific funding, or a ask all the way up to more community based you know.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Things. So one of the things I was reflecting with on Jonathan was

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Okay, So let's let's say jonathan has a need for paid work programming related to these areas of expertise and blah blah, and and he would like a job.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
I think. I was pondering how we could recontextualize those things in a way that might get more support.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:37.000
So it's one thing. if Jonathan says okay, I have a need for paid coding where vine apple products the deck right, it's another thing.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:50.000
If if Jonathan signals to the great light I think there's some of us who have who would like paid coding work, things that the community finds meaningful on these platforms that we think we might want to use

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Yeah, it would be great if we could set up some kind of a system that would help me and others find that whatever.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000
So I was reflecting what, Jonathan, that a lot of times when these individual needs come up, if you can abstract them out a step and then create a solution that benefits you and 10 of your friends that are in the same

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
boat they might get a lot more likely to act upon because I was.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I was. Just imagine kind of Jonathan sitting there 30 days later, Going?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Well, nobody gave me a job. No, but none of the 7 people get me a job coding it's like, No. Okay, how do?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
How do we take those needs? abstract them into something?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:39.000
The group might be able to help with or and so so I was trying to sort out some of those different levels as well, and and that was very useful, and I changed.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Oh, I framed my need in my online and Bills suggestions regarding a template.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Give me a process of articulating the benefit to the All.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Yeah, we go about investigating my need fits into that bigger need.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Yeah, that's how I frame my proposals and I I dropped the one for meeting work.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Yeah. and then and then, Jonathan. and just this is a twenty-second comment that we should get back to the retro.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000
But you can then expect those to like if you do a project proposal, and it's not acted on immediately by the group, just because you do a proposal doesn't mean it's the top priority this week.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
For everybody in the group. right? so you can expect, like you see, a need.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
It turns into maybe something that can solve problems for multiple members of the community.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Right, then you need to expect that to get kind of stacked and queued up against all the things we could spend time on this week, and then we need to go through kind of a discernment process to go Okay, in light of

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:59.000
all these needs? What are the ones that are shared by the most people that we should act on right in order of importance, and then you could expect it over a matter of quarters.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
You know things will get subsequently addressed and developed.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So I think the maturity of that whole process. And so, Pete, I think that goes back to this.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Everything is a project approach. it's like need maybe expressed as a user story, right like if we were to use the little Pm.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Backbone that you and I spent a couple of hours on like a a user.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:40.000
A A community member has this problem and would like this outcome in a mobile bond, and then that could start to inform everything as a project lion that gets queued up and maybe eventually executed on

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
So that's an so like needs expressed as stories you know.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Reconciled and prioritized

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Okay, So let's go should we roll back to the next feedback in the chat

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Sure I could screen share again. See?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:44.000
See.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Okay, I think we were

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Does that remember the last question we were at I don't know why I can't find it let's see

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000
We did 2 D. and then just a few more right

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Yeah, it just seems like there's something missing here

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Okay. So

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Yeah, I think it's where we are

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So, Jordan, do you think we should have a working group dedicated to needs and offers?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You said i'd like to see a working group tweet them, and a little, and merge into the onboarding process What I meant by that was this gets back to like if there's more of a

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:03.000
steady state marketplace that's being enriched over time, and if we imagine that we're going to from 7 us of us to thousands of us getting on board, I was suggesting that if we get really good at maybe

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000
the questions and the asynchronous side of this and as people step into the community.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
There'd be a way to like build up through the onboarding process.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Maybe this relates to what Pete was talking about. Michael is talking about these layers of context and framework.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Then eventually result, and then being able to feed into the need and and offers marketplace.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
But that might be after so So, just to quickly tie it ties out to like the onboarding conversation.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:43.000
That might be that like after after 4, after 4 or 5 min videos, that kind of create the context in your onboarding process, right?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:56.000
You have the option, If you want to play in the needs and and offers marketplace to watch and reflect on 2 or 3 videos, that kind of outline, what those things are, and why and how they function, and whatever and then and then you're

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:07.000
invited to you know, post into the needs and offers marketplace, And so you've built up like you know It's it's taking you a little investment of time to get on boarded little orientation to what that

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:17.000
is. and then you go on, and there, there's that kind of kind of curriculum based learning is in the can be built into the open impact.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Platform, for instance, so we could set up, you know, a series of little modules, and when you get to the third one, then you get an assignment, or whatever, so we might be able to facilitate some of that so anyway, that was

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:43.000
all just to say that seemed approximately right i'm not sure if, and and I think we should tie the process somehow, how asynchronously into how people get on boarded and matt, or they or that so high.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
hypothesis

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Jordan, that it it provokes the question to me of that I think maybe put the finer point on some stuff that we're already talking about.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The needs the offers the needs marketplace being an integral part, I mean, i'm thinking about what thousands of us, and imagining it, as you know, it's not quite a workplace.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:37.000
But it's like we're we're endeavoring to do something together, and is our offers and needs marketplace trying to be both office bulletin board where we're talking about you know I i've

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:54.000
got a you know. i've got a surfboard to sell I've got, you know. you know, we're having a a street party, you know all all the different things that apply to people in the workplace and are open to others but not really having to do

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:04.000
with the work versus We are putting our offers in needs. out here for the projects that are in service of our higher goal.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And let's let's not let's not sell surf boards here, and and maybe it's both.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000
But I mean, I think that's part of the the lack of clarity, hey?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Guts. very correct lack of clarity and that's good differentiation arising from that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:38.000
So to repeat that back there's these different levels there's there's a community of people trying to do things together, and there's a natural desire to say, Hey, i've got a place to stay or does anybody want to serve forward

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
or i'm posting a native American fluid class on Block.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Right. So those are the things you'd find like on a on a lunch room bulletin board, or on a Starbucks bulletin board like those kind of things.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Then There's Then there's offers I think among the that are like work related, offers among the community of projects moving in service.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.000
The goal like I'm vincent made an offer to mentor and a certain type of tooling somebody's moving in service to the goal.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Let's say so that's a great offer that's kind of open.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Then we had somebody like Judy go Okay, i'm i'm willing to help in these kind of areas.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:32.000
But I I don't I can't get flooded out with requests from like small projects to work on project proposals, because I should probably be working on the higher levels of abstraction.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
So I'm willing to work on project plans but that kind of the Meta project level.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Let's say, and so that's a different than let's say, Vincent's offer on on cut it.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
So. so I think those are like at least 3 levels of differentiated exchange that are important, and that we didn't really t up.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And even the example of vincent's offer which you know sounded oh, like I I can how like learning more about no code, you know, would would help me in doing some project that isn't Meta project related so i'm

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:20.000
interested in that you know, for for the things that are being offered for there to be an understood parenthetical.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:38.000
That's like duties of, like, i'm not our from this to everybody, for anything i'm offering this as part of our collective mission, you know, and and if my skills can benefit your piece of our collective mission and

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Vincent as i'm trying to listen to this from your perspective I think there's that like 2 to whom is the offer made?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Type thing that it's an opportunity to to differentiate that. But I think this goes back to all of us being new and not really understanding that, and I and I think it it takes some like that.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
It wasn't obvious to me and I think it tell you experience and go through with it.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
You haven't dealt with those different abstractions you know.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:14.000
So yeah, I mean part of it is you know this is kind of one of the first times running this where we're trying to kill 2.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Well, maybe we're trying to feed 2 birds with one scone. So right, using the event itself to also feed the community more broadly, with like the offers and needs that we're at the event.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
For people who missed it. So there is definitely more clarification.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
There needed. This is this process is done within large companies.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
So like. I was touching on briefly in Ford.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:59.000
My good friend Dominic was telling me about the process. that they do at the like executive level for across departments, figuring out what are the different needs and how they can be met.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:10.000
There's 2 things that are done that we didn't really do. So one is There's some shared understanding by everyone of like what are the goals of like right?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:21.000
We all know what the goals of the company are, and so when somebody shares a need, then the Second level is having the discernment.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
So the people who are in those meetings have the discernment to say you that's not the need you you?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.000
That's not the right need or like you actually need this and so be cool to have the end.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Goal. And then, when people say this is what I need have a good enough understanding of being able to say, actually, what you really need might be this: you're asking for the wrong thing.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And yeah, that's something that as there is more understanding of the goal or Meta project, and that and it's more clear what the different working groups are, and what is actually needed by the organization as a whole, then you can also have

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
people that are taking these knees and offers and aligning them.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And you know, being a little bit more critical about whether or not it's the right thing.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Yeah, we just just to validate that like in the CEO advisory groups.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I've been been a part of that's a really key thing as someone will present an issue, and and a lot lot lot of the time.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:36.000
If you have 20 sharp people, in the room, the issue will end up being clarified in a pretty different way, and and I guess that's a little bit of maybe what Jonathan and I model that's like you can go

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000
from they, presenting symptom to deeper root causes, and come to a much more comprehensive solution.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
So that that seems like an important point. And and Benson, then I think I think this place to what you were saying to Michael like.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Really, if we strongly can textualize within our overarching shared goals, why we're doing this right, then it forces every kind of need and offer to be heard in the context of what we're trying to accomplish

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:23.000
together. And then, if there's that that ability to kind of shape, So 1 one interesting thought. so, Vincent, you were saying that happens at the team level, basically, or the department level, let's say, instead of at the end individual level, So one

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
of the things cost departments typically I mean it could also happen within a team as well.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Yeah, Yeah. So it's it's a fractal But I think that the example you gave was where internal teams are kind of discussing what their needs are.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Then they're presenting those out across teams right right So So at that level of analysis you're getting a different thing.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Right, You're getting someone who's expressed the need to a team.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Then the teams crosses that enough that they're then presenting it out across teams for so so that's Another just interesting thing is, I guess it relates to we were going back.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
To. Maybe we don't make and keep commitments at the individual level.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000
We try to get individuals into small groups or teams and then and that's the level that we operate at a little bit more.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:23.000
So. I wonder if some of that would help sort it out like trying to figure out I don't know Yes, and

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Okay, we got we've got maybe 12 min here I guess

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Okay, so Jonathan said, transformed to see our needs and offers for reels.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Bill said. I thought the breakout conversations worked well.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I thought the last section expressing was very practical, and point to some possibly valuable conversations to take place soon.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:29.000
The next question was, Was there anything you found transformative, and could have been done better If we run this again, Judy said, smaller, discrete half aspects for easier response and collation

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Pizza. I think we skipped over, grounding in some sort of history of offering these throughout human history, and how?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Why we might want it offers a needs market for our community

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I mentioned allowing people to submit things beforehand, and be able to spend more time in person discussing and clarifying.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:08.000
So if you have the reflection, time of writing down your offer, then you can use that time to for people to be like.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Is that actually the right need or the right offer? Johnson said.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
The kind of need slash offers needs tweaking.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Most people show service. So yeah, that was specifically in the fields.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Better communication about onboarding to the event. page. If you use again, it seems to me that expressing needs first provoked a very different and empathetic response maybe need should go first

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
I'll stop there there's 2 more but does anyone want to saw some things in the chat.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
I could keep sharing this since I went through a few of them.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Do they want to comment, and any of the things that we're just mentioned.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I think it's an interesting idea to set up a workflow in which maybe there's some asynchronous videos that lead, or something that we need to well expressed offers and needs and then using the time together

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:38.000
to. So I think that's what you were saying then sent to facilitate some kind of a process that to understanding an expression in advance, and then uses the time together to kind of like that and centerize and clarify

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:46.000
that feels like that could be that could be really useful in in companies a lot of times.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:58.000
If a offer needs gonna be presented to like processing permission to requires some work ahead of time, you know, to kind of fill out the form properly contextualize the issue and make sure.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
So it's really really efficient uptake for the group instead of people kind of processing live in group settings.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
That's an interesting idea

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I also wonder, as a look at the the notion of thinking about things beforehand, and submitting things beforehand.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:30.000
And I think back a little bit to one early tapestry grid where, you know, we were sort of saying, Well, these are things.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:44.000
It was. It was very, very broadly defined in the sense that okay, here are some things that i'm good at

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:59.000
That That's the piece of the tapestry form I remember, but but also thinking about like how one experiences a a job hunt, for instance, and looking at a a site where or you know.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Look on linkedin and seeing. Okay, this is who somebody is and what they offer that doesn't specifically mean that that what they describe is exactly the only thing that they could do.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:37.000
And if you can, if you can, more generally both describe your skills and your needs, it may be that you're willing to volunteer some, and you're willing to be paid, do some stuff for money, and you're willing to do some stuff

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:49.000
for Bart, or and it you know if somebody wants to work with you on X, and wants to do it for barter, and they've got something you want that's cool.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
But it doesn't mean you're only willing to work on X.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:07.000
For barter, and and if you do that thing for barter they you wouldn't you know it's it they're all they all get mixed up at times i'm i'm not presenting answer right

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:19.000
there. But I do think that the doing something in advance where you kind of generally flesh out what you've got to offer, and what you need it.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:29.000
It's This might be a little helpful compared to like, Okay, here is a block of a thing that I am willing to do.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:40.000
And response to it. This is really interesting. doing something in advance to kind of flush out, you know.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Kind of who you are. and what you're passionate about and what you'd like to be doing, You know almost in what percentage is, and what you need.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000
That's really interesting. Michael, the the thing that that's making me think of is that people have no idea what they like really.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And and so I think there's like if you're forming a team.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
You're like, Okay, Michael, what's your best role in the team.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:27.000
It's like well I don't know and it depends on everybody else in the room, and what we all like doing, and whatever, and so it's almost like, I I guess what what I think you're presenting is that if there's a process

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:42.000
that kind of gets to know each person we can kind of help each other, find out how we fit, and where and how that meets the total set of volunteering, and 8 h that come together to create and and maybe that's super unfair to

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:56.000
expect that someone would be able to articulate that for themselves right So i'm almost thinking, jonathan you you advocated, for you know when someone's coming in kind of this. I don't know what

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:08.000
It's called but a Mentor guardian role. that kinda I a a greeter Yeah. then a mentor guardian who kind of Yep.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.000
If it box you do a process so getting to know you, introducing you to different circles, you might play in like finding out what you want.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Someone someone might want full time paid work, and someone might want 40 h.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
A paid work, and would love to spend 15 h on coding a game.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
They're passionate about this you know as part of the team and someone else.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
They just wanna volunteer for an hour a week, you know.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
So I think the way to help out who people are, What they want to do and plug them in is is really critical.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
The the other type of persona that that makes me think of is like I bet between us.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000
At least I know I have a decent network of people who would like for sure take a 15 or 30 min action if I ask them to.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Right. Well, we'll not engage to try to figure out what to do. so that's like a whole other persona right where there's almost like a push like a I was in a board meeting the other day for a different organization and one.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Of the board members, said, Man, I just wish we always had a constant stream of just knowing what's needed next for the organization advancing, and like just constantly getting fed information so that we in our network know what's needed to get through

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:39.000
the next roadmap. So that's an interesting side of this to So maybe there's something about defining the different types of personas even that play

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000
It has been suggested that we should have a questionnaire.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:57.000
That is a resource that the people you just talked about could A.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:04.000
In the process of onboarding new people and discovering what their skills and passions are.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:11.000
That questionnaire kind of got bogged down and then died.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I would love to see it provide

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Could revive under your leadership, Jonathan. I accepted

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Okay, so just got a minute here. I think I think this was really useful, because I so I think we got less of like a super tangible next step than we could have, and probably a much deeper understanding of the process

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:01.000
So I feel like this is this is leading us to. I feel like our experiment to Orient like. So I think if we take Pete suggestion that we look at that as an experiment to kind of like practice and run a game, and feel what it was

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000
like that feels like it led us to have a much more differentiated understanding of all this.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:18.000
That could probably then lead us into a next step, being kind of like a process or project type plan of how we advance this.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:30.000
So I That would be kind of my suggestion on where where we want to go next is that maybe we maybe I communicate out to the group like, Okay, that was an amazing experiment.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:41.000
And here's some of the things we learned and based on that what we're gonna do is come up with a problem Good plan for how we're gonna contextualize and set up these markets a little better and advance that

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000
over the coming week Something like that. how How does that hypothesis sound?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
And is there any other key actions we should take this week?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Come to the end of this

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Yeah. then said, yes, that sounds good. and i'd like to set up a 1 h meeting that to go basically a co-working meeting.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
This is something that I would do I could do on my own.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:30.000
But instead, I'd rather just say hey, i'll be working on this at this time, and if anyone wants to join basically could go through Hi, Judy time.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Sorry I came in late. I had another meeting run over no problem.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Much at this point, but yeah we're we're 1 min over.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
So, Vincent, just making closing comment here and then we've Got it recorded.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
I I could hang on for a few more minutes with you.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Gd. So maybe i'll wrap up and then pass it to you in case you had any reflections, and that you want to share with the group.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Live. Okay, I would just saying i'd like to spend about an hour to go through the needs and offers that weren't captured and synthesize and curate those i've started already.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And then basically figure out the right way to export that information.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.000
So it can be sent out in a newsletter, and shared with the broader community.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:36.000
So basically, those seem like the next action steps. And so if anyone here would like to be invited to that meeting, try Okay.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Cool let me know send it out i'll post in matter most as well.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I came in on my phone for convenience so Vincent before that.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000
What's what's ping and just I think I got one or 2 emails from people that didn't have your email address.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
So just make sure I get those forwarded to you before that.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Before that meeting. And then so so Judy just to kind of so to sum this up, basically, we're going in we're going in 2 directions.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:27.000
One is vincent's gonna set up a working meeting to go through the needs and offers that weren't captured anything that came in from email and then figure out how to export and share that so that'll maybe bring some little

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:42.000
notes connection from the experiment we did. and then Judy We were also realizing the need to kind of contextualize the process and project plan a little bit better on rolled out marketplaces.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
And why and kind of reorient, and evolved that over time.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:58.000
So maybe in that. so we'll go towards kind of a longer term strategic plan that leads to how we do this and get better at it over time, and it will make use of what we already captured with a working session

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.000
and communication from then since does that sound good? Yeah, that sounds good.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Okay, you alright, Well, thank you guys so much. This was this was insightful for me.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:20.000
That was really helpful to kind of differentiate out these levels, and I hadn't thought through them like this, and probably couldn't have, without experience experiencing it.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000
So Thanks, Vincent, for hosting, and thank you, everybody, for working to sort this out.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Things valuable awesome. Well, thanks guys, appreciate it we'll see you guys soon.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Alright. great thanks for it. Do you want to hang on for 2 min.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I'd love to hear your let let me let me get zoom up on my tablet, so I can actually see it on better scale.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
I'm just gonna rejoin the meeting from my tablet instead of my phone.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Yeah, Jonathan, you're welcome to hang on if you want

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Once I'm connected on the tablet i'll shut my phone off.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Okay.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Recording. I'm, you did one of you to prevent i'm trying to figure out how to I got a quicker.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Yeah, leave the other one. Then problem should solve itself, I think, Okay, Okay.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Judy, since you're here. I wonder if I could schedule a time to talk with you, you want me to remove the muted Judy from the meeting.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Yeah.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Is that better? Yes, Okay. Good. host removed you. Yes, thank you.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I was having trouble losing my phone to get rid of this and hearing the echoes up here.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000
So I apologize i'm sorry that I didn't get here on time.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I had a number of convention is going on but and I didn't fully capture the recap.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:49.000
If you wouldn't mind kind of doing that very quickly again, then I can offer whatever wisdom I might afford

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Yeah. After this is over we can find your time to schedule a meeting.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Alright, thank you. i'm a little buried right now, cause like between some board meetings .

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Later in the week should be pretty good. Okay, i'll drop and look for you in a direct message.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Yes, okay, perfect. Thank you. Bye, bye, bye.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
No point in keeping someone here for a multiple recap that doesn't need it.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Sorry so so sorry this. but I was trying to triage some stuff that was going on at a national meeting in Chicago and some boarding board activities, and it just all piled on Me no worries

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
and and then my housekeeper showed up it it's just like, Okay, this is.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:46.000
But there's just the world is influx for sure and that's part of what I was trying to address at the National meeting. So American Chemical Society, which I served in for many years.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
But have been relatively, you know, quietly, and committee work the last 5 to 10.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:03.000
But between 2,007 and 2,015 I was in a bunch of different roles there, including chair of the board, and it's a big professional association which I just actually for you to be aware I just

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:14.000
sent Jordan the link to the director of the American Acs American Chemical Society, Green Chemistry Institute,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
There they and the society at large and a broader scale, are fostering a sustainable development.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Community focus for that professional association, and they connect with all the chemical societies worldwide.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So I mean this woman from Washington's working with China right now looking at some stuff in South America, and so forth.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:49.000
This really well with Meta, So I sent the Meta links and Jordan's name and Klaus's name to this Gci person, and then sent her name to both of them phone call no that's awesome

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah, when I was in engineering school. i'm yeah I found out about the like, Bab Zoom, it's institute for green chemistry.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I'm not sure if it's related but I was really interested in the whole like work on green chemistry is critical, and the the call I was on the displayed me from getting to this one on time was with you

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
know I was never in the presidential succession for a variety of reasons.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I didn't have my hip 3 place and I couldn't walk around all the meetings the way the president's needed to do, but when I was on the board and board chair, one of the other acs board members who was highly

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
valuable was a woman named Diane Schmidt, who was with P.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And and she has since retired, and she is also became subsequent to being on the Board President, which is a one year term, which is the member of the governing body for life, and stays connected in additional ways, and she and I were 2 of

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the outspoken women industrial chemists, And so I was on the phone with her about taking sustainable development. and the

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You us nsf Report on State of Science in the Us.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Some of the committees in in dc and to the acs CEO, and that kind of thing, and it just distracted me.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It was like I haven't been in this storm for a little while i'm out of practice.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I did but It's fascinating and I remember with pleasure having, you know, going to Germany to meet with the German chemical people into England to meet with the Uk Society, from the Royal Society, and to Japan, and so

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:38.000
forth, and so it's it's an opportunity that's one of the things I put in that I could leverage for your listing when we had that meeting a few days ago, was the connections to some of these groups

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:53.000
and each of these professional societies has tendrils out to pretty much every university and relevant people because it's the main publication mode for the chemical scientists and i'm on a newsletter from the

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
American Physics Society, which does a great job with Washington events around science better than acs.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Actually it's sort of fyi this week in Washington and it's stuff about science.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So there's just a lot of potential networking but we need to figure out how not to confront or conflict with the existing networking.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That's typically more academically oriented than industrially oriented.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Okay, A Cto. chief technical officer Summit that meets a couple of times a year with invited principles from major, Us.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Corporations, and 3. M. was a member of that as is P.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And G. and a variety of other Duponts big companies.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah. So the that helps push the sustainable development into the industries that have to do all of the changes of the science to be sustainable. I was doing those connections and getting Jordan and

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Klaus connected to this woman from acs because I don't need to be in the in the circuit between them.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Talk to each other and figure out what they might find that they would want to collaborate about.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah, AwesomeSorry to interrupt with all of that recap but it's sort of buzzing around in my head distracting me.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, i've been thinking about it more and more lately in terms of green chemistry.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Just I read an article about rainwater. How?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It was saying that like basically nowhere and earth is greenwater below the safe limit for certain can't like cancer, causing chemicals like the forever chemicals. right remote part of the Earth rainwater is above

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:05.000
the safe limit, which is crazy. Well, it it's because for centuries we use rivers for disposal. we thought they were, you know, essentially safe, and we didn't really understand at the time we were using them the

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:19.000
lifetimes of the materials that were hazardous and we didn't even know, for sure they were hazardous, you know. So it's it's been a an awkward learning curve Yeah, exactly I mean what

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:35.000
we could do if we need to, but it would be massively expensive, is move toward desalination on a much more global scale, which would be a way to bealinate and then detoxify water cause it would take out a bunch of the

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
other stuff, too, you're basically distilling The water out free of the other things which are always higher.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Electricity And if we went to fostering global desolatization of you know, to read that to supplement rainwater which picks up right now all the contaminants in the air So that's that's a big part of

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:09.000
the problem. I don't I don't I'm sorry to go checky on you, my friend Jackie worked on a desalination startup for a while in college.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Well, they're They're significant in some other parts of the world where water really is a shortage.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
They're they're desperately needed and there's some desalination going on in South America.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I Haven't really had had reason to even look at the the state of global desalination efforts.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And they're not energy cheap, either because you basically have to evaporate the water unless you use salt fits.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And then you get contaminated. Salt bits that can't just easily be used without maybe some purification to provide salt to things for anything cause you don't want to keep pumping the bad thing back into the

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:52.000
atmosphere, either in the air or in the runoff from the salt that you put on the roads in the winter, or whatever.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah, it makes a lot harder to handle the byproducts when it makes it does, anyway.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So to recap where you're going with the stuff you did today, You don't have to.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You don't say we have to include this big digression let me let me stop the recording Yeah, You can edit some of that off at the end
