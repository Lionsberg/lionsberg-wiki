WEBVTT

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
feed me. Len: I are also in the process of exploring these kind of processes with other groups like future capital and working group.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So me and I will be co-hosting attempt at something like this.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Tomorrow. it's actually a different part of the process But will lead to some poll planning and those working groups over the next couple of weeks.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So we kind of have different networks of energy merging together with them.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
With some massive potential and we're gonna have to explore all these these different relationships and develop shared maps.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I wanted to try to introduce today a process called poll planning. and when we, when we launch large drawing ventures in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry that are too big for anyone organization to execute on an

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
isolation. We go through this poll planning process, and so you could imagine that lots of different people from lots of different expertise.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Come along could imagine the groups of you. you like electrical experts and the cost, creating structural experts and structural steel experts and earth moving experts and architects and engineers, and all the different specialties and each one comes

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to the table with a with a unique perspective on what needs to be done over a series of years, in order to accomplish the shared goal, and drawing on thousands of years of wisdom and building and construction and combining that with some

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
of the breakthroughs from lean and toyota production system and things like that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The industry arrived at this process of backwards, planning that's kind of rooted in some of the lane practices and and the industry discovered that when you try to try to figure out how you're gonna accomplish something that's let's

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
say, gonna take 5 years and cost a half 1 billion dollars, or whatever to do.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If you start at the beginning, and try to work forward it's very difficult for the human mind to grapple through it, and you kind of end up wandering down a whole bunch of different processes and getting lost conversely we've discovered that if

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you start at the end and really center into the shared intention, and then work your way backwards, descending 3 different levels of abstraction and relatively short amounts of time, you can come to to pretty pretty reasonable

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
milestone based pathways to get to get to the goal.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So again, I don't know if this will work but i'm really grateful for you being here to take the time to kind of roll up our solution.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The last thing, maybe, before we just kind of roll up our sleeves and dive in is

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
People like Hank Cune are working with different groups, and even nations, on figuring out how to create shared visions for their future.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so this this process that we're about to go through starts after a shared vision, has been created, and then really grapples with how to bring that shared vision into reality.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So Hank and I have just had small passing conversations on.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Okay, as we can be in these groups, really center in on what we want the future to look like, Then how do we backcast?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
How do we pull, plan, and then get everybody aligned on a rough series of milestones to bring that into reality?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Time so before, before we dive in let's just roll around the room.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Just do, maybe a quick 1 min check in on How everyone's coming in any particular questions or curiosities.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You have a around the process, but let's just take maybe 60 s each, just for a quick check in how's your How's your heart, and soul?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Any any particular thing that's alive or inquiries around this project, and then we'll we'll dive in, and after about the 10 min that i'll take so let's see just to I guess model that i'm

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
coming, and

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Balanced and full of potential there's so many streams of energy moving.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I feel like so greatful and feeling curious doing emergent i'm just really excited to see how we can we can merge these streams of energy together.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We bounce to you, for example, check in sure.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
My heart is good my soul. Well, I have planted our fashion. i'm right foot so half my soul was not doing so well.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's been pretty painful and really a drag after 2 years of lockdown to be stuck at home, not really being with a walk anywhere, or go out for any like the time. but i'll do what I can to

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
stay buoyant and informed, and getting in on checking on the zoom calls and checking with people.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And i'm really curious to learn more about what's going on here.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I've followed a little bit on the the text streams what's happening, but not a lot.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So i'm really here just at jordan's imitation yesterday, you know. hey? if you want to make it up to this call here, I am happy to see Milo again.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It's been a while, Michael. good to see you Hank as always, Jonathan.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We bet on one of our calls and Vincent, so I know a few folks here and just happy to be here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Forest.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Sure as as well. feeling good energized

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The process sounds very exciting in terms of for me is something to learn in terms of both.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How it's been applied, and the rest so looking forward to that really and pleasure to see and meet you this way can briefly having watch many in the Ogm.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Messages and have that pleasure of reading. and I think, having met almost everybody else looking forward to Hank, get any more chance to connect it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So i'll pass fantastic for us There you go.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Hi, everybody, and nice to meet all of you again? but ken You're in New York.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Can we learn more about you i'm coming in with excitement, because I was seeped in lean 6 sigma and process stuff my whole career?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So i'm curious to see how this all goes personally. I'm. i'm feeling like one of those Chinese artists, you know.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:12.000
They have plates on sticks. I have a lot of plates going right now, but I still wanna be hearing. so.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Thanks so much for making the time. Marianne mila hi

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Just the logistics question jordan I couldn't access the Mirror Board.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I have. we question access. Hi, everyone. I think I know a few of you can love me to see you again.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And Marianne and Forest, and I think we met hank together in another mapping exercise, and hello to everyone else.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I'm very tired i've had very few hours of sleep has been going on so far at the moment that very rapid rate, so I may not be able to stay longer than i'd like to so I have to leave 15 min.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
To be Howard, and then hopefully, I can come back in an hour's time, and over to Johnson.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Thanks for that. This is gonna be great. I I declare it, Moliers, I pass it to

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Alright, thank you. been watching this develop for 4 years. now it's Jordan and i'm looking forward to see the continued evolution development growth create spontaneous creative additions and the determined effort that all combined to make something

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
worse, and the people that i'm i'm i'm enjoying people.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So I come very happy to continue the process of meeting people and on a personal note.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I'm pondering How our involvements are connections are hopes, are dreams, Are history combined to create a sense of call.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The divine inspiration, the human interaction, the inspiration of others.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It all forms the sense of call in our lifetime at a point in my life where that has become important in a different way than it's been in in the younger years.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So I'm excited for that reason too, so let's pass it on to Michael

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Michael may be away. will bounce to hang. Yeah, here?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Apologize I am less than in camera ready.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But i'm gonna come on camera, anyway, just still running around and dealing with some stuff.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But I my my hard disk here my years third year and very excited about my come out of the session and and future sessions, and what's come out of pass sessions so great to see all the I

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I will be here, even when you don't see my face you're looking.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'll pass you look beautiful and camera adding Michael thanks for

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Well, I think I heard my name so let me say something i've been following this project since.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
More or less beginning i'm very excited about what will come out of it.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I'm really like the way we are really expressed the the desire to create the sense of call in our lives.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So I know. towards that question marks and my question mark as well.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I've got a call in my life to be share with others i'll pass where to

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Hey? Everyone I know most of you and nice sooner faces i'm just excited to see what yeah, what this format is, and what we can create together. because I know individually, all the people here are pretty incredible.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So hopefully that there's an exponential what we do together for us.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Did you go yet? Thank you, Vincent. Oh, my missing, is it?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I think

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I think I think we hit it. Anybody left out. Okay. uniform, all right.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Well, shall we dive let's let's develop a couple rules here.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I'm gonna have So we have a few different things going here, and we have the chat.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We have a Hack Md. up and We have a mirror board up hack. Md.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Let's just do collaborative note taking the mirror board, and let us do mirroring, and the chat will let us do chatting and i'm not going to be able to watch all those

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:04.000
simultaneously. So Jonathan, may I request your your help? and tending to the hack ndy and and just kind of doing some collaborative note taking through this Yup Okay, fantastic?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And then I see a few people in the mayor in the mirror.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Can Marianne etc. i'm sorry I just invite help and collaboration.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
On i'm kind of filling out the marrow as we go.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It'll it'll be I think fairly intuitive so feel free to to kind of help and collaborate in the mirror will go live, and then would anybody like to volunteer to kind of help help watch the

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:41.000
chat, and just bring into the conversation at the right time anything that gets spoken out that that can need to enter the room

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Sure. Okay, Okay, yeah let's have yeah Marianne.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Why don't You use your intuition just to kind of keep an eye on the chat, and if you see anything that doesn't get spoken?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Just speak it out at the right time. beautiful Okay, great so I'm gonna try to balance explaining the process to a great enough a degree.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Let me share my screen. Here.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Okay, Great: Alright. So this is this is basic goal planning board.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And explain that how the how the process worked like I mentioned things in lean 6 sigma toy to quick production system, etc., rooted in this concept of poll systems as opposed to push systems on the the beauty

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
of whole systems, as they align with with lean philosophy.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And when when this check technology usually hits industries it usually discovers 60, 70, 80% waste. i'm.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, for instance, the industry I came from construction when they started analyzing it through this lens.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000
They were looking at, you know, somewhere between 60 and 70% labor waste overall on an industry wide standard.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000
That's that's pretty common and my announcement and many other people smarter than us.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We might think that the human industry kind of the human system on planet Earth is also something like an 80 or 90% waste industry where the vast amount of activity that we're engaged in isn't actually producing you know throughput of what we

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:51.000
want. So this system works by attempting to align everybody on kind of the overarching vision and goal which will, which we'll start with up here on this large postit Note i'm gonna just pull in a quick proxy for

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that that might be good enough for us to start with for the sake of time.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And then you'll see over here on the left side of these board these descending elevations, 50,000. 30,000.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So those are basically meant as elevations or levels of abstraction.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And so you could imagine that if we're flying in an airplane over a field at 50,000 feet.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You see only kind of significant details, major cost geographic features.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And so it's just a very high level overview, and then you can imagine that if we drop down to 30,000 feet, the detail would start to fill itself in you'd see a little bit more drop down to 10,000 feet and then all the way

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:51.000
down at ground level you're you're right stuck in the weeds. right, and you can't see what you can see at 50,000 feet, and your surround is by an endless array of detail.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So, of course, the whole planning process works by centering out to the the furthest distant vision or goal, and then working backwards at each level of abstraction and starting to fill in those various levels of resolution and

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000
we'll we'll dive in just to the practice of it But what we're gonna do is we're gonna we'll spend maybe let's say 10 min or so just centering out on division, and tension

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
goal. we'll start at the 50,000 foot level and go okay.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:41.000
If we were to. if we were to work in reverse and pick like 5 major miles stones that mark the way to the goal of the kind of world we want to live in what might those be and you'll get these big kind of

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
salient features of work, and then what you do is you then drop down to 30,000 feet, and we can zoom in right.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So if we had at this top level 5 levels, we could then zoom in to these 2 and go okay.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And if we were to fill in and reverse 5 different features of work just between these 2, what would those be right?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:15.000
See you then start focusing in on these blocks so after a couple after a couple levels, you'd have 5 with 5 build in between those and you'd have an approximate app of 25 milestones to get there.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
If you then drop down to another level of analysis this and started filling those in you'd end up with the same thing.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000
So what you end up with is a more and more granular milestone based path, marking the way towards the goal.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Does that

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Does that kind of broadly make sense? And are there any questions?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
As I pause before we go into the next step Marianne. No, i'm good. that makes sense.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So everybody roughly tracking with the logic of how this works. And can you use the links again?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I can

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Hi, Pete, Hey, Jordan, hey? All I can do it to Jordan.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I can schedule That'd. be great thanks and if you could grab the hack.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Md. Link as well, Jonathan, or very end up with great Just drop that one in.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Okay, beautiful. Okay. So I So everybody's got kind of the rough rough intuition for how this works, and and just to spend we I did a brief intro, but to to take 2 min just to visualize this with something that we could

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:46.000
imagine the kind of the kind of flow that we'll get into is the idea of Okay, if our if our intention is a house that's a suitable dwelling place for our family to flourish and we were to back

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
plan that right? We might say that the last with 5 major milestones, we might say that the last thing we did was place kind of the final furnitures and fixtures.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
It might say that before that we could place the furnitures and fixtures, we probably had a roof on it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000
We might say that before we could put the roof on we had to have some something to put the roof on, so we had to build the walls before, that and what did we need before the walls were before we could put

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
walls up. We needed a foundation, and what did we need before?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
The foundation. Well, before the foundation could go, we had to, you know, repair the earth, and make sure it was stable.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And so then when you look at that and and forward you go.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Okay, Well, to build a house. We need to stay stabilized the earth, Then build the foundation, then build the walls, then put the roof on, then put everything inside the house right, and it's just a very simple.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:48.000
5 miles stone way to build a house, and then you start ding into deeper and deeper levels of granularity over to forest.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Sure, thank you, and thank you, so I guess mine is jumping up.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I see you have the intention listed as work site earth, and if that's the And so I guess my first question is that the intention that these first 5 posters are about and then the question that kind of goes with that in

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:31.000
terms of clarification is, if I was thinking about work, site, earth, and humanity, and all that on it, then I start thinking about things like energy and water and food, and that seems to be a little but different than a house in terms of

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:39.000
tangibility. And so I just was seeking clarification about that.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Yeah, great. So so we'll go there next and I think it'll make sense.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
But it. But if you were to develop a house in which you're family could flourish.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:54.000
You'd have to include in there water you have to include in their energy, and you'd have to include food in there right.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And so those those things, all that's kind of the beauty about this holistic view is it forces you to go. okay?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Well, we got this beautiful house constructed and we didn't pay attention to the water and the sanitation we're not going to flourish there so so very much Your intuition is right on track that every single thing required

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
to flourish. We will need to address in this plan, which gets which gets difficult.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000
But so okay, so. So I I corrected that statement to say what's our intention for work site, or and i'm gonna take a little short.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Okay, here, i'm gonna say I think i've talked enough with the people.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:47.000
On this call to say that, you know if our intention is something like love we want for all the inhabitants of worksite earth to flourish, and that requires a whole set of things to happen right and instead of spending too, much time

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
on that today. i'm going to start with a rough crock see? that's already had you know billions of dollars of work and time.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Go into it and have been agreed on by a 100 and 93 Nations and that's that's the Us.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Sdgs and i'm not saying these are the right ontology. but i'm just saying they've been agreed on by a vast swath of humanity. so i'm just gonna kind of read these out right and

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000
So if if we're creating our intention 108, 80, 93 nations have said something like you know, we want no poverty.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
We want no hunger, we want health and well-being.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Would wine, quality, education. We want gender equality, like cleaning, water and sanitation.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We want affordable and clean energy so this is sorry good that for us.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:55.000
We've already hit your at your nodes we want meaningful work and growth.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:21.000
We'll have to find what that means industry, innovation, and infrastructure done in a way that helps and not harms reduced inequality, sustainable slash, regenerative cities and community please responsible

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
consumption and production

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Regenerative living system, slash climate, let's say flourishing life below water, flourishing life on land, piece justice, strong institutions and partnerships and cooperation

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:06.000
To bring this into reality. Okay. So so this you can kind of reflect on this any way we want.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:22.000
But let's talk about maybe there's also some things here like like no corruption and injustice whatever.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
So we can kind of go through this but I but it's just an intuition.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So what is there anything substantially that's missing here?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Let's just take 5 min and and kind of center in when we, when we reflect on something like this what's flowing from the heart of love, the elimination of the things that cause unnecessary suffering and

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:54.000
injustice and the establishment of the things that are needed for flourishing life in any community, so anything any signature, gaps or flaws.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And kind of the intention that we're setting here Marianne.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Yeah, it feels like i mean you've kind of said it. but I don't know if we should emphasize it.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So no dominion over nature, no extraction. no exploitation, no extinction, no colonization like I don't know if you need to emphasize that.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
But we are so into going that way. the way the system is set up now, so I don't know my thoughts. Yeah, So let's say no extraction exploitation.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Human system, realigned and re integrated with living system.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Something like that. Is that kind of cover that concerned Marianne.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Okay, wendy What turns up? having written a paper around one of them.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Poverty and a state in the Us. What turns up when your tasks to do with one properly, and you let people talk enough.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
The other ones just turn up, anyway. So once you just start on one, the others almost always turn up.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Well, once you've got the thing is if you try and do all of them at once. It doesn't work you actually have to start with one and let them sort of go out and join them up.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And that was what I ended up having to do i'm thinking This is nothing about the environment.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:20.000
But I looked in there, and there were those stories about cars and houses, and all sorts of things that were unnoticed, starting points for other aspects of the problem.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So you can have confidence that you start with one that's meaningful, and the others turn up is my point.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:39.000
As well. so it's how you approach it not not expecting trying to do all at once, because that just doesn't work You start with one, and they notice the others and get them as spinning plates around the initial

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
one.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Forest. Yeah. actually building directly on what wendy was just saying, i'm wondering if there isn't something that is kind of over arching over the top of this which is essentially a systems view of life and basically what the systems view of life

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000
means is the systems thinking portion is that we're focused on relationships.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Text and the patterns and then in terms of what the intrinsic nature of life is that life is constantly creating and maintaining communities.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:52.000
It's inherently intelligent it's inherently creative. And it's inherently regenerative, and that basically within that 20 or 30 words you actually have an overarching thing that that validates

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000
what Wendy was just saying, which is sense. Every thing is in interdependent and interconnected, depending on where you start, you can get to anywhere.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
But this framework. Okay, great. So so yeah, we can.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:22.000
We can incorporate that by saying something like a heart of love would want the systems view human system reintegrated in the living system within apparently right related and regenerative overall overall.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Elemental. So I think we're we're aligned there.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Yeah. So also building on Wendy and Forest. this the overarching title for me is redesigning a meaningful life, because so that's life to forest this point.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
But I also would like to invite us to consider how we phrase this.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
I know the un's sdg talks about no hunger.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You know how about making that internality rather than problem solving for hunger?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
So in this case it would be what if every single person what's fed?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
What if every single person had well-being instead of fixing her?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Okay. It was a completely different shift in perspective than it allows vast creativity in in how to achieve that

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Thanks for that. Yeah. So we could start to refrain those that's really helpful.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:45.000
So we could say, you know what, if every person was fed had well being had the opportunity to develop into the port of their potential and flourish was equal before society and law.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Bye out abundant access to clean water and sanitation energy.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Just to add to that Jordan basically coming from the systems view of abundance rather than scarcity. Yes, exactly.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Okay, So I I I agree. And I think there was lots of hands going up of reframing this in terms of potentially potentiality as opposed to problem solving

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So the 2 2 ways to to get up. But thank you, Mike.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Bill, and then Wendy

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Okay, thanks. So as i'm cause I look at the goals, you know, we could say Yes, we embrace the overarching let's do everything.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And they're very good goals right but I think What for us is return referred to what Mila kind of stated is that not only can we reframe the in positive terms, but I think we have to look at the

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Cytoquon nod of the goals if people don't work together in partnership and combine their efforts.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
None of this can happen. So it seems to me that Number 19, or whatever is down on the bottom.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Here there was a partnership for the goals I saw in.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
You see that in the Wikipedia list, too?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
The bottom. One is partnership for the goal if we don't develop a mechanism.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:51.000
2 partner and bring him the human intelligence and creativity. and what forest is talking about, and the positive outlook that meal is referring to, and what we would all start talking about.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
We would be talking about things that are needed in a combined effort.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:10.000
So kind of rolling into it. Lionsburg has been built to be, and that is, an aggregating of human creativity without individual ownership.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Of that stewardship owned product to actually make that community effort, a reality that seems to me a very reachable goal in what we're doing even here today.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:35.000
In this exercise. Thanks, Bill. Okay, Wendy

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Yeah. I think everything I wanted to say is already has just been said.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
So I just wanna put an approximation point on neil's share about reframing things positively.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:03.000
There's just so much behind that in terms of how we then ask questions, and what kind of problems we're trying to solve. and it just right from the beginning frames things in a way that sets us on a different path of thinking

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000
and problem solving. So I really appreciate that. she threw that in there, and I just wanted to make sure we we hold on to it tightly.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:19.000
It it really will it's like setting the golf ball on the tea, and hitting it slightly differently in the long term.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
It's gonna have a huge effect. so thanks neil for that Jordan I just want to add what what can hold with it.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
To care for the children of all species but all time maybe that'll cover.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I'm gonna yeah, I said, all generations of life if there yeah, all species or all time.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Okay, great. So So that was great. So we just, you know, we just did 2 decades worth of work, and in 20 min, right? And so we we have this preframing of general understanding of the problems in these inherent in any

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:04.000
of community of life. Bill brought in that we need unified and incorporated quite of action towards Milas redesigning, meaningful and abundant life for all Theelia to be live but to do that sorry

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:14.000
that's rooted in love for all. generations of life for all species in all time, through a systems view that reintegrates the human system with the living system.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
And Harrison as part of that is right relationship and regeneration across time and space.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:33.000
And then we can frame our what if that I won't I won't maybe take time to do them all right here about what, if every person was better, everybody presented that well-being every person had the opportunity to develop into

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
the fullness of their potential and flourish. What if the water was cleaning?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:45.000
What if the land was plain? What if we, if every community of life had what it needed to advance towards its potential and flourish?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Okay, So so we can. We can finish converting this.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:02.000
But how is everybody feeling like, However, you wanna phrase it, but spiritually, energetically like, Is there? reasonably strong field being held here. Bill. Hello, welcome!

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Nice to see you sorry to be late, and I apologize in advance.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:13.000
We have to leave top of the hour. I would invite us not to have any negative phrase in in this thing.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
So the no corruption and no extraction.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Just take those out that affirm those in the positive don't state the negatives.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Yeah, Thank you. resting the positive, beautiful love it. Thank you.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Well restate is positive. we're just take them out because there's the the the whole mood of everything else is very different than that.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:48.000
That's all just transparent and accountable organizations and institutions.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Something like that, maybe. What could I ask a question? And maybe you said this before I got here?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:04.000
There are 2 ways to do this kind of thing. One is very, very high level, Mega statement that encompasses everything, and the other is the laundry list of everything that we care about.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:18.000
And I think the second way is risky I agree gill What's your what's your w We took a stab towards some of these high level statements? But you you made one in one of our other meetings?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Do you want to throw out here? Well, i've got i've got 2 one that I posted in the chat is what if we acted as though we actually belong to the living world and each other that's up in the chat about half a

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.000
dozen up, and the other is a spin on buckies 100%. Give me a minute, and i'll find that this month.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000
What we've got here make the world make the world work for 100% of humanity and the shortest possible time.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
3 spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or disadvantages of anyone.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Yeah, and the and the variation would be hang. Let me get it back up in front of my face.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Here. is to not say a 100%. humanity.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Say, 100% of humanity and all the beings with whom we share the living world.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Beautiful, which makes it long, but gets it what we're all say here, Great. Yeah.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Okay, So I So I think we're I think we're all aligned on this.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Does anybody feel out of alignment with this so we're?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We can restate all these positive we can we can work on our statements, but I think the the spirit and values that are being reflected. we're fairly aligned on. is there?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Is there any significant objections to now advancing towards how we start to pull this into reality?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Wendy. So what i'm thinking at the moment is that for growth is tension and change.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
So there's something here and I don't know how we bring it in about.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So process of negotiating and holding all the differences that is part of well-being, and it's not a cake book.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
So that's that is nature. Now has always you know things are going in.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Things are decaying, and and what looks like it's sometimes wrong with sometimes just the nature of nature.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And I I just hold that lightly I don't know how that appears that I want it to be negative.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:31.000
But you know we do get. tsunamis we do get all sorts of things that that the world tries at us, and not every species last forever.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
And there's something there about the tension from a well-being point of view is just holding this.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:49.000
I guess March of life, and what it turns up to be over time in a way that's rich and not disabling, and it's not something you could easily put in there.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
But i'm just saying that it's not something that we should forget, because it's not all what you call a bed of roses.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So is life and death and all of that. Yeah. great thanks.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Out of how things are. I started a note for general notes up here and just just captured that. So there's a process on that.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
This Okay? great. So time. So i'm going to return to a very simple concrete example that's different.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:31.000
But of a house. right? So So what we've just done is we've designed a a house for our family of humanity, and all being on earth to share in which we have all these positive statements of the basic things that we know

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
are required for life to flourish right we've we've centered into that that reality.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Okay, So and when we're trying to transform a space we have this notion of where we are or the current present state, and then the better and higher future state that we're transforming to right So when we just articulated that world

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:08.000
in which What if every person was fed and had well-being, and had the opportunity to develop into their potential and flourish and blah blah blah, Then if we were to analyze the current forces and conditions and realities, on

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.000
work site, or then look square into the most brutal ones of those we would see that there's a massive gap, right?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000
That's not our current reality and so that sets up this chasm that's present in any of these human endeavors where we have to then grapple.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:35.000
With. Okay, how are we going to transform this work site Earth from what it currently is towards this better, best and highest shared potential?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Okay, And then I think I want to honor gill statement by also saying that if we're going towards the best and highest intention and greatest good that we can articulate it's important not to make that too specific or it

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
gets dangerous because we're kind of concertizing the absolute So but we've created this field.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Okay, So is everybody comfortable starting to, go into seeing if we can learn how to do a little bit of an uncomfortable process together.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000
There's no objections i'm gonna i'm in advance.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Okay, great. I want to highlight attention here which is There's going to be 2 types of thinkers in the room.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I'm some thinkers are gonna want to hold this highest intention and figure out how it how it all lows other people are going to be feeling stressed because it's too big and abstract and they're gonna

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:43.000
wanna pick one element like hunger or making sure everybody has enough food or making sure of it as well being, and dive into that.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:55.000
So i'm gonna ask anybody who's kind of working on the bottom up basis, or wanting to dive into a specific thing just to kind of kind of hold that But let us just start at these highest levels and and to send down

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:08.000
and and see what happens. i'm gonna also follow intuition here and take a little risk.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
So, Milan, I can start practicing for our future capital session tomorrow.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And so if we were to define some of the key like roles or actors, or key different personas that will be impacted by this transition.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:44.000
So we're transforming the entirety of earth from what it is to something else, and we were to start to look at some of these key roles or different personas that might be involved.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:53.000
And i'm thinking things like government might be a persona business might be a persona.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Individuals might be a persona, you know. plants and animals might be a persona.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000
What what other quick personas could we populate that We will want to look through their eyes to see this process with deal?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
How many do you want, Jordan? cause we could do thousands?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Yeah, i'm thinking 10 big ones. Okay, just just the big buckets just to capture the lens.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Civil society, academics, water families and cities, air, soil.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Food.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:12.000
That's 10 anything big where we're missing here maybe cities for communities.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
This is something about the level of I I say granularity.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:25.000
You've got to be and like a little country town is a community for collections of community.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I was. I was recently looking at the map that had mounted 4.5 million basic communities under where people families.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Maybe there's you know there's a 1 billion families 4.5 million communities, fair water soil.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
I'm gonna i'm gonna add one more that's that's a little bit related, i'm a through microbiome on there.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:55.000
That's it. would the energy fall into one of those

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
I think I think we should add it for us.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Thank you, I think infrastructure yeah That's a good one, Jonathan.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I like that. Okay, Yeah. So we could, we could go in. We can go into depth.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And and but we're we're just we're just planning here.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Okay, So i'm gonna invite i'm gonna invite some people to embody these different sections.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:38.000
If you're willing to i'm down to she to look at. So as we're engaging in this process, i'm going to go back to a very concrete building analogy, if we're if we're doing

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
this, and we're going to build the reservoir and we look at the people in the room.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Some of them are are electrical experts or instrumentation experts or structural experts or engineering experts or environmental experts.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And so when you're in this room, you have this diversity of viewpoints, Okay, I'm gonna interrupt myself to big knowledge. V.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Since that's that's called this past and future generations great Vincent.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Okay, So you have this diversity of viewpoints, right?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And something kind of really interesting happens from that. And Neil and Keelu were singing me about about that this week.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:29.000
So. Wendy, would you like to make a quick comment yeah, I'm just thinking of this in terms of if I say complexity systems.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:41.000
That there's sort of 2 lenses here. we either look at all the objects at the end, or you just look for the interactions, and in the end the simpler path is to look for the interactions.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So because this all becomes not a no machine, it becomes very organic, and everything interacts after a while.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
But there's different types of interactions so there's sort of like a people to living other living beans interest.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:06.000
If you like, 100%. Yeah, And what happens? is if you you look for the objects at the end, What happens is you end up saying, Well, what sort of government is that government?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And then there's a 1 billion types and what sort of individuals individual, and it's, you know, a 1 billion, you know, top you end up getting really messy.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
So i'm trying to put us I guess save us some pain from complex systems point of view.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Quite often you can simplify the types of interactions like, you know, human to other non-human thing.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Living thing that makes sense and then you don't actually have to you end up not having to specify all the objects at the other. end, and and I know it's a flea.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:52.000
But he it's worth thinking about yeah thank you yeah so so there's okay.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
This is an experiment right? we're gonna see how it goes and we're learning the limitations of our ability to think together.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:14.000
So completely respect these differences. I completely respect that everything is, and we could look at it from a just pure energy perspective. i'm i'm trying to merge in streams of thought from building from intuitive systems

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
from constellations work just to kind of see if we can replicate something.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.000
So let's go down the path. a little bit and we'll learn from it, and we'll do better next time, because we'll have lots of these to do Okay, so.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:38.000
So drawing on constellations work and different things that that Mila and Kelu have been advocating for i'm gonna ask a few people to What Which of these?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Which of these key voices are critical voices? Our lenses are really critical, that we have someone looking for most of them.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:02.000
And is anybody feeling let's get some names on here So we could all try to look through all these lenses simultaneously, but it's difficult to do so if we assign people to look or representing the voice

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
or the spirit of these different things, we we might have something interesting unfold.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
So if you guys are okay, i'd like to i'd like to practice that.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:23.000
So is anybody feeling called or feeling like They could see through or speak from any of these particular lenses over the next. it's like occupying a persona in a game.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Jonathan simple society. Okay, So okay, so Jonathan would like to. It's good Jonathan, you're gonna just over the next period.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:49.000
You're gonna try to really embody that intuition for what that is, and how it relates to things. And and in that relational way that Wendy was just looking at kind of take that months, anybody else feeling capable of looking

00:50:49.000 --> 00:51:00.000
through these lenses, or representing i'm happy to be air, water, soil, Maybe even the microbiome

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:10.000
We could they're different. but microbiome and microbiome are very closely related.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Actually. Thanks. Good. So ken from that lens, are you perspective?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Are you? Okay with Marianne, representing both of those.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Okay. Great thanks, Marianne. Who else has the ones to look through I'm Happy to represent families

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:44.000
I'll take past and future generations that was Wendy. yeah.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Sorry about that. was that Hank that said ken okay and age great.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Thanks again, Jordan? This is kilo, Why didn't you assign me somewhere Keelu, Why don't you take energy

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Joran i'll take business I was gonna that's Okay, that's the i'm trying to figure out where I fit.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:19.000
So, junior. would you do, Judy? Would you be willing to take government and institutions?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I will have a lot more experience with institutions than government.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
But sure. yeah, that's why I think you're experiencing large institutions.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
But but you to look up through that lines it it's probably better actually than you know.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000
I was not a business person per say, I was a technical person in big business, so that's probably it's probably a better fit.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Great thanks. What do you mean by academy yeah .

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Because because there's a port there's a part of me that sort of in touch with some of those professional association communities.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:11.000
But they yeah, I could universities. yeah okay wendy i'm thinking kind of the totality of university's research

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Vincent will do the atom Okay. great Then since then, since rolling with infrastructure.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Okay, What's very interesting is individuals and plants and animals are still on the table.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I'll go for individuals who who is that that just that's Michael.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You just put Thanks, Michael, you can hear you're perfect for that

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Who would like to? represent plants and animals

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Okay, I will. I will speak on behalf of clients and animals.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Then, Okay, cool. So everybody kind of got their assignments.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Okay, So let's take so much of food maybe for us, forest in Communitiesalright, Pete, would you mind putting your systems to mind to communities.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
No.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.000
No is then you refuse or know you wouldn't mind no I don't mind.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Okay, so let's take let's take a couple of minutes of of silence.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Here. we're about to get into looking at a a very complex system that is, none of these parts.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:17.000
That is only the whole. and yet we can see all these different parts, and so let's let's take a minute of and kind of meditation.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:29.000
How much try to slip ourselves into these roles and anybody who's listening that doesn't have a rule just you, and look from the whole.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Do you mind maybe giving us Jordan What?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
The next question, or task or frame will be so that I can.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
I can start to bring that in. Yeah, So what the what?

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:57.000
The next task is for us, to be is gonna be to dive into this pull planning process, where we're trying to discern how the system transformed, and because it's a total interrelated thing we're gonna do that

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
through seeing what happens if we each look at it through these different lenses.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
So we're going to dive into the pull planning next, and so what what?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I'm hoping we can do here in the next couple of minutes?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Is everybody kind of lay down your own persona and if so i'm representing plants and animals.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:33.000
So over the next 2 min i'm gonna try to slip myself into the persona or spirit, or lens that can speak on behalf of plants and animals, and feel and experience the world from that lens and holiday

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
relates everything. So i'm going to try to be thinking about

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:47.000
How I feel relative to Michael, who's representing business individuals or bill, who's representing business, but from the standpoint or spirit of plants and animals.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:59.000
So let's take 2 min. of silence here just kind of try to feel into that perspective or lends that you're gonna look through for the next hour.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:29.000
So

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
It's kind of the classic walking in someone else's shoes, Metaphor.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000
What does it feel like? How do you empathize? How do you view the world through that?

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Yeah.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Compassion and love over, who wants to flourish on someone who wants others to flourish

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Alright.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Okay, beautiful. So just an hour to kind of introduce the process, to align on the shared vision and intention for our future.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:26.000
That, I think is as everybody as is wanting to move towards.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:34.000
And then we we invited ourselves to think through the different related things that are present in that full.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:49.000
And now we're gonna drop into a working session when we're we're gonna try to think through from all those different conference of perspectives and relationships how the system transforms

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:58.000
I got a suggestion from someone in the chat that before we do that we take another couple of minutes here.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And write down from the perspective of the persona You're representing 5 to 10 primary needs of the group you're representing.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:24.000
That would need to be met more fulfilled in order for that vision or attention that we share to manifest itself.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So this is gonna write from the perspective of business if we're gonna end up in this completely generated and realigned human system.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What are 5 to 10 key needs that would need to be met.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I have a organizational question on that if we're all creating lots of post-its.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But we're coming from the direction should we have a identifier that we use like a number or something.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Yeah, let's do that, thanks for that clarification let's just do that as notes to ourselves.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Let's not do that on the mirror board right now, Does that answer that for us?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Let's just do that offline so I do I think we want.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I don't think we wanna necessarily make that visible what are 5, 10 key key needs

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000
How's everybody doing this? Anybody need I can and I saw you trained it to talk about your own.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You did, sir. Sorry i'm writing in a different window Yeah, I just needed a minute.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Thanks. Yeah, Let's take a couple more minutes

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Okay, how's everybody doing

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Can, Boris. How are you doing good? Okay.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Alright great. Okay. So now now we've each got our we've each got kind of our lenses that we're looking through

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:59.000
We're gonna start at this 50,000 but level and so what we're thinking of is what we're envisioning this transformation from where we press recently are you in 2022 and we're

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:10.000
fixing a time sometime out in the future alright or would you like to vision that 1020 years out where we're living in this different world.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And again we're gonna we're gonna think backwards and try to envision.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Okay? What? What was one of the last things that happened before that flourishing and abundant world in which every being had the opportunity to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:48.000
What happened right before that, and then happened before that and what happened before that we're just gonna try to backcast 5 big, significant milestones that mark the major, the major milestones along.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Those, and see if we can get anywhere anywhere near an agreement on what some of those might have been.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So before we go into to that. let's take let's. just take another minute of silence, or so here. try to walk out to the future, and then just try to in your in your mind backcast, and see if you can see you know

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:20.000
5 major milestones that we could celebrate. that would have marked the transformation between where we are and where we got to.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Those can be as big, as audacious, as impossible as they need to be.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Whatever needs to happen in order for us to get there. Jordan, I have a clarifying question, and that and that is, how do you see?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Taking exponential change into effect because if we're talking about the whole planet.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:59.000
The whole planet won't change in the light switch it'll actually have places that have already got the wholeness that's expanding.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
How do you? Where, where, how do? we friend that gotta just use your intuition Forest.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So. So you've got a so I I understand so I guess how I would just respond to that quickly was maybe milestone.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000
2 out of 5 was that we had a certain number of prototypes or pockets of coherence that we're living it out that the world could see.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And then maybe there was some expansion of those pockets of coherence.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So that might be one way to think about how the system transformed.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And in response to another back channel message I just wanna say i'm on these 5 milestone, we're not gonna try to represent each of the different viewpoints here.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
We're gonna just try to get 5 big ships right just like on a dam.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I'm just gonna use a dam or a reservoir as an example.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:59.000
What these things would look like, as we would say okay first we'd mobilized and assigned all the crews and contractors and teams.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:11.000
There is maybe, a second milestone where we had reshaped the earth and cleaned out the entire foundation that the dam was going to be built on, and we would know What is that?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Maybe the third milestone is that all the earth was filled in?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That was another milestone we can see. maybe the fourth one. Was that all the electrical and instrumentation was completed, and then we filled the reservoir and said they're just the big overarching features of work

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
so looking at it from the overall perspective okay so let's just try this again.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I don't know if this is gonna work. But let's try it and see where we get okay.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:52.000
So what what happened? What was one of the last, like significant breakthrough, visible milestones before this high, higher intention been manifest. But was one of the what happened right before?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:15.000
That does anybody have any have any thoughts or ideas and Let's just be creative and brainstorm, and then we'll merge that we learn to listen because you can use that for you know, listening to Nature listing to our

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:22.000
bodies. Okay, and some'm gonna wow that's an incredibly large buster.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It's you It goes across lots of types of transformation.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You listen to the rocks, you know. Okay, great so so wendy i'm going to honored that by putting

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Oh, seminary, did it, Great thank you for whoever's working with me on that? that's super helpful wendy.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So wendy alfred i'm gonna ask you

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So We're starting at the back Then coming do you think that would happen like right at the end, before this intention came to reality.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And i'm thinking when I see wendy i'm kind of moving it way this way, i'm thinking maybe that needs to happen really soon in order for another bunch of other things to be possible would you agree with that Yeah, I I

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
think i'm trying to think of verbs you know listening.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
You can easily share, and you can explore.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah, Okay, beautiful. So we got listening up on the board as a potential milestone.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:29.000
How about something like effective aliances toward the end?

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I mean we need to learn to do that but it's not going to be immediate. and and along with that is the process of those you know, generalization of alliances across multiple cultures.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Okay, great. So So wendy let's copy effective alliances, and then let's let's put another one before that.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Judy spoke to the process that enables effective alliances.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So but we could call that. Maybe the process of how we ally and federate, or something.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
How are we gonna phrase that? But that came before that.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Chen. Yeah, I wanna say, speaking from the standpoint of both past, present, and future generations, that one big change would be seventh generation, thinking the way it's actually met by the people who invented it which is not to think 100 and

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
40 years in the future, but to recognize there are always 7 generations walking through time.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000
If you have a good life, you'll know your great grandparents, your grandparents, your parents, your siblings, your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren, therefore any time there's a decision, to

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.000
be taken. You make sure they're represent us from all of those generations present in the conversation.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Love that? Yeah, Thanks again. Where? where would you place that on the continuum from?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
You know, 0 to 100. Where do you think intuitive?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
We learn to really long term and multi-generationally like that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I hope it's coming soon like 2020%, or something like that

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
That becomes a worldwide phenomenon we recognize that there's one human family.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:26.000
There's many tribes. there's one human race, and We need to really recognize that we've got to make it work for for all the generations.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Okay. Great i'm gonna make an adjustment to this to alright, Hey, Jonathan, could you take where you're writing?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:47.000
2062, and make that 100% instead of a date

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Okay, great. So Because we don't know the time at which exponential phase change is gonna happen

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Let's think about this as a continuum from 0 to 100%, no matter how long it takes right some of us might think it's going to be 10 or 20 years.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Some of us might think it's longer. but let's just kind of go 0 to 100%.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So we've quite 7 generation thinking is something that needs to happen here pretty quickly along that continuum before.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Okay, let's get some other some other key milestones on the table.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Centralized information and knowledge sources or connected ones and somehow we've got to get all this wisdom and actual solid science content, and other things in an aggregated mode of some kind accessible knowledge and do for that's that's also important from

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:04.000
the perspective of Academy. So it's good to have a hold of a difference in there, because we need the difference as part of and the scale tiny to large great yup.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Okay. Great thanks, Wendy. Judy, Wh. Where on a scale of 0 to 100 does that kind of occurred?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You think where we, towards the centralized and interoperable information and knowledge sharing a capability?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I I potentially tried to defeat a timeframe, but let's call it 10 to 20 years.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
But for the whole thing, or her segments of it, because I mean I.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Some of these things have been trying to happen for centuries and they're not there yet.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So what's going to take an epiphany of some sort to aggregate them?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But yeah, I I put it kind of in the 2 and a half to 3 range.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Maybe if get to the endpoint, we need to do it soon or not later.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I see part of this is affected some of those things do actually exist.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
They just don't exist in at they exist at a different scale.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So it's more about you know we've got a lot of those things.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:26.000
They're just not necessarily gathered if you like The issue, I see, is that it's sort of like. there are thousands or hundreds of thousands of aggregated knowledge content.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Areas, but they don't know the others exist and they don't talk to each other.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah. So i'm gonna i'm gonna invite us to.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
We've got that down i'm not sure who's on that posted.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I can't move it but i'm gonna i'd like to invite us to take that centralized accessible information and knowledge, and move it left towards in between learn to list and in seventh generation that's gotta happen pretty

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
soon. Okay, Great. And then we'll get into detail on on how these things happen.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So let's not worry too much about it what are other big milestones.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And again i'd encourage anybody who's capable of doing it, of thinking backwards.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I can go. so i'm i'm going from the perspective energy freezes, since we're terribly throws.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So we learn work to capture and generate. the humans learn work to capture and generate already available energy from natural sources that they could put in circular systems.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Humans learn how not to waste energy, because one of the biggest issues around energy is, we consume, more than we produce or humans consume more than they produce, and they are not in the right relationship, not understanding.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:55.000
So they. So the other milestone is humans, learns how to intentionally see, measure, gather, distribute, and use energy, and how to recreate energy circularly.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:16.000
If you will, you know, kind of from linear just consume and waste, and instead use, transform and generate as much as possible of just different types of transformations, understanding the nature of energy. in systems humans, also learned how they're dependent

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:32.000
there are an energy, and so understanding how to manage and manipulate themselves and others, and the whole world is energy opened up a completely different dimension of what became possible in inner exchange interbeing interflowing circularity of

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:51.000
energetic movements. So from the disconnected linear race and consumption, it became this interconnectedness reflected in both material as well as you know, unseen, realms of the nature of energy Okay, so beautiful

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
quilers. so i've i've created a posted here.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
We can move around, called under understanding energy and its types and flows.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And then, sometime after we did that, we learned how to capture, generate, and and serve in circular.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And i'll add in that word circular self-generating, Okay, beautiful.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Okay, Great: So we have these these issues related to energy that obviously fuel all sorts of other systems

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Jordan. This is bill i'd like to .

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:58.000
From the standpoint of business we need to recognize that society doesn't change, unless the influences in society are pushing in the right direction, or are encouraging in the right direction, and because most everybody of working age is working everybody is involved

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:10.000
in some kind of an operation, except the independent professionals, where they have some kind of leadership and business.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Owners, managers director, are very influential in creating either a negative or positive culture and influences, and so to influence the world for change. we need to influence people and to influence people.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:49.000
We need to get their positive attention and you have business leaders focused on the right things and rewarding the right behavior is going to be tremendously influential in achieving any goals in this entire thing, because we're talking about this

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000
grand movement of humanity Here

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Okay, so that bill i'm we're trying to express these in terms of milestone.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So so you you have a milestone that's something like at at some point we're influencing people at scale.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I think you also spoke to the need to transform the incentives in order to create that influence.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Is that correct? And then to create one more thing here.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I also heard this issue of attention right so i'm just gonna create this milestone called attention slash influence at scale that leads to transforming incentives and influence etc. leading to this is

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:52.000
cultural transformation. right? so. so down there we're getting towards this through line of transforming our way of being Jonathan.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I wanna comes up for what Bill just said, basically sums up what civil society needs.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And I would place distinguishing fact from opinion.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Encouraging trust for Db. behavior. I would place these early as we can possibly pull it off.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It takes a while for that to percolate its way through a cat.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Academy and education. so perhaps i'm over the optimistic that we can accomplish it early.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But I think it's a like like bill is saying it's a pivot on which a lot of everything else will.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Okay. So we got. We got a node on encouraging.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Trust we we have another one on differentiating or discerning factors.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Opinion. Yeah, Yeah, statements rather than so, Wendy. Let's take this I think I also hear Jonathan advocating that this kind of whole cluster of 4 needs to move left

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
substantially so we could kind of shift that left words a bit.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Okay, what happened? One of the one of the key features is that

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:46.000
On behalf of plants. animals air water soil one of the things that's required is that they're clean and regenerating themselves.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So i'm gonna put on one of these big milestones somewhere that we I don't wanna say this.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I I think this is worth seeing in the negative. but we, you know, stopped poisoning slash, alluding air, water, soil more positively, husband.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Our resources better. You know, in this case I really align with you, Jordan, that it needs to be stated kind of in this way because of the natural regenerative factor of life.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000
If we get out of the way it will create that healing.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And so if we stated in the positive as long as we're not losing what has to be eliminated.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah, I think some of these are worth stating in the negative when it comes to the tactics because they're we say, let's be better stewards.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
That leaves room for a lot of

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Okay, So so is eliminate solution

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Like eliminating pollution, is much like sooner than in 20 years.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:22.000
We have to start now to eliminate pollution. to give the regenerative capacity time to respond.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Okay, let's define. so? I think that's what i'm getting at with stopped poisoning or polluting the air water and soil.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Is that? Why, what you mean by eliminating pollution like we stopped polluting the environment.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So the regenerative capacity could kick in yes, sooner, cause it's gonna take a long time to fix maybe

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Sorry Judy Standard Positive maybe reduce talks human cause toxicity by 95% by X State.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's not gonna go away overnight again. there's a lot of in or shown the system.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But and it's not just pollution there's so many different levels of toxicity.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So reduce you in toxicity by x percent, by by S. X.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:25.000
D. that's great thanks good and I guess this is gonna be for a lot of them. So i'm hoping this is a as a as a foundational question.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Do we want to state things as in like not We don't we no longer want to add to it versus.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000
We want to remove from the entire ecosystem larger.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You know, super system, the toxicity by 95%.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Those are 2 very different things right so if we're reducing That means we're only contributing 5% of what we used to.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:59.000
If we're talking about removing all of that means we have also cleaned up areas, we have also transformed things that are talk currently toxic.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:07.000
So i've just throwing that. out. because I think that's an important question, and how we frame all of these things going forward, i'd say both are necessary Wendy.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Yeah, I agree, definitely i'm just trying to make sure we're understanding what we're writing, and which part comes first or second, or whatever.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I'm just i'm bringing it up for conversation yeah

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So for those people who were freezing the reduced human toxicity.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Did you mean both? or the question, i'd be probably just switch reduced for removing, and does removing include reduce, and it would seem to me it does, I think removing is a a progressive process because you can't remove all

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
of it instantly. So there's a Lot of stuff that won't get removed forever.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Chemicals are call forever chemicals cause they're there, and it's gonna take a really long time to get those out of the system.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But we can reduce the amount we're putting into it as well as remediation efforts to clean stuff up super fun sites things like that. So it's a both.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It's too prong strategy and both sides are are required That's why i'm sort of advocating for eliminate, because you have to eliminate first or your continuing to add while you're trying to

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
reduce yeah, we're we're a little caught in semantics here.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000
But well, I don't think it's just spanish I think it's time because you know you we we can't.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We can't instantly stop using internal combustion engines, for example, everything would just grind to a halt.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
It would be terrible, you know. So we have to have a transition plan.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:47.000
So as we're transitioning we need to reduce toxicity, we're putting in there clean things up and find cleaner, better ways of managing our energy in our time and our our ways of relating so all those things

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:57.000
are required. i'm gonna i'm gonna put some that some

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Just to take a little stab at this It might be be helpful if we do something like this.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's a cheat, but we could say something like you know social environmental regeneration.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:22.000
25, you know, 50, 75% complete. That kind of contextualizes that totality of things that need to happen both to stop the harm and participate in the regenerative capacity.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Hmm: Okay, So we're we should be noticing.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Now who's contributed and who hasn't because There's some voices and some people not speaking as much, and some, you know individuals, For example, there'll be some ideas there as Michael said so who's on the

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
table so far. Yeah, i'll just add in the the soil, water, and Mike microbiome.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.000
So if we, if we are very close to the 20 years down the road

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:12.000
The entirety of the work side earth we'll inherently know how to continuously create end of fragile systems, because we are inherently intelligent, inherently creative and being regenerative and operating in

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.000
networks. So that's very close to where we wanna be okay?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So let's let's create some milestone it creates the milestone that says kind of like right before this thing manifest. Did we got to a major milestone, or let's say 95

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:45.000
percent of Marianne helping her systems regenerative and outlined, or something.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Yeah, I want to use the word end to fragile because i'm reading that book which is such an awesome word.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Nature's inheritance and fragile right?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
So I don't know if that's okay so so great.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
This is great example of of this backwards thinking. so Marianne said.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Right before there, around the world. We understood how to create these regenerative, anti fragile, aligned systems.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And And so when we say, okay, you know, we reach the 95% kind of tipping point that speaks to Okay, along here from 0 to 100.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:27.000
There was some progressive transportation of systems from exploited out of alignment to anti fragile regenerative and alignment, etc.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
So I like that i'm gonna risk a

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I'm gonna wha What about like what about governments and legislation, or something like what what was there anything we can see in our minds that happened at some point that was like a major milestone where there was some kind

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
of a

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Well, if we could get agreement to participate in the Un.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Sdgs in a more uniform way sooner.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That would be part of what would allow people to then pursue the right research, to learn how to do it.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
In the in the developed countries, and consider how to provide resources to less developed countries.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.000
But it's pretty snarky so So what do we?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Wanna So I like that as a measurable milestone somewhere along here, like before human talks, toity was reduced by 95%.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:47.000
We had to have seen something happen where half of the governments and corporations of the world, or something like that jointly committed to something right.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:59.000
There's some big milestone. moment that I think we're kind of pointing there to aggressively eliminate and reduce super polluters.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I mean it's known what some of the most polluting industries, practices, and so forth, are the cost benefit Hasn't been made to the companies to really mobilize them to do something about it.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:21.000
They won't till they're threatened with being shut down i'm sorry.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Go ahead to get to your government governing question from the end from a community needs perspective.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I've got decision processes. better. like we've We've finally figured out how to how to make big collective decisions, what to do and what not to do. Hmm.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I know there's something about accepting the decisions that you don't necessarily agree with so holding difference.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So the decisions that hold difference. Okay. great. So so somewhere, so somewhere, really soon, I guess, Pete, i'm thinking just to figure it out how we're gonna make kind of decision navigation, governance type processes a growing tipping point

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000
of people are engaged in Okay, great, We We got some energy going there.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Okay, Michael.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Yeah, i'm i'm apologized for not being in a great place to contribute as much as I should.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But I wanted to share some of some of the thoughts regarding individuals which obviously greatly overlap everything that you know.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It's like individuals. I was I was sort of bucketing 5 groups of needs states.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Goals. you know things that are important, one being survival, air, water, food.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Then love belonging family friendship, then safety, security, equality, and justice.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Then assembly, movement, association, travel and communication, thinking, learning, freedom of thought, and all of those I can break down still further.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Those are kind of 50,000 foot views of of things that are important that overlap all the other categories.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It seems like so i'll i'll keep working on that one to to speak up because I had been unable to speak for a while there.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Okay, I'm Michael, are you are you on the road are you in a place where you can write where where I can.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:28.000
What sorry, where you can write i'm now at a place where I can write.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Okay, we would. You might kind of so so those were really well thought out, and I don't think we're able to capture it in stride.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Would you mind dropping those into the chat? I will. thanks, Michael.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I I wanted to I threw in another high level bullet point here in response to something Kilo put in, which is that before we get X percent of governments, institutions, corporations committed to a plan with funding in place

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
to accomplish it. There had to be this shift in consciousness or paradigm.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Where humanity understands the moment in as history it's interconnectedness, and then we shipped from a suicide pack of exploiting each other to a massive positive good staying so that's gonna unfold in

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
like this tipping point and so i'm just gonna suggest there's a milestone where it would get you know.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I don't know 10% or something of 2 kind of operating in this new way.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:38.000
That's enough of a political force that shifts Okay, Jonathan

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So, because, our society has a lot of uncivil aspects.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:38:09.000
That trace their roots to education. A lot of what I think is has to happen is somehow showing people that benevolence, trustworthy behavior, reasoning and things like that.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Or valuable to the individual. They work for the individual as well as for the global.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Yeah, beautiful, So jonathan i'm gonna encompass that i'm gonna add to this note here on this tipping point.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Strategy is shift in consciousness or paradigm shift in values that would include all those key things you're speaking to. And we could imagine we could imagine that that shift in consciousness is unfolding on a

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.000
tipping point, you know, from 0 to 3% to 10% to pulling the middle.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:57.000
So I think there's good intuition for that how that flows and then that about the 50 or 60% mark, I think, would be a great goal to guarantee everyone their basic needs that's impossible.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Right now, but I think we could build towards that, and that that would also help eliminate a lot of crime.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:23.000
A lot of jokes So i'm gonna i'm gonna throw that out here somewhere and say basic human needs for all.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Thank you. Breeze I hear expression

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Satisfied that Jonathan encourages people to not commit crime.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Yeah, yeah reduced is attractiveness of crime that's why T.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And sush crime. Great? Okay, of course. hmm yeah it's so not sure where to put this

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But essentially I think it's right around the tipping point area, and that would be that life is directly speaking to us, and the way life is going to directly speak to us is via sensors and our ability to understand what the messages

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:38.000
are that are coming from the vibrations of life in all of its spectrum, being interpreted through artificial intelligence in a transparent way, so that the artificial intelligence becomes an anonymic nervous

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:51.000
system of the planet in that way, then humans will naturally, I believe, move because life is creative and regenerative and intelligent.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And so with information, then quality decisions will be made in the movement will be much more rapid.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Hmm: Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna quickly add in So so what forced to speaking to is that within?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Let's say, 2 to 3 years our allies will develop the ability using these web 3 to have sensors kind of around the world that are giving us real time feedback on the health.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And well-being living system. that a combination of human intelligence and Ai can interpret.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And then forest I i'm gonna add in here something about a

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I don't know computer models that can make visible the

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Appways implications into the future, you know. Thank you.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.000
To me it is a combination of 2 factors.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:12.000
It is transparency because that's what this is doing is basically making the voice of nature transparent, which is currently not visible to us in many ways.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And it's also empowering agency meaning the source of that. If it's a human source, the source of that data is controlled by the source.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Maker. Yeah. So that's where I I was trying to put my piece in.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
So humans said, Human sense and networks and noticing what's going on as well as the senses.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:53.000
We actually need the human now, like because that will give you details that we will be noticed, or that there aren't sensors for, and that those are actually fitting towards well-being, because the stories we want to tell ourselves, new stories

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
So we need to be noticing what the the collective story is.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:11.000
If well-being is one of your aims is that i'm noticing, and i'm noticed it, and One is information. the other one is an input to human well-being that you've noticed

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:29.000
yourself in noticing you actually start to grow as a person, so it helps with a lot of other things, because we then have the capacity you to be not rational actors, but at least more coherent actors, so something about becoming

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:44.000
coherent actors as senses in the system yes, i'm going to add that yeah, that's becoming close.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Hear it sensors and actors and the system Okay, we got We Wendy and Judy and then I'm having trouble getting things integrated from the text Kilo and Bill had some dreads going that I'd.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:14.000
like to pull in at first yeah sorry i'm I'm having hard time taking notes and thinking about my my the the voice I'm supposed to be representing at the same time.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So I think one thing we're missing like Well, first I want to echo what Michael added, and he's thinking about individuals, and i'm representing families and communities I believe so it's almost like the

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:42.000
it's a cross-section because they need to benefit from the systems working better together.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So one thing that might be missing. A lot of the pieces have already fallen in.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:45:17.000
One thing that my team missing is creating feedback loops for expressing unmet needs and elements of you know, or and moments for celebration

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So that kind of man, maybe that could be headed by like creating deeper connections

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
So for me. it's hard to frame it I'm sorry.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Just one more thought wendy it's hard to frame it just for in my for me it's hard to frame it just family, because I feel like that's so.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Such such an important thing for everything. So i'm having a hard time.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Yeah, don't don't worry right now, we're just working on high level framing through our different lenses, so don't worry about framing.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Just feel free to frame it all. So I want to capture what you said.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Feedback loops for i'll put it so I can put it in.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So yeah, it was for on met needs to moments of celebration.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Okay, perfect. i've got that if you want to modify it it's right under scalable and still some generate.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
But yeah, exactly so. we're gonna need to yeah be able to listen.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:32.000
So before, just just on that subject to feedback loops you go down the whole path of cybernetics, and such.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:41.000
It's much better with the experience of these things to keep it not while there has to be feedback.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.000
The narrative is actually feedback, and it's important not to have it x and causal, you know.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So x came from y, but more an ecology of things that happen together.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So feedback goes down a very specific path which is probably not quite the right word.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:08.000
It's about the relationship. yeah so we'll We'll get in the details on how we do all this. we're just trying to get get the milestones.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Right now. ken. thanks. thanks so much for for being here in between your calls.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Could I take a minute just to invite any any pieces or gaps, or anything that you'd like to get on the board on your way out?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:38.000
If you're still here I think this is a really great start, there's a lot of stuff that could go on here. I would encourage people to check out the World business Council for sustainable development their vision 20 over 50 new roadmap for

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
business. Really, it's exactly what you're talking about here? they go through and start with.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000
How do we get to a sustainable world by 2,050, and work backwards decade by decade in 9 separate areas, including

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
What's their energy and buildings and transportation and all that.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So it's really worth looking at. because it's it's very like, only done my friend Bob Horn was the visual synthesizer on that and I just wanna say there there's one thing that's

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000
kind of at the back of my consciousness that's that's niggling that we'll let go which is power needs to be addressed here.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:26.000
There are people who enormous amounts of power and incredible egocentricity who are not at all interested in what we're talking about, and they represent genuine challenges to this.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
So that also has to be figured out. How do we?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:39.000
How do we go up against you know the the large defense contractors and the big energy companies who are you know they're riding high.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.000
They they see no need to change they're making billions of dollars, and so it's just I don't know how to do it.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I don't know myself, but I know that it's there it's something that very few who will take take on as a How are we going to handle this? and until we figure out how that happens. Those kind of billing influences are going

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:07.000
to be very, very difficult to overcome as we work on this project So it's It's just something that needs to be, you know, looked at and confronted and and brainstormed on it.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:15.000
How are we gonna how we can handle this great thanks again. Georgia Bellen was picking me about Bob Corn, too.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
So it'd be great as maybe a month or 2 from now.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Once we've done some more of this synthesize kind of pulled in the stuff the World business Council did to to circle up with them, and can revisitize things in a way.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
That can unite the networks a little bit so thanks for bringing that back in as well.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And i've really enjoyed everybody's contribution here. it's been been awesome to meet some new folks.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And see what's going on here so thank you all and wish you a great rest of your day, and I got a on another call in 3 min. here.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So i'm gonna go have a great day in thanks. you, too, .

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:58.000
All right, Judy.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Alright sorry for judy you're on mute

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Did I get unmuted click on it there's a dimension of capacity for human change that has to precede institutional change until humans start looking at the world differently, and believe they have individually the

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:32.000
capacity to change themselves, and the things that they interface with we can't have institutional change.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:47.000
So there's a human enablement piece that I see is quite important, and it's very the people who believe they can affect change have already been inulcated in that by family socialist but that's a pretty small

01:50:47.000 --> 01:51:06.000
percentage of the population that really feels they can influence change a lot of population feels they can't even influence minor changes that have their personal survivability, let alone address issues like where the water is coming from and with powers, coming

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
from, and how you connect with people in other parts of the world and all those things.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So there's a there's a change change capacity change agent role, change process.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Is it? It underlies all of this, and cuts across every sector

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Great I judy i'm adding that to this second nature.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Note we have on this tipping point of consciousness in paradigm that includes both the shift of values, the understanding of interface connectedness, and that restoration of agency.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And then There's also obviously the technology and process to connect rising agents to

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
So I'm having trouble, cause the the notes are getting crowded.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
But Wendy m. Would you mind just dropping a note in there?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Somewhere along that unfolding, tipping point of consciousness.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Kind of the technology platforms and process to empower that agency

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I think that helps. but i'm trying to get at the almost indigenous culture level of change.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.000
If people don't individual agency. they don't feel, then they have family agency.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Then they don't have community or neighborhood agency and i'm concerned about the large portion of the population that feels an absence of agency.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yeah I understood yeah, they're they're Yes, Okay, So i'm gonna I'm gonna take a minute to make sure we just capture these right here in parallel this share the restoration of agency and

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000
There's a yeah. So we could we could design a program around that, Judy right?

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:24.000
A program around a chipping point and consciousness rooted in some kind of experience that includes the waking to our agency.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And then the connection to the tools and resources that then equip and empower people to move into small groups and teams do check that, transform their their local communities. their families.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Okay, okay. So So we got that on the board.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Do. Is that complete enough for you to come back to it a little bit, Judy?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Sure keila

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Thank you. so i'm i'm going towards human self skills which will really help effectuate the shifts.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:12.000
These sort of tipping point types of shift. So one is talking about human emotionality, and, like the dilemma, keeps talking about the hygiene, emotional hygiene kind of like the brush teeth except

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:29.000
that if we were to be able to take equally good care of our emotional health, it would be able to engage well with each other, and with a world from a place that is peaceful, belonging, healthy, not ill as opposed to right

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Now, where there's a lot of crisis in drama and there are, there are skills and technologies to that that as people engage that way they become different as they become different than the shift happens because they become viscerally different once

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
they deal with the emotional garbage and triggers, and all of that.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
And then the other part is also the value of intuition and learning.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:10.000
The skills and technologies because it's not just whoa it. There are skills, technologies, very practical uses that can be honed, that everybody has some capacity for.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000
And once people learn that there is a completely different relationship with life as well as relationship with possibility as well.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
The relationship with agency empowerment, an interconnection between people.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000
So those songs opening to this soft aspects of humanity both from the healing of what's you know?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Broken and messy and horrific, and therefore creates a lot of the dysfunction in the world as well as just the empowered use of those skills and technologies which are inherently latently present in humanity but

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:58.000
not very well. use not very much use

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Thanks. Cuteo tried to capture that Jonathan That was excellent.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
As to Judy and Keelu and Wendy.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I propose that one of our very first steps be to create a way that it tracks a lot of kids these days to a fun way to learn these new ways of thinking.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Managing emotion. something, something like a a game comes to my mind you've heard me say this a lot, but because it attracts people who part ready for joining the institutions.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And those institutions aren't ready to help them anyway.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yup Okay, great. So a way to track and empower kids families you know It's something that's a that's a lighter way.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:15.000
We're completely aligned there thank you something about responsible it's it's I don't want it to be harsh, but something about being out to it's like a pre step for agency

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:24.000
is like the you could have agency it's like an awakening, so I guess the gamification is like a pre-step for that.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:37.000
But this acceptance of responsibility for the Miss and that has to happen at every level. Yeah, great.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I'm gonna add to this note here, on restoration of agency, I I and responsibility.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:55.000
So I I really understand what You're saying that the the sense of responsibility and agency kind of moved together is that is actually kind of what you're reflecting, Lindy.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Yeah, First of all, there's 2 flips on that one is it. you know this this move from my's not my fault to everything is my fault.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Yeah, and everything. My fault feels good, too, far but if you say everything is my fault, and if you follow say some of the Hawaiian traditions and Achilla would have a lot to add here it's the saying

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
i'm part of i'm part of the stuff of everything.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:38.000
And therefore it is actually you know my responsibility the fact that we're in. and the miss if that makes sense yeah, if you walk, yeah, cheap part of that change in consciousness is beautiful, okay, Let's: go, to Bill And then

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I wanna I wanna take a take a pause and bill if you could Back in some of those things that were blowing in there the chat that I wasn't able to get on the board.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Okay, there are so many interactive and complex variables and many of these things we're talking about.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:09.000
So i'm gonna throw some things out there as hopefully not excessively generalization kind of based.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I think the families and individuals benefit the most when they're needed.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Things are being met practically, and their life and work is purposeful.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
And this is the natural desires to be purposely connected to my own.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Inner admissions go strength skills who I really am, and believe that it makes a difference, and to connect with other people who I can encourage in their strengths, and skills and ambitions. and they affirm mine and in the process our our needs, are met and our

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:53.000
work is productive for us. and this brings up this idea of work.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:58.000
There are those who say the so called great resignation.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:07.000
This trend towards uninterest in career is a product of the laziness of millennials and Gen.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Z people and i'm sure everything's a factor right But I think for the most part there is some agreement by those who analyze it deeply that there is a dissatisfaction with the world the way it is and

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.000
there's a sense of a desire for purpose that isn't found in much work today.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I'm Well, i'm not gonna get into all the criticisms that could be levied.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000
But I think that's a factor if businesses and here's the punchline.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:01:01.000
If business is provided a sufficiently meaningful place for people to work, and met their net needs well, and gave their skills an opportunity and their diverse viewpoints and lives to contribute meaningfully to something that they really believed in then not

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:10.000
only would that produce a tipping point change, but it also would provide a competitive market for us against the companies.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:17.000
That accumulate power and tend to repress the world they're gonna those companies are fine.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It's just hard to get workers these days all the baby Boomers are retired, but they're with their corporate wisdom, and we can't get young people to come work for us in the department of resource

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
exploitation and personal oppression. you know we need recruits in that department.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Well, they won't get them so I think that this idea of creating an alternative form of business that provides meaning and and good sustenance.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It. It kind of brings to my long ago, during we saw dling effect in the entire society and people they they.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000
And then one last thing people have connections at work and they think, hey? I have this team at work.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
It's like a bowling it it's like the Bowling Club.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:15.000
But when they're fired they don't have that anymore, there's not real it's a sham community. but monitor gone his real community, and I think if work was different.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:28.000
It wouldn't create an artificial acquaintance community that dissolves as soon as someone leaves you wouldn't have people having to leave the same way, because we believe in a sustainable business model and a and a community

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:35.000
connection. So I think it's all connected in that way Okay, Bill.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:50.000
So just a few bullet points to capture that you know families and individuals needs being that meaningful work relationships liberation from meaningless work out of a necessary supply collaboration of these alternative business models real etc.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
So we'll capture that we'll kind of place it

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000
But yeah, that liberation from less meaningful work into more meaningful work also.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Yeah, Okay. So so let's let's zoom out a little bit.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Let's zoom out a little bit we've got Some of us have, you know, a little bit of time left here maybe 50 min.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:18.000
So let's take a pause and a and a minute of silence, and let's observe what's happening here.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Let's observe What's Happening and kind of reset and see where to go from.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Here just invite a couple of minutes to close your eyes, and just center. Just read a little bit together.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Kind of reset. let's try to send what's happening here Most constructed way to spend the next period of time

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Beautiful all right. So let's just pause in let's take a few minutes and just reflect on on the process.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Here what's happening, and how we can the best use of the remaining time? like I said, I haven't tried this before with kind of diversity of perspective so and different professional backgrounds and all that So you can get a sense of what's

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:00.000
happening, I think. but i'll i'll maybe be quiet time. just a couple of us with our cameras on right now.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
How are you doing? What do you think is happening?

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I i'm I think we should put those in sticky Still, what's happening is that's gonna happen more?

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I think We're making there you do some working as a group but it's a coherent group in emergence where something is emerging through us.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:34.000
We're all kind of drinking from the same source but honoring our individuality, and whatever strands we bring, and that's a process through skillful use.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:45.000
So this process of emergence by bringing us, into the space where we're not vomiting what we know, and coming from the place of this is what I know from the past, and this is what has to be. But instead.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
We're in this generative field because I don't know what's going to happen next.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
But I can feel words emerging from and so can others on the call.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I think that's 1 point and i'm very excited about that because I can see the future very much shifting through that way of engaging at work, and in the world, and then the other part is how much is available, and how

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:27.000
abundantly. there is available energy, insight, wisdom, different forms of training, different kinds of diverse background gifts that we are bringing, that get liberated in this way, where we give this space and permission to to engage in emergency in that

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:51.000
way if there's an abundance that is under appreciated and underrecognized, and i'm expecting experiencing it here, and it's really yummy

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:03.000
We also have a perspective on where we are sure so Oh, I'm.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:10.000
In i'm in 2 places hold on

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:19.000
That didn't work for me. but now I could hear so it's interesting, you know.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:34.000
One of the things. it's just a risen it is wondering what is the real purpose, or outcome of what would be.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.000
And I think that for me the it's happening at many levels It's happening partly on the level.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That? certainly. Klu was just speaking to which is really a human person level emergence.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:09:14.000
What's happening with the another level is almost feels like that there is a intentional seriousness of the whole experiment to see about actually pulling in real information that you know would become acted upon.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.000
And if that's the desired person of the group that's a different per user.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Then the purple of the group, one in an experiment getting tighter understanding or thinking, and all of that.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:45.000
So if it's, it's if it's the purpose to get serious outcome out of this then it would seem to me what Ken suggested, and what we know exists out in the world you see tremendously deep

02:09:45.000 --> 02:10:09.000
robust thinking already, and mapping already that has occurred over a lot of time by a lot of really smart folks, and it would seem to me that what might be lacking is a survey and a clarity around what might be able to

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:20.000
be taken right off the shelf and go through a very similar kind of process, and just turn around and say, Hey, wow!

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:33.000
You know again it's, it's that principle that turns around and says, whatever our impulse is, that we want to create, has it already been created?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:42.000
And and and where do we go with that so that's just kind of what it was there?

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:52.000
And then to follow. That how do we take what we're coming up with and merge with other things that already are covering a lot of it.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:11:08.000
That's really hard. We done just to respond with to that for 30 s, as I, as i've looked at those frameworks for us, I didn't find really the path from where we you you you can find the big layout

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:16.000
of what needs to happen across energy systems or regenerative bag are kind of the big, overarching things fine.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:24.000
When I look at the field of what we just populated around the deep new ones of human systems and and kind of consciousness and the restoration of agency.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:31.000
And some of those things I think we're forward for forming a really rich shared understanding of of kind of the core movement.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And then, when we layer in what the world business council did right, those will, those will illuminate like all the big pathways.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:44.000
And I think what we're illuminating here is some of the stuff stuff that I was a little bit unable to find in some of those framework.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
So I agree with what you're saying what i'm envisioning is over next.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Let's say, 30 days flush these kind of things out of the working groups, and the network of 100 or so people, or whatever that is.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:08.000
That's kind of moving with us so we're all aligned. and if we can kind of get that, and then layer in those other big pieces, I could see you know very short time down the road than having a fully actionable

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:19.000
plan that not only has validation from those big thinking groups, but that you know, 100 of us can see exactly how we can get there from where we are today, right through those steps into the larger scale.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So really want to honor and and agree with you that that'll be a key Step is then synthesizing all those larger frameworks in.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So I I see it's kind of bridging Vincent.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Oh, sorry, one little piece on that is that when you speak of working groups, then it may be that one of those important work groups might be to a identify which of those should be reached out to have a path of to reach out

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:00.000
to actually invite a representative that actually knows that work exceptionally.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Well to join a working group of synthesis, you know, certain way.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Not that the similar? To what way back, when, 40 years ago, they tried to do with the natural step they did do as a really way of where do we find agreement across all of this?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:30.000
That's actionable okay, great but let's if someone if someone's still in Miro i'm gonna stay present here.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:41.000
But if someone's in mirror and we could add a post it for this working group that would reach out and identify the other frameworks and ontologies that have done this and then kind of guide that synthesis

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000
process, but that you know somewhere soon in the next 6 months.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Then soon done. Thank you. So I just want to offer a brief reflection.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:10.000
From up until where we are so far today. During this meeting I like the emergence of what came out of like those different perspectives as well as the different milestones.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I wish that This process was made more clear so coming into the meeting. I thought that we were gonna be doing more of a project management figuring out what's gonna be done in the next 6 weeks.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:40.000
And if I knew we were going to host a sort of interactive brainstorm session to map out the goals of the entire world, I probably would have came prepared in some way, both mentally.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:50.000
But also I wonder if we could spend time you know preparing before meeting, so we don't start from a blank mirror board.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:56.000
There's so much work that has been done both that everyone here, including myself, knows of that.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I don't think we have the time to pull it into this process

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000
And so I don't know if that was the intention was to get what was on the top of our minds.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:21.000
But I find the need for having you know like a second brain where I store this stuff because it gets so complex that it's not gonna all come up in a meeting unless I am prepared in some ways.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:36.000
So So yeah, that that's just my reflection. and and I wonder to model that what what the process would be like for the rest of this meeting to get towards like that six-week plan or is that even the

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000
intention for the meeting today. So that way we can kind of yeah Jordan.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Even that would be that's where that that was where my intuition was gonna take us for our next was to say, Okay, we've got enough of this field.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:00.000
We can vary it up to other things then to to dive in, and kind of look at the next 6 6 to 12 weeks, so i'm happy to go there.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
The group feels that's right that we have half an hour, and then I think that would be a good a good place to go.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Thanks, Vincent, appreciate those observations

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Okay, any other kind of top of mind thoughts. I think we need to do cycles of what?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Just, Vincent just said, because I think what happens with emergencies.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Once you start bringing some of the other resources and some of the voices that were sort of less present in the room when we talked out, you know, 1011, 12.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:43.000
The sinus. you probably need a couple of cycles of richening and noticing and moving things sort of left and right a little bit, and not just believe that you've done it.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:50.000
One. so it's not just a single cycle and also there's something about connecting some of those up.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Well, so you know we may be out of I think it's a little bit, but there may be some things that really shouldn't be taken off, and we need to be but 2 what we just need to work on how harder to language it

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:11.000
better rather than just say, Oh, look that Doesn't apply this is the better one.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Thanks. wendy Yeah, where I think we'll get just done this ongoing iteration.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.000
We're we're getting the broad controversy of a plan that's hard for us to understand what we're working on.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:28.000
So we're trying to invite our intuitions to look at this biggest picture and see the pieces that would happen to move Vincent, on the six-week plan.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:39.000
The reason that i'm starting with this broader picture is because if everybody's not oriented to what we're doing, then it's hard to know if we're going to do the next 6 weeks so that was

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.000
kind of the purpose to start from there backwards. plan. Then we can take a slot of that and go okay based on what's immediately at hand.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:51.000
What could be accomplished over the next 6 weeks and Then we'll get into quick iterative cycles and then i'm also envisioning.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Taking these other frameworks. like. once you've developed like the ones, whatever that World Business Council and those will start to form a critical path project schedule, and and then we'll be able to see how We're, moving along that

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:11.000
and Wendy, that'll get iterated you know every couple of weeks at least monthly. So that keeps moving. Marianne.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Yeah, I just wanted to make a note that a lot of the stuff that was in the chat not get reflected in the board kind of building on what Vincent and Forest was saying.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:33.000
You know there is so much not there. but you know it's the first draft, and I think it was great that you just made us jump into the defense.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Okay. great So if we were to their last 30 or so minutes here,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Would you guys be willing to dive into a look at the next 6 weeks with me?

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:52.000
And kind of see what's immediately at hand and how these different pieces feel, and then

02:18:52.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So that would be one thing. So how does that feel as a use of our our next 30 min to try to get concrete on the next 6 weeks?

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Anybody get significantly object to that? Okay, Great. And then

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I agree with marry on what you just said there there's a lot there in the chat, and a lot of processing of what we did get on the board?

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Would there be a couple of people that would be willing to schedule a time to work with me on kind of sorting out, both going through the chat and then sorting out the the board a little bit to get a better intuition and kind

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000
of tying that back into whatever we talked with for that next 6 weeks.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Is anybody interested in that lift actually can I just ask for a Moment's pause.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
My brain is : booing out my ears.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Yeah, And so the questions you're asking are like not So if we could just take a pause for a second.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:58.000
So the first just to consider the first question light of all that's gone on the board, and the nice reflection? So your first question was, Does it make sense?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Does it feel right for the next 30 min to move into a what feels most alive for us to accomplish in the next 6 weeks?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Was that right? Okay, Can we just take a breath? Just absorb the question and kind of see I need.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I need a minute to see what emerges just in response to that.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Thanks. Yeah, ,

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:06.000
So I have a thought I like what we did relative to okay let's dream big, right.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Let's dream this whole thing is done and then pull back from there the pieces that we would need to have as our stepping stones to get from where we are to where we need to go.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
What I would love. What feel really great from my perspective is to use time either.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Now or in the next session to say what's most alive for people in the meeting that they're already working on rather than looking at the board, and saying what seems most important on the board, which for me would be much more of

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:57.000
an intellectual exercise, and instead, say what's already happening where is there already movement, whereas there already action and I know i'm guessing, Jordan, you know where a lot of those pieces are but i'm guessing to that a lot of the people in

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:02.000
the room. don't see the fuller picture it might be nice to share with each other.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:14.000
This is what i'm working on and this is how I think it could relate to Meta Project. so that we're almost doing the opposite Here's what's currently alive here's where we're going okay which things Now.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:21.000
are starting to reach towards each other already, that, with just a little more effort or a little more energy, would just go.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Check would just connect them, because I think the connections are happening already, and I would rather make this a heart-centered, meaningful, purposeful exercise, instead of an intellectual exercise

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Thank you, Wendy

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I agree with wendy but I also feel We didn't finish this map, and we the ground the ground. We didn't do the ground.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:59.000
That's what we need to do next. So it feels like we need to take the next level down from the 5,000 to say, Okay, this is the next step to do all that.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:07.000
So that will help. But again, when you're totally agree we we should be linking with what's going on and energy that's already moving.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Yeah, Okay, great. So So we just had expression of the 2 things and I think it's a 100% of both.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
So, Marianne, What I heard to express is in my mind.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:28.000
We got maybe just down to, you know we kind of did the 50,000 foot level, but we didn't really clarify it so we can do that and we maybe got down to about the 30,000 square foot level, and we didn't

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
get any anywhere close right, but I I think we got

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So my second my second question. When do you have room for my second question?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:48.000
So my second question was, if a couple of people would have energy to help me process that board asynchronously, and try to kind of clarify and place everything out

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And then, once we have a clean slate, I think, coming out of that, our goal would get B to get like a clear 30,000 foot level, and then we could schedule a session to drive the near term like next quarter down to ground would

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.000
be kind of my suggestion, Marion, so that would give us that view.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:12.000
And then if we match that up with what wendy's saying on Okay, and what are the streams of energy that are already present and emerging, then then we probably see how those met up.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:27.000
So how how does does that approach sound? Okay, to accomplish both sides of the kind of strategic and emergent together

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Judy, I see you talking on mute

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I think we probably could do some of that now, but I think we need a homework assignment Queen.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Now in the next meeting, in the sense of the the complexity and depth with which this needs to be considered on multiple dimensions.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And I think another question I have that i'd like us? to address next week is, How do we reach to the agency that is already, in effect, so that we're not creating from ground level things that perhaps exist already in other.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:32.000
venues that could be partnered to address. We need to think a bit, I think, about the mechanics, of how we connect the growing structure and the connectivity of other people to these initiatives and thoughts

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Wendy and wendy my thought is that we as a community quote I don't wanna use the word should icon something at the sort of low level of granularity.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:26:03.000
That's just a little experiment to our willingness to actually do something at a personal level, because I think it's it's really good that we're working at you know an upper level and trying to land up for other people but there's nothing

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:13.000
like trying to change yourself at the same time your you're attempting to alter a situation in which other people might change something about.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I'm going to do x a commitment. piece it comes back to self action and if you can't do that, then there's a problem of the first order there.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Okay, So so wendy i'm gonna accept that homework

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:38.000
And I think I think we can get there, maybe by. So I.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:52.000
So I think if we combine some of these streams, if we if we finish this kind of strategic approach, and and can kind of see what what could be done over the next 6 12 weeks, if we then look at the emergence, streams, of

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000
energy. Then we'll have a really good lay of the land over the next 6 weeks, and then maybe we can get there by next week.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Wendy, and then I think that would be a really good idea to to look at what you're saying and go.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Okay, What? What are the little things that each of us can engage and commit to?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.000
And how do those stacked up? And you know, How do we?

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
So does does that sound? Okay, kind of complete the framework.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000
And then maybe next week, or or so we'll get there I think, yeah, it's about self change as much as anything else.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Yeah, So i'm choosing something, whether it's on on everybody else's board or not.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:42.000
So it's about self responsibility in relationships beautiful thanks Sandy 20 M.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I've lost my train of thought so I think i'll just put my hand down.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Thank you.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Okay, you beautiful. So let's okay so Jordan.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I guess this is really directed for you and I. if the a lot of the things people are saying are already incorporated in the flow that I put together on the master flow board.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:37.000
So, including the commitment piece that wendy Alpha was just talking about bringing in other resources that people were talking about working to create partnerships. if partnerships are necessary in order to activate or enable

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.000
something. So i'm just throwing that out to the room too.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.000
I'm doing my best when I come away from these meetings part of the reason why my head explodes is not really because what's happening in the meeting?

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:56.000
It's because of all the connections my brain is trying to make to all the things, all the flows and things that I'm putting together in order to be of service to the group.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:07.000
So when the timing is right, there might be a nice time to share some of those pieces, so that other people feel like these concepts are captured, and that we're not feeling like we're losing threads.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:18.000
If they don't get keep getting spoken into the room i'm trying my best to capture them and put them down, so that when we get to the right moment in time they will resurface and we can trust that they will

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:26.000
resurface, and not get lost so i'm just throwing that in there as a as a parallel piece.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Great. Thank you, Wendy. thank you. wendy Yeah, I think i'd love to take kind of what surface today.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:42.000
I agree with you that I think we've reflected most of the logic and and we can use it as a little mirror.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Maybe making adjustments, and then, when we present this back, we could present both kind of the cleaned up forward at the 30,000 foot level, and the process flow that'll help eliminate how people get progressively integrated and moved

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:05.000
into agency in action, so those 2 pieces will probably eliminate illuminate a LotJonathan had his hand up for a little while before.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I don't know if he's yeah thanks.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Each of us has a passion, and I see this group as eager to gather that passionate energy and help integrate it into the whole.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And I I find that a bewildering process.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I? What am I trying to say? I think this is great.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I think that wendy mcclain's suggestion that we identify the piece we want to work on.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:07.000
I'm eager to see that happen

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:15.000
So let's let's take wendy's suggestion, and Jonathan i'm i'm sensing.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I think we I think that was I I wanna say thank you for running through that experiment and orienting and kind of, and kind of learning this process, and I think when we clear up the board and present it back it it will

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:41.000
be useful. and orienting and I also know it's a lot to dive into this, so so we can just kind of relax. let's go to the board and stop doing what we were doing and let's pick up

02:31:41.000 --> 02:32:11.000
on Wendy and jonathan's thread now, let's take sorry I need to do a shared screen There

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Okay, So let's kind of so we all kind of have a feel for this, and I feel like there is a fairly

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I'm an intuition for how this will move which is great and Wendy, I think.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Yeah, I think it'll be really illuminating to connect this up to the flow, and the actual process for integration and the starting that river.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And then I also wanna just want to get and speak to for a statement that there's been a lot of work done at like international levels on the big system. stuff.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:57.000
So this kind of all will float together. I think so so let's pick up on Wendy.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And jonathan's statement to go to kind of passion, and what's alive because it'll be be less less energy draining here.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
So let's take let's take 10 min here and just highlight.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Anything that's particularly of live or anybody or that's kind of emerging that kind of immediately over the next 6 weeks.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000
You'd feel like might somehow tie in or they'd lead to some of these pieces.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And we'll just see getting anything on the board and then Vincent. Maybe i'm thinking maybe next week we'll dive into the kind of planning of the next steps based on based on this deep dive and

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:45.000
take a closer look at the next 6 weeks. Okay, so so Wendy, can.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I can I invite you to to just share share a little bit more about the threads that are emergent for you, that you, your scene could advance some of this that?

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:05.000
We've been talking about a little bit

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Yeah. yes. So for me to relate it to the pull exercise with.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Take me a few minutes of silence to figure out the best way to do that.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:24.000
So you want to go to someone else first that's fine or otherwise.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Yeah. So i'm i'm gonna share a couple just a couple things, Wendy, you're saying some people might not.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:40.000
No! but so so we have opportunity to launch in partnership with the with the Un.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.000
And future capital funds and contests around the Sdgs.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Immediately at hand. So so that's a really fun opportunity that I think will create stories that will help start to fuel engagement.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000
And we so, for instance, if some of these these things are out there.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
If some of these things up here on the board and we're not sure how to do them.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:13.000
But we know they're critical for steps to to starting the whole movement and shift.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:27.000
One thing we could do is is, we have clear opportunity to be able to articulate that, and set up contests or other things that would draw the best ideas from around the world that then could be kind of progressively implemented quarter by

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:33.000
quarter, so that's one emerging threat of energy that's a really high opportunity.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:43.000
To throw down. Another thing is a percentage of those flows.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000
To infrastructure. so we've been we've had a lot of work happening.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Particularly in this group, with infrastructure builders, so that been working to lay out tools in advance of all this stuff being required.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:09.000
So we have a pretty significant opportunity, I I hope, over the next 90 days to activate funding stream to fuel that infrastructure which is a really exciting, emerging energy flow that could change some things

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:17.000
So those are just maybe a couple a couple of things i'm gonna throw on this board .

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I'm gonna throw on this board peak plus Jordan plus lf c plus future capital interest in markets.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Is it? So if we if we imagine all this emerging energy it's going to need to get matched up in marketplaces, and we've we've got several places where energy is really

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Yeah, I see, I see increasing potential for partnerships. Right?

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:11.000
So what's emerging behind the scenes is a is a recognition of how many people are interconnected by one degree a separation.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:19.000
And I think there's gonna be increased opportunity to capitalize on those inter relationships.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:37.000
So an example. Graham, boyd is newly aware in my in my mind just today is a even though i'm not sure he's ever attended any of these meetings, but quite a few people in this group know him

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:54.000
know his work, have direct connection to him, and is, it seems like an integral piece that then extends out and could help draw together some of the pieces here for more immediate activation, because of the trust and connections that are already

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:14.000
established. So that's what I to me that's like a low hanging fruit kind of thing, so that would you know that piece of it which is the governance and financial piece then draws in the technical piece the

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:26.000
connection piece so and to me that's very big right so I don't know if that's making sense to other people, and i'm happy to describe it more detail but partnerships.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:38.000
I would say as the overarching for that

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Another one is choosing areas of focus. I think one of the things that we've been tripping over a bit as a group is not having an area of focus.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:39:07.000
And while I think that's been smart up into this point as we focus on how we want to be together, how we form trust with each other, and how we do process, I think it's time start moving towards action, and picking

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000
areas of focus will help us practice acting on things together.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:19.000
I see Meta project being a place in an organization's not the right word, but a a Co.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Call collection of people that are trying to advance collective action together towards moving any piece down down the line. Right?

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:36.000
So it's not very well said yet. but if If we're focused on a process for collaborative action.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Then picking areas of focus will help us get better at that process of acting collaboratively together, which requires all the pieces in play.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:59.000
So I'm: looking to improve that process by starting to pick areas of focus, and that goes back to the first one, which is the areas that are most alive for people.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:15.000
The things that are in greatest motion should be, in my opinion, our first areas of focus, because just improving the collaborative action piece is going to be hard enough, and we should capitalize on the areas with the most momentum and the most energy

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:26.000
in order to practice the other pieces

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:49.000
I see a parallel, a pack, 2 parallel thrust coming together, one being person to person, connections, relationships, partnerships, self-actualization, community, actualization becoming better versions of ourselves.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:41:04.000
All of that piece, the person to person piece in evolving in parallel with technological advancement in support of the person to person.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So i'm seeing those developing in parallel and starting to meet now. And so that's another kind of big, huge thrust that is beginning to happen. that is activating all this wonderful stuff.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I feel like we've been talking about today. but I keep seeing them in those 2 main like huge threads huge pipes.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Okay. see other hands raised. i'll be quiet Jonathan and kilo wendy's Point and others as well.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:51.000
The idea of collaborating, I think, is gonna ask each of us to learn some new skills.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:42:00.000
One of them could be and correcting other people's ideas to be developed.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:08.000
That's an emerging skill I see us learning together.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Sorry, stupid phone. So education skills acquisition there's some important. Well, how do you say existing training? that would help us hold up great thanks, Jonathan Caleb: I thank you everyone.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:56.000
And of course, always love what everyone's saying and very much want to put a big exclamation mark behind both Wendy said in terms of following the momentum. and that is I don't think I can emphasize enough

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:11.000
from sort of my perspective, and maybe training both as innovation under and that's a very particular kind of training where we look at momentum. and then you experience that and you make funding decisions around that as well as someone with some intuitive and

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:19.000
soft skills and those types of trainings around what it means to human and different ways, different cultures.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:30.000
And there is this notion of grabbing energy worries that now maybe we don't have enough skill to grab energy from the wind or grab energy from the water, or do things that Shamans do.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:38.000
But we can recognize where there is momentum, and almost do the equivalent of grabbing energy of that.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:53.000
And it is actually a particular it's a technology and this skill set. and it's not that hard to develop It has more to do with how you see and knowing what to look at than anything else. And so if we notice what's

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.000
alive, and where there's momentum we have so much more I don't know how to say it in non abstract terms.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
I mean a shortcut abstractly would be.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:22.000
We have a lot of help if I wanted to say less abstractly, we're just more likely to succeed and find resources in ourselves and around us, and probably many of us have had that experience.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:31.000
But you can use it as a tool as a practical tool, not just something that you talk about.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Great thanks. Cuba

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Great thanks. Cuba

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Judy.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Just on mute i'm still sitting here thinking about what we can do as individuals.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:11.000
What we can do as what is now Meta in its current existence, and what the potential is to connect to groups that are somewhere in the actualization timeline of already working on these things.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Because I think all of these big issues do have many people around the world working on them and identifying what our role is, or how Meda can facilitate the flow of information or the connection of those actions.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:34.000
To enable growing of action in many areas, you know.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Do we want to focus on growing the individual action through technology enablement that lets people connect and then do their thing wherever they are?

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:53.000
That certainly wants but there's also the recognition that wisdom is ongoing, and it's development in other existing entities.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:46:11.000
And we could find that we're not keeping pace with the change in wisdom, in important areas, unless we have a mechanism to do that

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Okay, beautiful. Okay, good. So so to to kind of zoom out, we were able to

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.000
We were able to copper a lot of grounded in.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Thank you. I keep losing this but we were able to kind of we're able to see zoom out and and take the big view.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:46.000
We were able to spend 10 min kind of looking at those emergent nodes, and I think there's a good intuition for how this match up we have, like Wendy pointed out a lot of exciting partnerships and things

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:52.000
converging right at hand that'll change what's possible definitely through transforming the size of the network.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And the the people engage so anyway. thank you guys so much so let's go to a quick retro in our last 5 min.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Here Alright, That's enough to yeah i'd love to get some, some feedback, and some learning on, and how that went, and how we can do better.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:21.000
So let's do okay. yeah ke though go ahead I noticed that Pete didn't speak a lot, and unfortunately he left.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.000
But i'd love to know how this was for people who didn't speak a lot.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Yeah.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Wonder that difficulties when their screen share is that at any given time I can only see the few people who are participating the most.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Sit down. that's something that I need to figure out just sort of.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:58.000
I think you could actually have someone who took that role. I mean.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:08.000
I I attempted to do it once but I couldn't see who was talking more to sense. There was some of the views that were missing, and perhaps my own a little as well.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:26.000
So there's something about being in a role and dedicating and convening yourself to that role And then, having other people noticing for you what you're not able to notice for yourself Yeah, way to deal with that that works really

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Well, planetary care is doing rounds because every knows i'll be asked all the time.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:48.000
So just have to make sure they're short not long but just doing round because everybody gets but to answer your question so much i'm absorbing.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I'm just taking it all, and drinking and drinking I I couldn't even quite catch everything in the chat is so whilming.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.000
But I love it it's really challenging if you're trying to watch the mirror board.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:05.000
And the chat it's it's almost like you need 2 screens which can't this particular workstation.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I don't have I find the difference between the 2 screens is is really key as well.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Having that, you know, I I think the point that venture brought up was a really good point of learning relative to this type of experience which is framing and really providing clear framing I had a time.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Of knowing where that is. And so that because the framing goes into match created expectations, if there are any that come in

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:54.000
The other thing that I really appreciated. Jordan, was you pausing after?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:13.000
There was a lot of post posters on that, and spending the good amount of time for the rounds for reflection of the process there, and that felt like any very rich and fertile opportunity to bring out the pieces

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:19.000
of the iteration

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:27.000
So so we've got 3 min. here let's let's do 2 quick sixty-second waterfalls just to just to close out.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:41.000
So first one, let's drop into the chat just anything that particularly worked well, or was was energizing or effective today on the first question, and then the second one will be what we can do better. So let's just focus on this

02:50:41.000 --> 02:51:11.000
first one. what we're 12 a day what was energizing

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Alright, and whenever you're ready let's go ahead and water fathers

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Okay, and then last waterfall Question: What can we improve on next time?

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Can we do better in the future, or anything that felt frustrating?

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Or tee energizing, I guess let's frame it positively based up, based on anything that was de energizing.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:46.000
What could we do better in the future

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Alright as we approach 3 o'clock here whenever you're ready.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Go ahead and drop those 10

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Beautiful.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Thank you all really, really appreciate it, which is great. This is a good hard process, and I love being able to roll up our sleeves and do the work.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:07.000
And I hope that over the next few weeks as we turn some of these working things into artifacts and shared understanding, and move towards a little bit more structure.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Some of these questions on what we're doing you know in each cycle. and why and why it's the right thing, and how the energy notes are meeting will make a lot more sense.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:23.000
So, anyway. Thank you. Such profound gratitude rich session, so much to mine in the chat. And i'm just really grateful.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Thank you guys for being here and once again. I know I'm repeating myself that I'm hopefully, speaking on behalf of Mayos.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Thank you, Jordan, for holding this, and for experimenting, and for the skill and the mastery and the heart.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:48.000
You because we're all we're all bringing it the way we're bringing it because you know again, you're leading it this way, and we're becoming stronger as each other.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:57.000
But I think it's also encompassing us to really appreciate what the difference you make.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Thanks everyone. alright. echo marianne's post to good luck tomorrow.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Yeah, yeah, thank you tomorrow. it'll be kind of a different process but yeah, we'll we'll learn how to do all this and get better and better.
