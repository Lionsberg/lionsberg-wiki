00:48:55	Wendy McLean, NY:	+ 1 Wendy E... would love to have sensemaker help us with this!
00:53:44	Wendy Elford:	Tx Wendy M
00:58:07	Wendy Elford:	When ready, I will use this board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPah2AgE=/?share_link_id=311708717247
01:00:51	Wendy McLean, NY:	Thank you so much Pete for this clarification!
01:13:48	William Larson:	I'd like to be a part of that comm team
01:17:01	Wendy Elford:	+1 PeteK : Care with bias those people with time become the people whose ideas dominate
01:19:26	Wendy McLean, NY:	Agree, Pete.  If we stay within the volunteer efforts, then clarity of focus is more important in order for people to create their individual priorities, and this takes longer as people work on it only when they have time.
01:21:24	Wendy Elford:	away for a few minutes - BRB
01:28:41	William Larson:	+1 Wendy M.; we need to know where things are happening and where the energy is currently flowing.
01:31:26	Judith Benham:	+++ Wendy E re the interface of us with the rest of the world
01:38:03	Pete Kaminski:	Left-hand move. In Dialogue Mapping, you typically map from left-to-right. For example, you have a question, you list possible answers to those questions to the right, etc. Often, group insights / convergence happen when a group realizes that there's a more fundamental question than the ones they've been trying to answer. That question is placed to the left of the current discussion, hence the term, "left-hand move."  - https://wiki.fasterthan20.com/view/Jeff_Conklin  the notion of a “left hand move”. Occasionally a discussion can generate a new root question which, by definition, has to be tacked on to the extreme left of the map.  Such a left hand move is extremely powerful because it generally relates two or more questions or ideas that were previously unrelated (some of them may even have been seen as a grenade). - https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/dialogue-mapping-a-book-review/
01:42:54	Forrist Lytehaause:	Blessings all. Much gratitude, Jordan!!
01:43:05	Wendy McLean, NY:	Have to go today!  Bye Everyone!
01:47:02	Judith Benham:	++ Pete for all your comments today, And love the left hand move.
01:47:21	Pete Kaminski:	Thanks, Judy :-)
01:47:47	Killu Sanborn:	Great meeting with lots of progress. not in a place I can keep video or talk but enjoying the progress and what arises.
01:48:07	Wendy Elford:	Tomorrow is fine
01:49:53	Pete Kaminski:	"I Like" - what did we do well that we should continue.
01:52:10	Judith Benham:	Wonderful energies, openness, shared thinking,. Great process discussion. Love communication planning.
01:52:19	Jonathan Sand:	I liked the initial framing intentions, helps us to know what to introduce. i liked the recognition placed on work already contributed
01:52:19	Pete Kaminski:	I liked that we had some tension and resolution during the call.
01:52:19	William Larson:	I liked that we were able to move flexibly to issues that were top of mind, and especially ones that concerned the essence of how we can actually function together and communicate efficiently.
01:52:19	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I like how the important things emerge through our time together... I like the deep insightfulness of the group... I like the CHALLENGE of balancing allowing the deep perspectives to emerge and get spoken, and the TENSION of wanting to get those into more of a STRUCTURE... I like that people are patient while all that tries to emerge and bring itself into being...
01:52:20	Trae Ashlie-Garen:	I Liked - reconnecting to the energy;   I Wish - for truly collective values-based exploration and decision-making among more people from more walks of life;   I Wonder - about what the universe is up to, and what is being woven, and how we will attune ourselves more deeply to it and respond where and when necessary
01:52:26	Killu Sanborn:	liked moving efficiently while also slowing down to fold in what was arising. liked creating and discussing path, groups processes. liked that tensions in what is not optimal got brought up discussed and solution potential moved forward. communication plan great!
01:52:31	Wendy Elford:	We surfaced some elephants - that we are doing communication / wiki / complexity well enough
01:53:34	Pete Kaminski:	"I Wish We..."
01:56:19	Killu Sanborn:	I wish we were more aware publicly about what has been emerging as of highest potential value short term, medium and long term. sometimes I forget but it is useful to keep front of mind and heart, to balance the ever present tension of wanting more faster better. wish there was more time! not facetious- anything we can do to create a sense of not being so rushed, wish for it. if I find it elsewhere, will share. hope you all do the same, as it doesn't feel personal and feels like many of us feel it.
01:56:19	Trae Ashlie-Garen:	I Wish - for more clarity on the meta and micro to emerge sufficient for each person who is willing, to see and own their piece with greater enthusiasm and momentum
01:56:19	Pete Kaminski:	I wish we didn't have to -- and then try to -- cover so much varied ground in such a short amount of time.
01:56:19	Judith Benham:	I wish we had a tentative agenda b4 the meeting, with some loose time framing, and a way to tee up future discussions points near the end for net meeting for next time. Also offline assignments an option.
01:56:19	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I wish we... had transitioned a bit sooner to creating a shared map and understanding of what is up next and why (but I think that might have happened anyway, and maybe more powerfully, in a different want than I had planned, that I can just summarize after)
01:56:20	William Larson:	I wish we could spend more time sharing about the things we are working on, and discussing how much margin there is in our schedules. I feel like I am at times flying blind in understanding others' challenges and involvements.
01:56:20	Wendy Elford:	I wish that someone - ?Jason would you be willing? worked me with to articulate how we might approach complexity /  change to steady our approach
01:56:20	Jonathan Sand:	i wish we had / would be more concrete about forming teams and their purpose. I.e., establish minimal members, schedule a next meeting time. I wish we could be more rigorous about what topics we will and won’t cover. I wish we did more reflecting with good questions and pauses for thinking
01:57:35	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	I wish we’d know what we are doing next week before leaving today
01:57:58	Pete Kaminski:	"I Wonder - What Would Happen If We...?"
01:58:20	Jonathan Sand:	++ bill larson
01:59:15	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	Each came to a meeting with our highest priority task and made a proposal for how to move it forward in a breakout room.
01:59:25	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	(Oops) trigger fingers here
01:59:54	Judith Benham:	I wonder what would happen if we all (each) submitted, before the meeting, a very short summary of what’s happening, where help is needed, breaking news, new contacts and initiatives, etc.
01:59:54	Pete Kaminski:	I wonder what would happen if we had a couple more 60-90 minute calls each week?  I wonder what would happen if someone besides Jordan did a few of the things Jordan does every week for us?
01:59:54	Trae Ashlie-Garen:	I Wonder what would happen if we all could be meeting like this and contributing to the energy moving forward, AND have it be a part of our livelihood instead of off the sides of our desks.
01:59:54	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I wonder what would happen if we... committed to minimum standards of interoperability... that took less than 30? minutes per day, that brought the invisible things we are all doing to light in a way that invited the threads to be woven together for action / help / support...
01:59:55	William Larson:	I wonder what would happen if we had sufficient capital in right now to hire a couple key people in the group to handle communication and coordination. This would focus energy where it is hard where all is volunteer.
01:59:55	Wendy Elford:	I wonder what would happen if we could figure out and map the constraints we are working with to help people shift into more effective coordination / collaboration.
01:59:55	Killu Sanborn:	if we had a very clear statement of what is Meta Project, ready to share out loud with others. if we had a very clear shared intention, described in a future vision (when this has been successful, it looks like this...)
01:59:55	Jonathan Sand:	i wonder about how we would feel about each other if we knew (briefly) what they were contributing?
02:00:29	Pete Kaminski:	+1 Judy :-)
02:01:19	Jonathan Sand:	+1 judy and bill
02:01:23	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	++ Judy
02:02:09	Killu Sanborn:	++ Pete, Judy
02:02:34	Killu Sanborn:	++ Trae!!!
02:03:07	Jonathan Sand:	++ Trae
02:06:30	Pete Kaminski:	one of the wonders: "I wonder what would happen if we all (each) submitted, before the meeting, a very short summary of what’s happening, where help is needed, breaking news, new contacts and initiatives, etc."
02:07:32	Trae Ashlie-Garen:	I need to slip away, and will do my best to slip into Wednesdays as I'm able.  Much Gratitude, Trae
02:07:41	Pete Kaminski:	Thank you, Trae!
02:10:23	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Jonathan
02:11:30	Wendy Elford:	Signing off now. Thankyou.
