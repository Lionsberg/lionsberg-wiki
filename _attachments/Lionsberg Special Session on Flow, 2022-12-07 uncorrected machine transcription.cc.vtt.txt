WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, and then, okay, great, thank you and then I will hit record here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay, great, so it's December seventh, and we have a one special session today on flow, planning to kind of ticket, pretty easy in December is everybody going through the holidays, and Family time, and reassessing and kinda Use, this as a time

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to Consolidate, and be present build relationships with each other.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Talk about what's next, and then just as a little preview, i.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And feeling, somewhat called to kind of Jason. I think this is following up a little bit on the call with your group as well, so maybe do.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Some kind of like a 12, Week, series, or something to just go kind, of rapid fire through like the journey that we've been on over the last years, principles and Vision values Structure, calling all the different, parts that Kind, of that we Merged out of that out of our Study, Mantragon, and Different

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Models around the world, to try to present a more comprehensive picture of where we're at and how this all might fit together, so that anybody who wants to engage in that method of organization, and federation thinking so That's kind of where I'm where I'm thinking, we might go with that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Jason, we spend a couple of different groups that have asked for that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And so I'm thinking about rather than trying to replicate that maybe just doing like a 12 week series with whoever cares and might wanna Join, maybe Kick that off first Week of January, after everybody gets off back from the Holidays, so so Jason, I want to particularly ask

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you yeah, we'll record that we'll distribute it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That would let basically anybody start at week, one anytime in the future and then kind of follow along.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So it feels like it's almost kind of leaving Bread Trails anybody like week 3.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That's all one of the Recordings. Could go back to week one, and start Falling through

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But Jason, I want to specifically ask you because of the offer and they to your group.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Do you think that would that would work. Okay, to start something like that first week in January.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Okay, okay, perfect.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I think it'd be fine, that would give people a chance to Binge watch in March.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Send you to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, totally, okay, so we'll kind of we'll kind of shoot for that,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, so please, let me know if you'd like to be on the be on the list for that, and and we'll kind of try to Confirmate everything that we've learned a little last years these different lifetimes of work, that We've brought Together, present more of a structured Series.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Of that they could then lead to hopefully, the right combination of relationship and community building, and then also getting into action and enabling and supporting and all the Brilliant initiatives around the World, that We're All Aware of and Wants, to Make Sure Succeed, so Beautiful Okay, so so oh, Wendy Did You

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Want to say something, or, yeah, yeah, please.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I just wanted to clarify because you were talking, specifically to Jason and inviting that you guys could create this meeting.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I i'm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But then it seemed like you switched and said, So if you're interested which you did. You were mean, did you mean ever anyone in the room? Or is this something happening with a with a subset of people i'm not clear

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I would like for this to be as universal as possible.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So thank you for clarity, that Wendy. So what I was trying to communicate was that Jason and a couple of other different nodes.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I think our have would have expressed that it might be useful to have us all try, to get up to speed together.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
On what we've all been learning and where we've arrived at.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm, so I was just specifically, asking Jason, because I made an offer to whatever, the 10, or 15 people that were on a governance call to host, a Little series, and so I'm trying to close the loop on that offer I made and everybody, on this call is welcome and I'm

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Also gonna put it out on. You know, linkedin and wherever.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So if anybody in any of our networks would, like to kind of here the Consolidated Version of what We've all been learning, and at least you know, our distillation of what we've been learning, and Kind of arrived at just wanna create a structured, way to go through that and start kind of building

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Broader consensus and movement, around that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Okay, so another clarifying Question so would these be a series of meetings where you would present out more than Receiving in or is it an opportunity for people to share more of what they're, they're seeing

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I think we would want to balance those really well, and Wendy I'd take the Conversation we had earlier today, if you would like to up co design those sessions, we could try to balance.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Those really well, but I but I think ideally it would be something like presenting the kind of the key Patterns.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Let's say that we feel like the ecosystems kind of arriving at and the key things that might be Foundational.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And then I think as you're saying having creating a very strong forum, or Listening and Corrective Feedback on any places where those patterns as we describe them might not be the best Understanding that the Ecosystem has so there, could be maybe a Basic Process, of Presenting out our our Current

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Best Understanding, Listening and getting the Corrective Feedback and then Presenting back out the the Group's best Understanding, and then maybe after 12 weeks, we would arrive at a at a pretty close Shared Understanding of some of the the Foundational Patterns that Would enable Us to Do what we want to next year

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Does that sound appropriate

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I have thoughts, but I see Wendy's hand raised.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, beautiful. Yeah, when wendy please.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I think a combination of Facilitated process.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But also, maybe people producing their own bits of text, about what I think will work so you've got this sort of distributed knowledge about what is working what has worked well, over the last year, that takes in things.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That may not turn up. In a facilitated process, for a whole stack of different reasons, and it might mean that you have more voices people who aren't coming to your facilitated process for that particular closure because there are a lot of people who've been involved Over the year who have

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Some very useful insights about What works and what doesn't.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So we'll give us more places to track. If something isn't turning up quite the way we don't like it to because then we can sort of invite that voice back into the room say even just want to visit for a little while and then disappear, again, because it's always has the possibility of just becoming too.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Yeah yeah

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Refined and being open to not getting that right in and open prices with x number of people.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Okay.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Okay.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I think is always important. So anyway, I can, if whatever links people what if someone wants to run page, or page in half or 2 pages, or whatever I can work with that type of text just to give you a a bigger context, of what the process has ended up in a more spoke to spoke of prices, seeking

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Okay, so, so, what I hear you say when saying when the e is will have some number of people who want to engage in kind of the the Series we have other people dropping in or out other people might be watching the videos on Youtube or whatever you're inviting the process where we could invite anybody, who

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Is or kind of isn't in any kind of relationship to be able to submit in what they're perceiving about what we're talking about then you're offering that you could then process that and kind of help feed that all back into the group understanding is that correct

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Yes, it is and it's generally. It's possible in any scenario, as you develop your process to be a open to having the process, run a different way, but also from the content that comes from the process, so you can do it both ways, so that you

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, so, so wendy, I'm gonna take you up on this offer, because I've I've been really fascinated.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You've been advocating for this. I think this 12 week series is a really concrete time span in which we could work together for me to make sure, that we we honor all of the body of work you're bringing in with try to embody it and then invite it so if you're up for it

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I'm up for it, but let's do it. Okay.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Okay, the third reason is that I also I was one of the people who suggested that Jason's Projects could be a very good focus.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And so he and I've got a sort of separate relationship that's developed around tracking.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The results of those people. So it would be a third, lens on what the client is expecting as well as the people who, doing the producing as well, as the process that does the production so so we'd learn a lot.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay. Yeah, beautiful. Yeah, so, I think, we, so we have

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I think, one of the great things That's happened over the last couple of Months.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Is we've developed, this we've developed a deal of these projects that are immediately out there, including those and multiple people on this call that we would like to see succeed so Jason Forrest Others if you would like to beat those in we can talk about how those will relate but I don't want to get too.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So, I, thought, maybe, yeah.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Far on that today, because we're going to do a special session on flow let's go to Wendy and then I'll answer the questions in the chat, then I'll Tie up the session for today, and We'll see if we can Dive in

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Yeah that's fine my question was actually the same. So I think somehow closing this off would be great.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I, just wanna with with a couple of final thoughts. I want to put an exclamation point on wendy ease offer.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Okay.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I see, both the benefit of maybe even getting out something that people can answer over the holidays before the meeting to capture what the last year has been like I heard her say that and I just wanted to put an exclamation point on that that would be might be really nice to do a pre thing and then

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
A during thing. I heard you talk about the during thing during version.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yeah

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I don't know what to call it as really as it sounded really funny, that both are valuable

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Then maybe, a yeah. Okay, so maybe we do like a. So maybe we do a pre, like, a a session in December, we have some kind of process that unfolds over the 12 weeks, then maybe we get that

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I don't. Yeah yeah, just just saying you don't even need to do a session.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yeah yeah

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You just ever the people have had experience over the last you just send out the survey, but a session to create the survey.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Yeah, but then, then we could do one after, right. So, so I think if I have heard you well, wendy over the last year, if we did something kind of pre, during and then Host, We'd be able to.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Track in interesting ways with the impact of that was and report out on that that that sounds that sounds beautiful

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Yeah, and also, I can partner with Wendy and to to to design that cause.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I think it's important that it captures and and probably Pete.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:22.000
As well, too. It's important that it captures the sort of action to reflection.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Yeah. That sounds.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Yeah yeah

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And experience spectrum, that, we, yeah, and we. And we need to know where we're traveling on that continuously, and we, we, too, much of one in 2 little of the other

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Cool, I'd be into that wendy and then the other.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Okay, so no good, no please. Wendy go.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry it was just the simple question that a couple of people asking chat that I had from before, too.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I am my standard is to do the wise right.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Thing my thought was that it would that we would maybe do it at the same time.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But I am completely open so I think at this time we have a critical mass of people who are here that could engage very meaningfully based on our collective understanding that might, be hard, to regain if we'll move it so that was going to basically be my proposal that we replace

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This meeting time with kind of a A Structured 12 Week series, and then based on what on holds during that 12 weeks we reassess after that point and I could see a version in which there's

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Let's see there's 9 people on the call today.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I could see a version in which there's 5 to 10 of us that that want to engage in that I could see a version in which there's you know, Jason has a has a group, and many other people, on this group I could see a version in which there's 20 or 30 People there would be a

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:14.000
certain environment. And then, if there's more than that right, then we would get into more of a webinar type thing, where maybe there's, a fish Bowl type, environment with with other people that can observe, right, so basically, what i'd like to do over the next 3 weeks is take stock of

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
who's interested in that. Find out whether we have 5 or 20 or more people than that that wanna engage.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And then, basically we could work together to design what the sessions. Would look like.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So, when, Wendy voted for replacing these windings.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Wednesday calls with that session. So let's say what what that would look like.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Is the next couple, we take Christmas, week, and whatever off the next couple of weeks we could.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Have social or special topic calls. Then we start up in January with this 12 weeks.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Series, to basically try to consolidate everything we've learned.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Get it into a structured form that then invites follow up action and movement.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:14.000
After that. Does anybody have a different understanding of what the wise right answer. Would be or anyone objections better ideas

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Okay, for us, you ask the question, Does that sound okay to your consciousness, to to basically replace this meeting, time, okay, great, I see Michael nodding bill nodding okay, great okay, so, that'll be the plan then i'll i'll, work, as hard as I can to consolidate, you

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Know my lifetime of Work Lifetimes of Work, that I brought together with many others of you on this call into a compelling 12 Week, Series, so Let's Let's Talk A Little Bit Let's Just take 2 min to Wrap, that so Wendy E and Wendy.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
M would it be

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Would it be more helpful to you so you guys have both offered to work on the story side that would lead to a survey or an invitation in December of what's happened in the past we maybe have something, while the series goes on and then we maybe have a post story, that we can

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:14.000
When do you think this the meetings will take place for the 12 week cycle. Will it be will it be a replacement to these navigation meetings which I would vote for personally or would it be a separate set of meetings

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:27.000
tell so we can track this. may I, join you guys in designing, that, or would you prefer to do it? one on one without me

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I mean that deeply, honestly, of what the best thing to do with me

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Yeah

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Wendy's when Wendy's on

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Just I think for us to have a goal at first.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I I think that it's good for us to practice using each other's Expertise and just trust that you know, having having a first pass, just take some noise out of your world and it's work, that Wendy and I are sort of uniquely, prepared for I would say so it's not a done deal.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It's just a first pass, and then you'd have more to to contribute.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I think, at that point

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
You're still with it. Yeah, there, you go.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Okay. So, okay, that sounds that sounds perfect With DM, do you have

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I'm I I was gonna say whatever since Wendy has I think cause she knows the work that needs to be done.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Okay.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Okay, perfect, so so sorry, since you guys have offered to work together to kinda look at what that process would look like, Wendy and I think in in light of what you, are doing, it's like, super were to this, timing, for you guys to connect on that too.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Yeah

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Great yeah.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Yeah

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So if you if you guys, if you guys take the past through that, then I would love to we can then have a 3 or more way dialogue to to look at that, than we'll get the survey out in december before we start and then we'll, we'll follow the process through and that would

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Be kind of the first time that you know Wendy, we can wendy, and we could look at how that is. Reflected with your work as well in 10

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Yeah

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Yeah, and and so I'm Co design is actually important, if you want questions, to be meaningful to people, so it's probably more about Us.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Designing process to make sure that we've got something that is meaningful to the people you want to respond to so when we talked, about you know a larger session it might be that we do actually invite people to contribute to what that looks like having got an agreed process in some basic

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Okay.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
directions. so it's probably 2 or 3 stages that we're looking at. But we'll find some time hopefully wendy in to do that shortly

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Who who would? Is there anybody else on the call that would like to be involved in the session where Wendy Or an e show what they came up with and they present out, we can do that 3.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Way, or if anybody else would like to be included, Bill would, like to be included great

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I'd like to invite Michael

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Yes.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Is that is that acceptance. Michael, okay, so so Bill Wendy Michael Jordan, Wendy. Okay, that's fine

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Yeah, this was yeah, Switzerland, and it's got quite expertise. They're very excellent insights

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Okay, great, so, we have the Bill, Wendy, Wendy, Michael and Jordan.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
That's 5 of us Did I miss any Hands?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Or is that a good good group to handle that task

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Okay, perfect so that that's fantastic. I'm really, really excited really really grateful about that that will wendy E, I'm really really excited to have our first kind of live experiment.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We can run with us. So fantastic, okay, we'll go to we'll go to bill then i'm, gonna try to close this session, and then I I want to get into our session.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
On. Well, if there's nothing more there. So Bill Welcome

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Hey, I appreciate the opportunity to see how this entire project is seen by people who have been coming to a friend, their viewpoints and have learned along the way.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yeah

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And I think, this is especially valuable to you Jordan, that you can turn this loose and let people interpret it and I think I think there's treasurer now, I'm looking forward, to hearing that perspective, and I and I'm available for questions answered along and any point along

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The way. And then this little group, that will group, then do a review process.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But I I just wanted to echo how much I like this process

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
That's all

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Okay. Beautiful. Well, that's great. So we have some good, group wisdom on that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Okay, any objection, so we've we've set our agenda for January, February March basically, which is fantastic.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And I I expect that week by week as we go through this we'll see green shoots popping out of everything that's fall into the ground and Fall and new Lights, starting to emerge so we've got our Plan, for the New Year we've got our time for the new

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Year we've got are uniquely equipped, Wendy.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And Wendy, creating the story, narrative process with a group of 5 to review that, and then get that out and December, so those are some amazing concrete, steps, that I'm really Looking Forward to Any other Thoughts to Fold in before we Switch to our special Session on flow to Follow

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Up on the Energy from Last Week.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Okay. Beautiful. So With that, yeah, wendy. so we last week.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:13.000
We had a social call that we were not going to record that 15 min, and we decided we should record and out of that we got into some, discussions, on presence and flow and different things that might be foundational and small groups, that will spring out of our sessions, and january

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Wendy M made the offer to in response to a question.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I asked her to consolidate some of the Research and Work.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
He's been doing on Flow, if that would be useful to the group.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:42.000
There was many people in the group who indicated they would like to see that Wendy Md, who she is followed through on that this week and yesterday, sent an amazing kind of summary, out and so anyway that's why, we are following up here today, so wendy thank you so much

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000
For the work that you've been doing on this and your work this last week to Meet, the Group's Request and Over to you

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Thanks. Jordan, yeah, so I was in flow a lot, creating the summary.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I I really enjoyed doing it. I'm going to put in the chat, the link to the mirror that I've. Created.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
So there you can see all the background. Research that I've done and everything.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Else I'm also putting in if it'll take it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I'm not sure it's gonna take it

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I'm trying to put in the image of it. I took a snapshot of the Summary because it's an image format, and for summary, I think it's too big A file.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Yeah, okay, so i'm gonna share my screen. And we're gonna do it.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
That way. Oh, can you enable screen sharing please, stored in

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And whenndy e do you see the link. Now I just put it in. It's right above your comment.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Wow, yeah, we do. You were doing as I was talking.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we crossed, we crossed

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Awesome. Thank you.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And Wendy, just as you start doing this, know that I actually wrote neuroscience papers for someone who's an expert on this subject, published.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Stephen, cotler. Right you did

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Oh, well, I've I've I've I'm familiar with Steam Copper's work, but also a colleague, in Snape, and Mike weeks from the States who Work with the Us, Army and Such on flow and Resilience Internationally So actually Helped Rod Science New

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Awesome.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
assignment papers about that for a couple of for a good sort of for 6 months, at one stage, so it's an area that I know quite a lot.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
About, so my

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Good, please please pipe up when you feel like kids, it's important to do so.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And or if you feel like i'm misrepresenting, or any of that

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:49.000
So really, my might goal here, my interest in flow is around the conditions for Human Thriving.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:24:03.000
The conditions for human Flourishing the Conditions for Optimal Human performance, the reason why that's becoming such a catalytic force is because it seems to be at the center point of a lot of the Conversations.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
That I'm a part of including the one that we had last week.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Which is how can we get people working together better, how can we get people into you know, when we talk about engagement, motivation, to be involved in projects it comes stems from a lot of this and there was another thing I wanted to say in introducing this the agency also people having individual

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Agency and where their passions come from. So I think it's all I learned flow 7 or 8 years ago.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
But so much has happened as Wendy E was just saying about the the neurology, and the chemicals in the body.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000
They've learned so much more that now it's starting to come out of this place of individual performance into group, performance.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And so I think it's really in a spot. Now, this research is really in a spot.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now where we can learn from it, for the benefit of these of these things.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So I'm going to give you a quick overview.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Most of what's here I parroted straight from Steven Cotler's Work.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I have not layered on much else. Yet this is just merging 3, or 4, Ted talks of his, and then summarizing in a way that I thought would be helpful so on the left or Conditions for Flow the fact that we know flow can be learned the fact that just basic things contribute

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:44.000
To flow, like Sleeping Well, and eating Well and and Drinking water and getting some basic exercise, and then we get into how to set the stage for Flow, which includes all these conditions that I will cover in a Minute But Primarily It's, about being fully Present that is one of the Main Precautions.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So when we talk about deeply listening to each other, that's being in the deep.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Now putting our full focus on something that's a big part of setting the Stage.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Hmm.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
What the science shows is that we're hardwired for flow.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So we have it activates 5 performance enhancing neurochemicals in the brain.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
And I bet wendy could add more to this, but the is a list of all the things that it does, and again, some of the States that we're desiring when we come together and work in collaboration.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Our reparation are represented in how the science, what this what the science is showing.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:29.000
We know, happens in the brain for a from a chemical standpoint, this is what people report basically flow feels flowy.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
But this is all the things that happen in all different disciplines.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And then the reason why it's working. Even talking. About this, is it's self perpetuating.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Because this brings about all the 5 neurochemicals in the brain that are pleasure related we as soon as we get a little bit of this.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:27:03.000
We want more of it, and so in terms of motivation and keeping people engaged it's it's a key component of it, and then it also has all these benefits in our life, it makes creative decision-making.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Near Perfect High speed. It's 5 times more productive, it works.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So you could work one day if you were in flow, 100% of the time, which is a question, and of itself.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:28.000
But let's just wave a magic one, and if you're flow 100% of the time you could work one day and be just as productive as working 5 days, not in flow, more innovative, innovative, with the ability to detect new patterns over long Periods of time, so a lot of the work, that

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:46.000
We're doing together is in this emergent inception, spaces for us to be able to see patterns being in flow makes it much much easier being innovative from the creative associations, that we make from those unknown and on unseen places is part of this process as well, it's highly

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
enhanced from being in flow, athletic Performance, as a side benefit.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:09.000
It repeatedly allows us to push our boundaries. Reduces Depression and Anxiety, that's gonna be more and more, important as time goes on and the World Feels More and more, Chaos and We because the prefrontal Cortex is is is Deactivated we literally get out of

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Our own way the Inner Critic Dies, the nervous System Resets, We're more in Parasympathetic Nervous, System, Theta, State and we tend to have a Sense of Freedom

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Basically, when we come together to do this work, or even if we have one brilliant press person Pushing Forward, we can create Situations that Benefit, all of humanity, like creating Paradigm shifts, never seen before Impossible, Achievements, Dreaming, up full Visions, for the future Worldchanging Businesses in record

00:28:44.000 --> 00:29:02.000
time, on and on, okay, so that gives you basically the overview the part, I'm gonna bring our attention to now and then I'll stop for thoughts and we can dive back into parts that you think, are most interesting, or you want to talk about but first, I wanna talk about group flow I just wanna list, this was just a list that

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
was provided and so I took it verbatim triggers are those things that are the preconditions.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So this is basically just a summary of all the things that I just shared, which is complete concentration, equal participation.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So checking egos at the Door, and Agendas at the Door, and doing something together, that may have nothing to do with my personal Ego close, listening which which helps with the deep now familiarity, with each other which is back to the Connections open communication, with each other Shared, goal, Shared.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Risk, encouraging. Yes, and so we stay in that space of out of the Out of the prefrontal judging cortex and into areas where we're being more playful autonomy, and sense of Control I have Choice, about where I'm going to go next all of this I just Want, to put

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:03.000
One cap on it a lot of things that were happening this year and Meta Project, a lot of people had pieces.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:17.000
They wanted to contribute, a lot of people had things that they wanted to say and it was hard for us to find a rhythm in order, for that to happen one of the other things that's optimal for flow is this constant sense, of feedback Loop that I know I'm on the right

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Track, otherwise, the engagement dies pretty quickly. So I just want to throw that piece in here, too.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:40.000
That was another big piece in the research, which was showing how feedback even even if it's Possible Immediate Feedback, becomes a critical component to staying in the Now and being continually motivated and I think how that translates to group Formation and group, work, is that We're, giving each other either

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Just appropriation can be a kind of feedback with each other.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000
But it can morph, into. Hey, I'm gonna I we love your Project but Let's put it on a put put it later, we're gonna come back to it in a month.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Just even something simple, like that means that people feel, heard and seen.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And there, and it gives them the feedback. That they're in the right place and to keep engaging.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Yes, okay. Yeah, wendy, you should have access. Now.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Hmm.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
It's beautiful when you thank you

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
So, Wendy. I'm curious about what you've read around Steven call this work because it's it's pretty solid, I mean, he's Summarizing.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:33.000
So that's a quick overview. I'm gonna stop sharing. And we'll have a little discussion, and then we can dive back in If people find that a value thanks

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:53.000
It really? Well, there are a lot of other people who talk about flow and Jason's just talked about one as a resource that I think it might be interesting to understand what some other views, because the science, is pretty Compelling and I mean even Crosses over to the conversation, this is another a couple of books.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Called stealing fire I think it is which is one's talking about how religion, and spirituality and flow.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Or very very similar, which is a really good, thing, because otherwise we're out for a very rough rocky ride, the the fact that you can show that this is a similarity between those 2 things means, you can approach the challenges that we have from multiple directions and still use a process that you could actually 9

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
But Jason, you said you've got a resource, and I've got one, too, from the work that I've done.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And I'm curious about Jason and I'm also curious about your other reading.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So now I'm a bit hung

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Yeah, John, John Lenhart, I I held a bunch of

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Okay. Conferences in the area where I brought people from across the nation to explore, how do you build a skill?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And then explore ultimately, what turn into generativity. And how do you how do?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:58.000
You help people flourish, using their uniqueness, and so John Lenhart has done a bunch of work.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Related to Uniqueness, and how Uniqueness Drives how Individual Uniqueness then actually drives the way different people flow that there's different flow patterns that happen for people depending on who they are and there are definitely flow disruptors, as as a matter, of fact and his a lot, of

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
His work. It's like normally, all the people you know you know how to push their buttons, which is totally their flow disruptor, what we tend not to do.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Well is actually the opposite, which is enable, enable, the the flow that people have and so he's not a bunch of work in schools, he's done work all over he is based in florida, now and he is He's like umami so He's, a Acquired.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Taste. But I think it it'd be interesting to connect him in maybe to this group, once or something or connect them, to some people and just we have a couple of conversations I think, he would plan that best name

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Hmm! Can I just encourage you to to share what resources you've got with me and anybody else, and I'm pretty good at consuming those things, because I'd like to integrate them a little bit and I agree with you all about the uniqueness, because quite often you know, the checking ego at the

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
doorbeat, is the Problematic part, because once you start differentiating yourself, then it has to go your way.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Then you do take you're naturally taking people out of a collective flow.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:49.000
State you have to spend quite a lot of time getting into some sort of correct regulated spite, and getting used to getting into a co-regulated space with all the differences and if you can do that regulating quickly, then you can get into a flow, stack quite quickly, and work efficiently, so dealing

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
With unique. And it goes is like key.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And just. I'll make one last quick, comment, but so he took.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I went through all of This Courses Type Stuff and when we did that a few years back, I connected him to Ross, Akop's work.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And so a lot of his work is around is now based Off of A Coughs.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
I. I had a chance to work with Aka about 20 some years ago, and so it's about Kind of dissolving problems.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Right Not not attacking or solving, but it gets back to some of the Complex and the Active stuff, too.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
But it's dissolving or dissolving right.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:39.000
So not going in the direction of the problem. But going away from the problem can normally can, in a slow state, actually solve the problem, or address, the problem, depending on what words, use

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:50.000
There's something really important and merchant about this idea Jason, if you could.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:08.000
If you could drop that spelling and reference, and I'm taking notes, and Hack, Md but I drop the reference to press they copied off whatever that name was that'd be great There's something really interesting and important to this differentiation to that Feels like

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:30.000
it's critical to this moment in history, which is that a lot of this workaround let's say personal transformation, or flow or these different these different things, that kind of fit together, like so let's say there's this Workaround personal Transformation, say, this Workaround Flow Let's say, that

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Wendy was right, and hypothesizing that the Workaround flow and Spirituality, and religion are made to be connected, and so you're getting towards this idea of deep personal transformation and connection with that most Transcendent and deepest things that can inform how we manage ourselves, in the world and and how we

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000
manifest ourselves in the world, in a way that's aligned with the people around us, and our families and communities, and societies.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And we start to stack up and align all those different different ways of being so Wendy mentioned that that there's this maybe edge this learning edge of this work on low or Transformation, right now, kilo welcome thank you for you said you wouldn't, be here, today.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Because you are so busy. So it's wonderful to see the grace of sun shining on you, and you being present, thank you

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Yeah

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Ruth Canal was busy but Stunned probably won't make sense and my math is droopy.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
But it's such a good topic. So very glad to be.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Here i'll be, and by any way.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Yeah, thank you. Thank you. We're we're glad to have you here.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Praying, healing, so there's a interesting, maybe, edge, or the like the edge of where this is right?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Now where a lot of this research came out over the last section of years, and we are learning how to do it individually and then as we get into flow.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Something really interesting happens experientially and I I guess I won't say that objectively.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I'll save for me. What happens is the more I get into flow.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
The more I find myself called and compelled to do things that I are impossible to do alone.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And because I realize that what I can do alone is is lacking, and that I need to be able to take my world and stack up and align it with other worlds.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And other projects that are also in the station, state of Quote, and then the more of those you start connecting with the more you kind of realize, okay, there's.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:42.000
There are millions of people around the world drinking from the same source, so to speak, getting prompted in the same ways, and so wendy.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000
I think you mentioned this edge, where some of the Resource research is starting to transition from you?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Know? How can we be in an individual Flow state to account our own ends as best we understand that which is which is good and limited?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000
To how can we collectively achieve low states that allow us to be far more wise.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Far, more discerning, far more powerful, far, more capable, far more impactful than any of us can be in isolation.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:26.000
So the group can accept or reject that direction. But I would I would love to have some discussion on that leading Edge of group flow dynamics.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And and how that is similar to or different than I'm what we've done on individual proteinics

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Wendy, what I've read, and I'm assuming you read most of Stephen's books.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:04.000
But the ones where he and this actually fits him with a lot of the other research that I fred is that you have to there's a co-regulation thing that when you've looked after yourself, well, enough you're receptive to be able to practice, getting into flow with other people and

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
It needs it can be done, that's almost instantaneous.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Once you've done enough of the pre work, but it's the pre work is not something that you can skip, and it's what I sensed happened in this group most over this year is, we sort.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Of learned how to get into that co-regulated space.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
We have longer meetings, we can't. We can actually just drop into it.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Now, I think but doing it with strangers is difficult, because when somebody new comes in and they haven't got that background and I know i'm pretty confident that this is what we infinity is doing.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And I've seen, it in other places. As well, certainly with clean language.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:58.000
So this is sort of agreement, the agenda that you've got to spend the time getting ready to be out to co-regulate and though it happens magically, sometimes at festivals and I mean ask and other places, but then you leave it and you can only find it when you go back

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:17.000
To that group of people in that activity to plan to to do something together with a group of strangers, you sort of need to come prepared and we we learned our way into doing it, over the year is that, naming it we learn how to do it

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Like to queue, who's been speaking to that as a really emergent thing like we, it's almost like you taste something you you said wendy we get into spaces where it magically, occurs and there's.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Something so clearly, this really experienceially in every way different than other places.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000
We're in. And then the idea is, okay, that could be this ephemeral thing that can only occasionally happen.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Magically, and I think what Wendy E. And Wendy M.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And Gil and others are advocating for is no, that's actually a very concrete experiential reality that we can learn to experience on more and more like let's say that that's one or 2% of our experience, of our week now, it's like maybe we can expand that to

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:20.000
3 or 4%, or maybe 10%. And so it's like a concrete thing that can be experienced more and more, often as a skill that we get good at and maybe it's, we could get really, good.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:39.000
At that skill that's like the difference between cutting hundreds of years, off of our Path of Development, as a human species because we can we can skip some of these levels to a high higher state of wisdom or Understanding, or Experience, whatever those things, are wendy

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Yeah

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Yeah, so. Oh, and I'm putting in here, too, just very quickly.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
And you can find flow in other things that are not helpful.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
You know, like Drugs and alcohol and things like that and the things that feel, like flow that aren't and so part of the part of the Challenge.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I think is to to not let people. Just find it serendipitously, but give them an experience that they know that they could deliberately drop into that was healthy because it's very easy just to run run away to the other ones or just escape in art or escaping something else and isn't

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
working with other people.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Love, it when Wendy and Thanks Wendy.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Yeah, so, yeah, I, this, is so rich, I I haven't read his books interestingly enough, I tend to be a person who skips across.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:46.000
A bunch of stuff in an effort to weave the bigger picture together, so I really appreciate the Deeper Dives that people have on this call into some of the Research, and to More Depth and I think it's, would be nice to to sense, together, where this could Go next I am Happy to do continued Research, and

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I am open to people saying, if we want to understand, and I think particularly group group coherence and group flow.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
These are the next you know people. We want, maybe we want to have another discussion.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
If people already have the expertise or send me on a journey of research, and I'm Happy to do that, and add to it.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And come back I will continue pursuing this line of questioning.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Anyway, because it's something. That is speaking so much in all the conversations that I'm having that everybody's looking for these conditions, so the more I can codify it the more I will and then There'll be a place, of We are Sensing into It's it's a learning Edge, and We Haven't

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
found an expert, yet or we haven't found an experience yet that's informing us.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And we will help to shape it together as we go forward, but I'm trying to mind what's out there as much as we can.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:52.000
And you said it beautifully, Jordan, so that we're not saying, oh, this happens magically, but we're starting to realize that we can create the conditions, just to add a little bit on that and to enter and to Tack, in and to tie into what wendy was mentioning before about

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Spirituality and religion. I. I do believe that because the body has habitual and because we're talking about brain waves, and and neurochemistry there is a we will probably find that there is a series of things, that.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:27.000
We can do at the beginning of meetings, that's adds to what Jordan already has in terms of just meditative time, that helps to ground people into the now and makes them feel present and connected to the other people in the room that helps prepare us for the flow State that we are going to

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Experience together. and so that just makes me think of religion. And how there's a ritual around things, and their ceremony around things and I think, Indigenous Wisdom also has a lot to say, about this and a lot, to offer into this Space as well, thanks

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:55.000
That comment of intentionally preparing for what we're going to experience together, that's that's a alright thanks.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Wendy

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Thank you, I feel a little self, conscious since I missed most meeting and you know, when I joined I can.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I cannot speak very well. If I just had the Central Procedure right, then, and my tongue is sick, but it's too exciting.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
And so wendy Wendy said, most of what I was going to say so I'll just say what's left actually both weddings.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000
So one, is the co-regulation, the importance of that and the

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:47.000
The specific techniques and methods with which we can elicit those as well, as you know, tricks and methods, from other places, that we can do that from sorry can't talk, and then the value of that contribution, to other groups, and to other people, and if we were to do what do jordan

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
have suggested with you which is go and ask other people.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Other groups? What is it that you need, and then also observe.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:03.000
You know, they may not know that, but we may see that as we listen to them expressing whatever they are expressing, you know see, what is emerging, then kind of put those things together, one thing is what emerges.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:14.000
In our group, or any groups, we engage another one, what emerges if we tried to bring this kind of coherence.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Outside and the third related aspect. It's just Hmm

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Bring, that intention, even more intentionally into the world for our speaking, or maybe writing, or you know, whatever we do.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:39.000
This is one thing, but the experts have studied and have done, and they know that's wonderful.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And we can read their stuff and learn from it. It's another one.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
What we practically are doing. Because there's actually value in what we are doing.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:48:06.000
For what we are trying to do and we know there's valley, because we go and talk to other people in other places, and we're recognize it's a valid to that but beyond that we also create that value literally by articulating it literally by saying here, has been our experience, this is what it looks

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Like and in some ways to draw parallels to the Lucille Foundation's Holistic, Business Training, which just do they have those Launch and launch, their you know, Website, for the work of good, living vision for Good, Living

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Just by articulating. Here's a process where we're in this is why we're doing this.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Is what we're doing. This is how we're doing all of a sudden.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
It brings it to another level, that many other people can then relate to connect to build, from and we have enough to do that.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:49:08.000
And Going Forward, especially as we engage with others, and we keep bringing that which both Wendy's were speaking of than Jordan, you spoke and you know, like like all these different Aspects are actually coming together, they will probably come together, in the next action, more concrete ways, as we engage and then as we kind

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Yeah

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Good! Or I'm just gonna comment there less than a minute.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And then go to you, Kilo, there's something so critical about what you said and it's reflected in so many of our conversations with this idea of it's like we're we're trying to progressively realize or bring in to reality some kind of a way of being together, That's at the edge

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Of our ability to understand and articulate much less like articulate.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:10.000
It well, much less embody it occasionally must much less embody it, like all the time, as our primary Way of Being, so every one of those Steps, is a gift, right it's like if you're not conscious, and you sent something but you can't see it and you just got back from Marie

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Canal, so you don't know how to speak it, and you know Blah blah blah, but there's like some things, you just speak something that's such a, gift because it Brings it one step closer like out of the the realm, into reality.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And then if other people can, you know comment and engage and that's kind of maybe where we're getting on this group, well, with other people, can comment and build on it it's like then you can look back at the Transcript of the meeting and see how because you, with your droopy mouth said something that

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Was approximately true, the Best you Could, and then other people built on it all of a sudden we have a 5 min conversation that approximately paints a picture of something that previously had no Words and was only an image in some of our Minds, that Body, of Work, then Creates, the the Chance for it to become more and

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
More real over time, right. Maybe even get eventually getting into like process.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:11.000
That groups can get trained in to like and even if those things are at the edge of Milling, so that that's okay, not for that.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
So thank you so much for being really valuable. Eric.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Yeah, I would like to bring something in like, all right, beginning of the meeting somewhere, the to concept of flow was introduced, and the more I listen to more, I understood, yeah.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:46.000
What I like about it is that it's positive as a language flow, as a concept, it has a lot of things in it that are really positive and and balanced.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:58.000
So it's it's a could say that it's a dynamic approach to how how we can work together as a group, or you can find your own wisdom.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:07.000
How are you balanced your boundaries? So you don't do too much, and you don't do too little so there's and and I like it.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:15.000
That it's so positive, and I I am thinking about this idea and it's an example, but it's a very deep one.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:24.000
And it exists in the one like. The word trauma for me is a is a negative word trauma is a word that has a happy load.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
To it. it sounds a bit like. I don't know.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Cancer is also this kind of word, where if I just, hear the word cancer, I get jolted.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
And I'm trying to find the words and the pictures and the images of the positive side to it.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000
And I I remember, for instance, this one hypnot therapist.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
I don't know if I talked about it in this group.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:12.000
He uses really positive, inventory. As well, like a grain with a blade of grass, in the desert, or some thing is one of the Titles of his books, about giving hope to very desperate places and there's something about the kind of hope and the Positivity that goes

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
To the Deepest Level and I really acknowledges also the depths of it like one image.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
I get is. Like if if you want to transport a tree, you it's not easy.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Because you've got all these roots in the ground.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:48.000
And you really need to capture around the roots and get the you get the 3 yard, and actually machine with that Gotcha they're like very broadly, it's like in the broadly, underage, from a plate, has been do more Healthy, stuff as an example, of we transform also.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:00.000
The language.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Yeah

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:22.000
No positively, how do we turn it into something that's helpful for us, to face we're wanting to face like active hope I think is also an example it's active hope is really about looking at see and and facing it, and looking at it and and saying, okay, let what can we do.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Now if you if you never can do enough. What, then, like asking these really difficult questions, but from a positive place, and I think that's also from the mental in in the group, and how we approach things.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Is we go to these depot levels. It's not like shining, a bright or a light, and everything will be final.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
It's really going to the depth and really understanding it and Steve is sharp, and it's deepest identity.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:54.000
And then gradually, making a problem. Search in language is one thing, but also an approach to.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000
To the energy we put into things, and how we same, thing that it becomes more positive

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
The also in the Deepest place and stuff. I think a lot in the past.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:24.000
And I what I learned over the weeks and months is yeah, let's also frame it in a positive way, so we we don't have to be told that in this deep, dark place alone, but also, already reaching by talking of reaching to the positive place by talking about it

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Yeah

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Thanks, thanks. Eric, yeah, when Wendy M, I feel like, that matches, a lot of your intuition around this as well.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Absolutely. Yeah, thank you.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, e. I see your lips moving and you're on Mute.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Sorry I jumped in

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
So just putting it out there, boilotto's book deviate is brilliant absolutely about sensors, and what I was listening to?

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
And I know is to be true from my neuroscience background, and know that I have actually worked in neuroscience, neurology.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
And heading, injuries and things like that. So I've got quite deep experience here in the practical sense is that when you've got a slightly lower mood state, because of uncertainty.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
It makes you more alive to your senses, which is where change comes from.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And this is critical, so positive, a positive mindset can actually the and this is not at all to say what you just said, Eric, is not useful because what is possible is the best question to ask.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
You in any situation. But if you come in with a slightly discombobulated Stance, Point where your you're not feeling necessarily you're succeeding but you're not necessarily feeling that your failing your senses become more alive, and you will then take you more of the environment, and be more present

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
To it. So there is actually value in the slight negative or the slight, the definite uncertainty which for many people, since humans, absolutely crave certainty, and control We're Wired to to find that sense, of control and what you have to be is just that tiny Bit out of Control all of the time and

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
That will keep you most aware of everything. That's going on.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
That's right

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
You and and paradoxically, even though that feels negative, potentially, if you can just make that state of being in slight disarray, your normal, state, then you will have more information, and you will actually, make more progress together, but it's just enough, disarray so I can emphasize name but

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Mahali to to Sink Mahali.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
One of these days, I'll practice. Yeah, thank you, and it's the same twice.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:25.000
You know, one of the preconditions for flow is this,

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Yeah

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
This not knowing is actually really critical, and not knowing is deeply uncomfortable.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
And you've got to get comfortable with being on comfortable, and that is isn't necessarily a positive state until we flip it.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
And it has to be just the right level of difficulty.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
For you to survive, that, to be clear that the thing that's coming at you isn't actually going to kill you, although it might so it's a game.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
It could kill you, that you know that hamburger looks like it's coming at you, very slowly, and very peopleing form.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:42.000
But literally, it can be the thing that knocks you over so it's a game about being comfortable with uncertainty and keeping your senses alive and I can't I can't raise that book, that sorry highly enough is really readable and it's.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Yeah

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
The Starting Point, the Census of the Starting Point, and Uncertainty, and Just hang with the Uncertainty, and going through the whole Chemical, Yuck.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Yeah, it's it's it's a tricky.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
What we got.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:27.000
So I wanna add to that just to clarify like for me, it's not about talking, about the positive, and always really really the positive, it's also about being the negativity in a positive way, like like looking into the Sun is this book, about and it's about death.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:35.000
It's about a positive way of framing. What what is what is the positive thing about looking at this together?

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:43.000
What can you what is the healing aspect of that what is the the recovering aspect of it or in process?

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Work, it's meeting them, most Heavy aggression and and meeting the the fact that maybe some people killed each other, each Other's Family, even then but meeting with a sense of reconciliation, of Healing.

00:59:44.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Hmm.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Of remediation, absolutely horrifying parts, also of What's Happening.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
But you, transform it and you transmute it into something positive because it creates a sense of community.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And yeah, since steps of pain. And it's not, it's tricky.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It. It can become, of course, this kind of forced healing, which is not bill, healing and and spiritual bypassing and all of that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But it's really that's, not that's. That's one of the traps. I hope I meet you there

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, beautiful. There. Just a quick anecdote, that

01:00:39.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It's just another way to reinforce what what Wendy was saying in my in my martial arts training, like that's a call, my mythical teacher, always asked the question like what's the right amount of fear you should have even as you get more and more competent.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Right. So it's like you're. You're being confronted with, an an unknown force of unknown malevolence.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And unknown capacity to kill you and how? Afraid of that?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Should you be versus how old courageous exploration, you know. And so there's always this idea that if you don't retain

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
If you're too fearful, you're paralyzed!

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You're dead, you're done, and if you're too confident, you're dead from your arrogance and pride, right, and so you'd have to have this reserve of the deepest, confidence, and knowing and the the knowing of what you're, being even beyond death, so that you're not afraid

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:59.000
to die, right and this 1, one, or 2, on the Scale of 10, Level of Fear, or Negativity, or whatever that is, that's keeping you honest and causing you to perceive and be aware and and Heightened to the Solutions that could Emerge, it feels, like that same kind of thing where

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:07.000
it's like on a scale of 0. To 10. You'd have to kind of set that level of negativity, and set it at an appropriate level.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So your Bolt Courageous Competent and moving into the Unknown with with the Courage and conviction, and not so Arrogant that you're immediately dead so there's like that little edge. So I Don't know if that I think That's approximately there okay, Morgan

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I really like this Topic written a few bullets, answering the Question Permanently

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:47.000
If a group is in a flow state, as a group, what does that look like here's I guess I came up with about 10 I'll try to keep it.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Brief but some of these I mean our 3 h, long conversations potentially, but the first thing that came to mind was collocation, a group in a flow state generally is located.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Next to one another, in the same general space, or at least periodically, we share or Us.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
This is seen as aetically as an island of light

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I also see, live Collaboration like where We're doing now, I also see asynchronous reporting and communications.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
There's a technical stack. That's probably worth dissecting there.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But I see iterative, planning cycles.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I see, hierarchical multivariate optimization.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:00.000
To help us, tune into one, another, and our ultimate objectives, I see Project open, Project, roles, that play to individual strengths.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I see Love Born and Consensus Driven Objectives.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I see shared positive experiences is he genuine curiosity, relationships

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I see, grounding and Shared Vibration and intention, and I see Co.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Creative expression, and feedback, which kind of overlap with a lot of lot of the Sentiment We've been Hearing.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So that's that's what comes to mind in responding to that original question

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It was beautiful morning, thank you! That was really. well, articulated.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Thank you.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:03.000
There's there's a piece. I don't know if we'll get to today, or not and the remaining 19 min but on this feedback element, wendy, M, and I had a Conversation on this Morning but There's this Generative, Co.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Creative side and expression, and then earlier, Wendy expressed that over our last months, together, many times, as We generated really cool create an Express, we then sense a void that doesn't allow Us to properly, co-create, or get the Energy, Moves, back or whatever that is Right it

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Doesn't allow us to self-regulate correct and redirect, our energy towards what's what's most emergent for us altogether.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So some people in a group have been working on even technical, solutions for that. For that feedback, that would allow those cycles to start to close close quicker, so we might we might not get there, today. But it's a it's a place we should go okay, let's, go to jason.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Got a build on a couple of things, both. a Martial arts, metaphor and and what?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I think wendy e you were talking about when we we did analysis on how to build any skill.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And then also thinking about the flow to do it, and we found that

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Yeah

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Besides having something to practice. So so you need to have a method, and a practice and a code, you needed to have a challenge and that challenge had to be something that you didn't think you could do but you actually could which actually means that there's a coach necessary because the coach keeps you in the

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Zone of of moving you beyond your own belief in your capabilities.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And when you do achieve something you can't achieve just like Wendy said, that's one like not only to hit the dopamine, but hit the flow and in Toyota, Kata, is a version of that methodology which is create a challenge create a set of smaller iterative, experiments

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:21.000
To run towards your challenge, and then run your play practice your play and then have a coach that allows you to do that the interesting thing that we found was that almost everything is a quote unquote skill, from hope, to positivity, there are a few things that are not skill for example, actually

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Introversion. Extra version is not a skill, it's

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's somewhat in 8 into when a baby responds to light or away from light, and so it's not that's a that's a reaction.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
But you can change that could could change your introversion, extra room.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:08:02.000
But most things are skills and And so using that same pattern, we've been building various skills related to hope, positivity, and a model around exceptional experiences, for everyone, that allows people to create psychological safety, in a system, with the vulnerability of a person, to allow them to kind of thrive

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Beautiful.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The the other key thing of that branding is it is it changes everything.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Someone earlier mentioned this idea of the agency, that's so critical.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Like the restoration of Agency, and so, if almost Everything, as a skill and can be learned and taught, and progressed into some form, got totally restores the agency, as Opposed to if you feel like almost everything is random chance can't be influenced, like it it kind of Puts, you in this

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The holly chicks. Me! Hi, it's fix fixing me. Hi, yeah.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Victimized state of running from the Catastrophe or meta crisis at hand as opposed to courageously facing into it, and learning skills and increasing manner to gradually confronted overcome it which seems to be the better the better Pattern wendy again.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yes, so just to pull on that thread. A little bit more.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I love bringing in the Research, when it's patterning what people are speaking out from experience because for me, it's about adding to the pattern and saying, oh, yes, this has been discovered Somewhere Else and It confirms it and so I just not that we all have to go run and look at the

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Research but I just want to speak here that the all the Research, from Carol, Dwck, growth, mindset.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Is what we were just referring to there too, and that character strength does a big piece of this, because provides people language of appreciation, and positivity and recognizing what your Strengths are and Patterning out.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Values that are app that are actionable and so it gives you a sense of control, so that fits into here as well and I feel like there was one more in there somewhere, as well, but it all it's all really interrelated and it's it's what I've been looking at for

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The last 10 years, and I keep kind of dancing around these things.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And for me these moments in these conversations and other similar ones, I'm having is is finally the chance to merge, all of these points of View, Perspectives Backgrounds in Research and Insights, into something technological That's what you were just talking about Jason that can help Support people towards their best

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Self. And I just think that kind of stuff is super exciting.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And if we can do any of that work together, that would be like heaven for me, so I wanted to say that it also really likes to at wendy, e, your saying a while back about the unknown, and the uncertainty but combining that and combining that with what Eric was saying about the

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
positivity. It made me also say another way to say that.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
That I. Practice in my life. Is a sense of trying to always be an a curiosity and wonder.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Space, because it's a to me. It's the precursor to a crisis, right if I can avert the crisis, it's because I've been curious about something coming at me, long before it reaches, Me and I'm listening to it with a deep awareness, now does that always save me

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
from something. No, of course, not it's life, but I have found that being in a space of curiosity and wonder, allows me to go go with the flow a lot better so to me it's the echo of the same thing when we come together, as a group, being comfortable with the unknown I think is one

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
way to say it, and being curious is another way to say it, and then the last thing.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I wanted to say is this whole concept around Chicksimi highs, original insights into flow where we are on our learning edge.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I I'm using the term learning edge, where we are challenged.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Just enough. But not overwhelmed, and that was kind of his first discovery, that he contributed and kind of was the Grandfather of Flow, and that's a good thing to remember as we invite other people, into our group when we keep talking about Onboarding Well It's it's

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Helping them, walk, that edge, walking, their learning edge, not what we want to teach them.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But what did they want to learn, and how quickly do they want to learn.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It so we don't overwhelm them, and we keep them challenged by the thing that's interesting them.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And it's Definitely squarely in the and the Camp of Education.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I'm sure we all have examples of how that hasn't gone well, so, and where and times when it did go.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:38.000
That's such a deep when I reflect back that that's one of the deepest challenges with with the concepts we've been engaged in over the last over the last Couple of quarters, is that if a Group of People, comes together around the Highest of Let's say the Meta-crisis and

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:57.000
the Meta Project, and that opportunity, whatever the highest level of what We're grappling with as a human species, and what the Opportunities and Challenges are that is entirely overwhelming for every One, of Us, as Individuals Right every One of us Faces into the absolute, greatest extent of what the Problems and

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Opportunities are that are at hand, and then you know is tempted to run away, and pull the covers over ahead and buy it.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And if if we collectively do that then we're we're living in the wrong manner right, so it's like, and I think that's why we realize we can't do, it alone, right because each of us has a unique, learning edge each of us.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Has a unique capacity to hold some portion of this, and it we're, looking into a challenge that We're petrified by and it turns Us to Stone and We're frozen and We can't do.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Anything, and we fall into anxiety and depression, and that's not the right level of challenge for us, and for us, as a community we need to tackle that right so it's like okay, how do we get each of us, situated into the right learning edge let's, just use, that word, the

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:58.000
right level of challenge that we can help one another system see that maybe make those iteratively bigger like quarter by quarters, so that each of us is growing towards our potential which I think we would all like to do and we would all like to help one another do but then this idea of how we create the

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:16.000
conceptual space, to hold the highest, level, challenge and opportunity of what we need to do collectively without having that precious individually, or locally, is like the that's to me, the great psychological challenge that We're up against like as We looked at the next 7 Years I said like too much in that and I

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000
actually heard myself doing it. I'm gonna self correct there Bill

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I liked what Wendy M. Said about curiosity and wonder and

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I've been thinking here about where I've seen the flow State developed in my own life, and one of the earliest places I saw is as a I was old as a 5 children and the Youngest 2 I was very close to like I because I was much older than them and I was almost like a father

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Figure I would engaged with them at the earliest stages, you know, changing their diapers, and babysitting them, taking a on their ventures, and teaching them things and with my own children, the same thing, and i've observed this, about flow, in my own life, and what i've seen in

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Others. It requires some kind of common recognition and language, and trust that we're going to be in a group in the flow state to a certain extent, but little children may not have much equipment in the Area of language yet and even a child that can't speak i've noticed

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That it's possible to get in a wonderful flow state with a little child communicating.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And here's how I saw it? Happening you know, done this a lot with my kids when they're real little.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:16:09.000
You make eye contact with a child, show interest, in them. Listen carefully, with a happy expression, and then find an object, and then say a word about the object, and then let them just let that sink in yeah, not not a lot, of work, is the word, and then say it again, and then see it again, and they begin to see it and

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:31.000
They recognize that there's something happening, here and their their minds are in such a plastic state of synapse strengthening as they are culturally imprinted and linguistically imprinted that they are wired to Grab onto words, and to connect and so It's

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Just amazing to me over the years, to watch children learn you, if you if you are close and pay attention.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Which anyone who's a parent is looked in their child's eyes, and taught them a word, you understand how it's just the you you're, you're drawn into that flow state with them because their intensity and their curiosity and hunger is so great and so to apply this

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:13.000
From what Wendy is saying. If if I if I take this lesson to myself, or what I've seen in children what I just heard Wendy say, if I'm Interested and Curious enough and People know I'm interested to talk with them, and I'm listening carefully and I'm

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm attentive to what's happening that has a tendency to draw them into wanting to connect that same way.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But if I'm just waiting for an opportunity to say, you know, get my piece in. You know.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Just wait. Wait, wait, say, something you know, like, so many people, doing conversations.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Then I'm not gonna draw them into a full state.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I'm gonna make them feel like I've just been waiting for an opportunity to interrupt and same my piece.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And I in little children don't have any problem with with ego, they they don't care.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
If they ask a dumb question, it's not a dumb question to them.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
You know why do dogs Poop? Why is that rock hard?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You know they don't care if they don't know something.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:18.000
They just they just want to know what. And I think this idea of returning to a child like wonder, or re rekindling, but should always be there in us, can be so encouraging to people because it creates a safe state one last little thing when I was when my daughter was 4 one day you

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Know, flurry of I can do that too? I said to her, you know what Christina, I saw a modern art painting.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Here and I think I could ping one like that. I said, well, maybe we both could paint one like that.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So I went to the Law firm where I worked, and on a Saturday with her with paints canvases you ran into the Basement Library spread everything out, and I said and I Kind of came up with this idea on the spur of them with Ron I said, we're going to do

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
We're gonna paint, the same painting together at the same time.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:58.000
You can. And the rule is, you can paint or draw anything you want and the other person can't completely.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Change it, but you you can't wipe it out, but you can change it.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Only you can add to or adjust, and at first we were anxious that hey!

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I I drew that thing, and you changed it, or I painted this thing, and you painted over that corner of it.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And so there was this early adjustment stage where we thought, hey, this is my painting, that was the first natural response.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But after a little bit, it just clicked with both of us.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
This is our painting. It's not mine, it's not yours.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
It's ours, and so we we just we just got into the state where we're almost drooling painting.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
This thing, and I've had that painting hanging in my house for years, and every time people have seen it.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
They say? Where did you get that? You know it's like you went to some modern art.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
You know, gallery, and you bought a very nice painting or something.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And I just laughed because it is the one of the best things I ever experience, in a thing in a, in a project, with another human being.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Where we both gave up all our ideas, and something that I would never have painted, and she wouldn't emerge in front of us.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
So I called it Dual Painting duel, because it starts like a dual, and it ends up dual.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Of I don't wanna call call it document, but maybe articulate you know, like we don't just leave it as an ephemeral thing, left in the Air, and then we move on but like write something think, express something share something put it some more worried lands and it will become a resource or living resource

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
You know du Al, and over the years I practice this and first time I went on a date with my wife.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I I went to her place I showed up with paint this many years. Ago.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
She wondered. What is what kind, of guy is this?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Is paints and brushes. Now she was an artist, and I didn't even know that I said we're gonna do what I call a dual Painting, and she said it was the most romantic thing she'd ever done her life.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:46.000
We ran this drooling dual, state painting, a painting, and she would tell other women about it.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That's great. Yeah.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And they go. Oh, you know. But but it's it's been a tradition in our family to do.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Dual paintings, and we've done it in with couples who are struggling and it's been an interesting mechanism.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But I I can't speak highly enough of all aspects of this flow.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:10.000
State. Because I think we are hungry to get into a State like this

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
10, s in early, before we go to Eric, yeah, couple of minutes left here,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Then we we took an improv class and that's basically the Yes, and then Prov it's like Whatever somebody lays out down.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You can't negate it you have to say, yes, and somehow build on it right?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So that that improv sounds like that's basically an improvised painting.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So it's We could. We could play with that experience on the Internet. Okay, we just have a couple of minutes here, Eric

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I just wanted to give a few, examples, because it's

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Yeah, when I hear popping up and like this, different aspects of this, like, I remember this space, is a community place and people are accepted.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
There, and there, very simple ways often of dealing with people.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And one was this guy. He had this wild look in his eyes, and you could see him run around with an axe.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:22.000
He was very active, but you could also see it was a very traumatized guy. And if you talk to him, he would be act very like, yeah, it's nasty, comments, and it would come from a very deep place.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Good! It is like this very positive person, and it's like nobody would expect this from this person to be this positive and it's and it's a very simple way to change it around or another, example.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It's like the click of Slander was a pre, a a colored, person that went there and

01:22:45.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Started talking to people from the clue, because he was in the band, playing music for them, or somehow, and then bit by bit, he learned to get their trust or there's this city, where they used in there, was a little bit of violence, in Traffic and the way, to remediate it, is they put

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
it instead of Normal traffic agents in this quite big city.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:28.000
They Put Clowns, and then Change the Atmosphere completely, and Violence went down drastically and I also remember a moment.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Where I I could see this person not being met in her the despair, and not being able to heal and change, and I was able to name, the negative very precisely, and it made her shift as well and it's that's another part it's like you really have to be Precise and meet and

01:23:46.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Really recognize the person, and and I was doing it in a way that normally would say, is irritating like I was repeating like, okay, you could do this again, and can and again, and again, but I was chilling into with their energy, and it was correct for their energy, they really thank me, for it after

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Because it really liberated them from the sense of being completely stuck for years and years, and not being met there, and people that are and that are not reachable.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:20.000
They they require something precise, also, 90, first, like Richard Schwartz.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:30.000
He worked with the people, that everybody vote, of people that committed the worst offenses, but they he helped them heal and recover. And become yeah.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Good like people contributing to society, and living from their hearts, and I think, and and there's something else.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:25:00.000
What is one's deepest, fear and bloggage, and cringe and like you just wanna abort it at all costs or or what in one moment might frighten me so deed I'm Completely Stuck in my life, well, it might be another person's Passion and they might have found

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:11.000
A way out of it, and it's for me. It's about and that's and making those links like who is really good at this specific issue, or okay, this this situation.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Seems can we find someone who is recognizable, might reach this deepest place where this certain situation, is it could be really the most difficult issues like, yeah, I have also examples.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:44.000
There, for mediation, work and deep filing situations and stuff, so it's all possible and I won't need these examples just to put it out in the field, so we we can look at it and recognize that this is possible and that this is also.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
That's all possible

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Where we want to work. From this recognition of the deepest, and at the same time the the change.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Yeah

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Thanks Eric, I appreciate that okay, we're we're 2 min over.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So Jason decided jump if anybody else has to jump or once you thank you

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I'd like to just hear real quickly what Wendy has to put in before he comes out

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Yeah, I'd just like to Honor Bill's story and Eric's contribution.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Because I think it it heralds it shows why? Why?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And how we can get so stuck with a lot of our online interactions and where we're not close to one, another.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And that was the first point that Morgan made about being co-located.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because when you do tangible something, you've got all your senses that can physically be a vote. You're touching something.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:47.000
You know you've got the pain and the smell, and all that stuff, and you can be in another place because our words come from our senses but they're buried in you know count the number, of decades, you've lived we are listed with this really incomplete, sense of communication

01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Because to get to what a word means for someone. You got a deal way back to where that word was first, that like Like bill was talking about you know that was decades and decades ago and that word has got laser ma as in may, as the mayors of meeting and we're not talking about just

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:17.000
One word, so we're trying really hard here to aggregate what it is that we're help holding between ourselves just with words online, it's pretty brave, when you think about it because that was so like you know count the people we've got 9 here, at the moment and how many decades.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Worth of learning one word have we got, and that one word and the values that go with it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And the experiences are completely different and every time we use 50 words, we've got 50 Versions of our 9 sets of experiences over however, many decades of what that one word means so we're really trying to hunt what that is and negotiate it all the time and we will never get

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It, but when you do the painting you've got the paint on the paint, and it doesn't matter.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You don't actually have to have the word. So there's something really important, about doing physical things with physical people that at least gives you that experience of flow.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
That doesn't need the words, and you know massive Wikis and all the tools in the world.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:15.000
It is almost it is impossible to trace what that meaning means, especially if it's a value.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So you chasing shadows the whole time. So yeah, I'm I think do as many physical things as possible.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Even if it's in Twos and Threes, across this group, I know Wendy Em and you and Kalu had Mail together, in New York recently

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Lovely, Yeah, and I feel a little strange down here in Australia.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But Yeah, Nope, words are really tricky, they will. Yeah, and yet we have to use them.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And Try, and Have Metaphors, and Other ways of making up for the lack of Depths that We'll get to

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Thank you.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And common experience certainly helps a lot to that

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Hello, keep your hands on the wheel

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Yeah, I think that I think that that speaks to the importance of of us getting really good at helping people towards multiple circles, and small, groups, right, because in addition to whatever these circles are finding forging online it's probably important to have our place based circles, where we can get our hands sturdy, in

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:28.000
A different way than, okay, so 2 people, we haven't heard from for us.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Just had to drop. I think the last person that hasn't spoken today, is Michael and I personally, would love to

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Before we go, just see, if you have any questions, would like to drop in from your beautiful heart and soul, Michael

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Nothing really Bubbling to get out. I've really gotten a lot out of what's been spoken.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I I resonated with the the

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:14.000
The the possible metaphors for the the practice of Dual Painting, and the idea.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I'm I'm always struck by in in groups.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Like this one, and lots of other ones, I I participate in

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
The.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:40.000
The fact that there are some many of them, and even within them there are individuals who are like engaged in some platform development.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I've been working on this, and I've got this way, and

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It's very very hard to

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:15.000
To dual, paint in this, in this world of all, of us trying to do good and what are the ways that we you know, put our our separate brushes to the same Canvas instead of our own, it's, just the the challenge of our time, so that's, work, the challenge of our our

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Chosen field here, but you know we're we're up against you know whatever else you can say about them

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Your you know, big tech companies and governments and you know forces of that are defending the way.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Things are they're all together, painting on the same canvas and We're individually, trying to find the way to do that we don't have the standards and the shared. You know economic, agreements, That's really tough so I I wanna

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Take that metaphor as as a hopeful note. Maybe it's another way.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:24.000
To get that idea across to people and I'm not just the recognition of how We're all in

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Thanks. Michael. It's beautiful. Yeah, I think it that goes back to that just makes me think of conditions. Again.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Right. It's like, what what are the and it's almost the same right or that we started the conversation by talking about what are the preconditions, and the pre-work That's Required to show up and be in a State, of flow what are the pre-work and free Conditions Required to Show up

01:32:46.000 --> 01:33:04.000
and Dual pains. What are they pre-work and preconditions required to make a dual Painting, go from a Dual, to a symphony, and how does that manifest if it's, you know Bill and a daughter, or Granddaughter, Versus, if it's, 10 of us Versus the it's, 8

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
1 billion of us, you know, and ideally, that's some point, maybe you know the ultimate ideal is that we learned how to do that together right.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And so those are the patterns that we're sensing.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Because 8 billion people can't paint together. But 2, people can paint together.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Well, so just just loving this conversation. Thank you.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:30.000
You know, maybe 10 people can paint something. Together. You know, 3 groups painting, 3 groups of 10 painting things might be able to find an edge and blend it.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:40.000
You know, we're seeing that in AI that you can take these different pairs. And then like go. Let's go in the middle right. So it's kind of that kind of thing you know, it's like this emergent. Phenomenon, but it's a great analogy, brother okay.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Or just agree on a format, so that we can make the most ahead

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, okay, wendy and then, then, we'll wrap

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Yeah, just just real quick to wrap it

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Flow. Feels good. So we want more of it. So it means when we provide conditions.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:20.000
And people come in who, and they feel that vibe in the room, even if they've never experienced it before they're gonna say I want more of that and they're gonna seek it out in other places, and I think that's true for a lot of positive, Emotions but particularly true, when

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:45.000
It's a group, vibe, you know, and so you feel it maybe at disney world.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yes, it is catching. Yeah, yeah, that there's something deeply within us, that in that's positively awarded and Paul's assignment experiences.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:56.000
When you go, and you find yourself putting the Mickey ears on. But we're talking about creating a vibe that's for innovation, and creativity and group, support and so I'm just wanna put that on that this idea, that once we start figuring this out, it will be catching

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:13.000
So okay, beautiful. Okay, so thank you. So much, that was delightful, call Wendy and Special Gratitude for the work you put in this last week to Consolidate Synthesize and be able to Present, back to this and it takes a lot, of effort and work, to synthesize itself.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And I deeply appreciate all you brought means a lot. Thank you

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Sure, and I was in flow, doing it, so it's great, it was joyful!

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
So it's joyful. Yeah, that's good.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
So if anybody has a question along the way, and they want to send me one they want me to consider something.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
My time is tight, but especially if you feel like it has meaning for this group or another group, that you're in not just a random research, exploration, but we could do that too.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That that's just a different exercise. But if you think it has particular meaning or purpose.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:49.000
For this group, or other groups, then I'd love to hear from you, thanks

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Okay, so we have 2 really concrete things happening over the next 3 weeks.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
As we get prepared for the for the next year, one is wendy, M.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I think I heard you guys volunteer to get together and do a session on a 3, survey or communication that could go out to people that want to continue engaging so we can gauge the stories and experiences that have already happened and then we'll get together, with a group of 5 we

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
discussed and kind of Refine that and it would be great to get that out.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I don't know. When you guys think it's possible that maybe we could get it out by December Fifteenth, or something.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And give everybody the second half of the month to respond to it.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:43.000
If that's unrealistic no problem. But maybe over the next short period of time, do that so that's great and then the other thing, is if we can I'll take about whether we or any of the other 3 or 5, people, we could.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Think of Would Wanna participate Together in a 12 week series at the opening of the Year to go through all we've been learning and experiencing in a more structured way, that we talked about that'd be great for Us, to be Getting that kind of group together, and that Provides kind of be able to Path through the

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Next 90 days, and I think as we reflect on all those things in the New Year.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
There's so much that was kind of born, this spring, or through the summer. Some of the things got you know, laid down in the fall, and We've got all these ideas.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But all of that is such valuable life and ideas that are formed, and I trust that that will all come bursting into me like this, spring.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So thank you so much for being here today, deeply love and appreciate each of you and look Forward. To chatting with you through the week and Hopefully, seeing most of you next Week I see you soon

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Alright much love an appreciation. See, you guys soon have a wonderful joyful week
