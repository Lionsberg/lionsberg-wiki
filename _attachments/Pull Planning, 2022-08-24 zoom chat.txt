00:35:03	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	Cars and houses = “nothing about the environment"? ;-)
00:35:53	Wendy Elford:	Yes exactly - I was asked to write about one I was not aiming to do and magically all of the other starting points were there!
00:36:18	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	I wonder what the Earth has to say about the SDGs?
00:37:42	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	Gaia is always speaking, @Ken. Question is whether we listen.
00:37:54	Wendy McLean, NY:	+100 Mila
00:38:02	Wendy Elford:	Managing limiting assumptions at the beginning - I like that as a starting point for thinking
00:38:09	Marianne Wyne:	Thank you Mila for reframing this ❤️
00:38:30	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	A list of other frameworks including but also in addition to the SDGs which may hold a piece of the puzzle… https://www.catalist.network/explore-frameworks
00:39:21	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	To put a little poetic language in here: To care for the children of all species for all time (not my words, but words I feel a strong attraction to)
00:39:25	Wendy Elford:	We need people thinking for themselves so the problem is redistributed
00:39:47	Wendy McLean, NY:	Thank you Vincent for that link!  Was thinking of your list of interconnected frameworks!

00:40:12	Mila:	+1 Ken.. how to be the best future ancestor now
00:40:20	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Thanks Vincent!
00:40:38	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Kaen that would be Bill McDonough what said that
00:40:59	Pete Kaminski:	William McDonough: The two questions my colleagues and I are now asking ourselves in our work are: “How do we love all the children of all species for all time?” Not just our children. Not just our species. Not just now. All the children, of all species, for all time. And the second: “When do we become native to this place?”

00:42:14	Mila:	How to be the best future ancestor now for all life forms?
00:42:21	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	My latest version: what if we acted as though we actulaly belong to the living world? (And each other?)
00:42:22	Mila:	How to design for a meaningful life?
00:42:44	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	Bucky had a take on this long ago…
00:42:49	Mila:	+1 Gil. We are nature :-)
00:43:29	Mila:	Unfortunately I have to go dear friends. I'll try to come back in an hour's time.
00:43:55	Marianne Wyne:	Buckminster Fuller said, 'Make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone'
00:44:08	Marianne Wyne:	Thank you Gil!

00:45:10	Pete Kaminski:	"World Game – Buckminster Fuller Institute"
https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/world-game/
00:46:01	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	I also wonder what indigenous peoples would contribute to this list?
00:46:16	Pete Kaminski:	from Gil: "100% of humanity and all the beings with whom we share the living world"
00:46:22	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	Buckminster Fuller said, 'Make the world work, for 100% of humanity, (and all beings with whom we share the living world), in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone'
00:47:27	Killu Sanborn:	To Wendy E's point holding the everythingness of Life - perhaps do as Gil suggested, see us as living in a living universe (Gil, please correct if you said something different)
00:47:58	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	I guess I'll be slightly contrarian and say that I think we might be better off with making the world work for maybe 95% of humanity - I have no desire to make the world work for fascist and nazis for example…
00:47:58	Killu Sanborn:	Living world includes everything (including decay that brings life to other forms of life)
00:49:47	Wendy Elford:	somebody - the miro board link?
00:49:50	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Ken: So is your plan to kill then? lock them up? ship them to MuskMars?
00:49:58	Wendy McLean, NY:	Miro https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPc2HLgQ=/
00:50:02	Pete Kaminski:	seems like it might fit in here, 10 Japanese philosophy / life concepts, as explained by an American: https://twitter.com/jamierusso/status/1562468751756255234
00:50:07	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Killu decay is living too
00:50:18	Forrist Lytehaause:	… (including decay that brings life to other forms of life)which then must include extinction on some species, yet through the impacts of man. We surrender to the multi-billion year wisdom of Life's inherent regeneration, creativity and intelligence.,
00:50:47	Forrist Lytehaause:	meant - yet NOT through the impacts of man.
00:51:52	Pete Kaminski:	and hackmd links: https://twitter.com/jamierusso/status/1562468751756255234
00:51:52	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	@Gil - personally, I don't have a plan, but it might be that some people who are unable to legitimize the rights  of others will need to be isolated in some way and studied and worked with to help them. Some may be beyond help.
00:53:06	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Ken: Can you entertain the possibility of including them in the circle of care? (And even loving them?)
00:53:15	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	Time to check in with Dalai Lama…
00:54:18	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	what about future generations?
00:54:25	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	+1 Vincent
00:54:28	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	@Gil - if someone tells me I do not have the right to exist and that they will kill or enslave me I am not going to worry too much about loving them.
00:55:03	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Maybe one goal - previously mentioned - is learning to be a good ancestor
00:56:16	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	@Gil see Thich Nhat Hahn's story of the monk who killed a pirate who boarded a boat with women and children. He recognized that if he did take the pirate's life then many other lives would be taken
00:56:18	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Ken, I get that. And struggle with it. So are you going to kill them? Lock them up? LOck them up and refuse to feed them? Lock them up and shoot them when they “try to escape”? Send them to reeducation camps? Hope they don't kill you?
00:56:42	Wendy McLean, NY:	@Ken, For me, those are not mutually exclusive.  I can love them, and disagree with their behavior/ intention/ attitude / approach (especially as it threatens my own freedom)
00:56:43	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	@Gil - personally, I don't have a plan, but it might be that some people who are unable to legitimize the rights  of others will need to be isolated in some way and studied and worked with to help them. Some may be beyond help.
00:56:54	Wendy Elford:	suggestion herre - verbs not nouns!
00:56:54	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	TNHis not a pacifist. Nor am I. Bu thta's not the question I'm asking you.
00:56:56	Marianne Wyne:	@Gil - love your thought of validating this with the Dali Lama
00:57:15	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Ken: we should tawk…
00:57:30	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	@Gil - you know where I live😉
00:57:58	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	@Ken - You know where I live 😉
00:58:01	Gil Friend - linktr.ee/gpfriend:	I’ve got to hop. Love to all.

01:00:03	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	I can take infrastructure
01:00:20	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	the academy?
01:00:27	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	like hollywood XD
01:08:11	Wendy Elford:	Can we please consider using verbs - what the needs are expressed as things that are being done
01:08:21	Pete Kaminski:	5 to 10 primary, key needs of the group you're representing, that would need to be met more fulfilled in order for that vision or intention that we share to manifest itself.
01:11:35	Wendy McLean, NY:	@ Wendy E, good idea.  Can you give an example.  If I write ‘I need a save place to live' what would that become?
01:12:04	Wendy McLean, NY:	*safe place
01:13:24	Wendy Elford:	ACADEMY
1. Noticing what is going on here real time
01:16:05	Jonathan Sand:	CIVIL SOCIETY: 1. distinguish fact from opinion, 2. encourage trustworthy behavior, 3. celebrate benevolent action, 4. nurture reasoning, creativity and passion, 5. guarantee everyone basic needs
01:16:29	Wendy Elford:	ACADEMY
1. Noticing what is going on here real time
ACADEMY
2. Sharing information about the state of worksite earth
ACADEMY
3. Holding differences in information lightly
ACADEMY
4. Supporting people to think for themselves
ACADEMY
5. Weaving a new narrative that is infinite
01:17:02	Pete Kaminski:	from Jordan: maybe milestone 2 out of 5 was that we had a certain number of prototypes or pockets of coherence that we're living it out that the world could see.
01:18:13	Hank Kune:	Sorry, it's late at night here, and I have to go now.
This is a difficult exercise, and I don’t know if I understood things correctlyu.
I decided to ‘share’ the voice sof past and future generations (with Ken).

Here are my ideas:
01:18:25	Hank Kune:	Past & Future Generations
•	Neither past nor future generations understand what is happening now.
•	Past generations cry out: have you not been able to learn from what we went through?
•	Future generations demand: listen better to your own children and grandchildren. Try to imagine a world in the future,  when many gazillions of humans strive to achieve the same quality of life that you think you have.
01:18:34	Hank Kune:	Voices from the Past:
Do you honor the lessons WE have learned
We struggled to give you the world you inherited – where is your struggle now?
 Do you still honor your ancestors, or sell our graves to satisfy your greed?
01:18:40	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	goal: selecting, using, and maintaining the right solutions
01:18:48	Hank Kune:	Future voices
What story do you bequeath us? How do you want us to remember you once you are gone?
Life is a give-and-take: we see you take, what do you give?
01:20:23	Marianne Wyne:	For soil, microbiome, water, air:The entirety of Worksite Earth inherently know how to continuously create an anti-fragile system based on our inherent intelligence, creativity, being regenerative, and operating in networks
01:20:43	Killu Sanborn:	Energy perspective: Without energy, nothing happens. It is primary even if  humans don't treat it as such. For human thriving, we need extra energy. We consume much more than we create, increasingly fast. This is the key issue around energy. If humans learn how to create more energy than to consume, they have turned the situation around. There are different forms of energy. Humans don't yet know what they are, how to work with them, how to use them, how to magnify them into greater coherence and abundance, and alignment with material wellbeing. Lots is wasted, way too much is wasted. Not much is used of what all is available Issue comes from ignorance, and lack of respect.
01:21:21	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	Infrastructure:
Right material selection so I last as long as is possibly appropriate/ideal for my use
People who properly know how to use me
Knowing what the future conditions will be
Risk analysis of what could go wrong
01:21:53	Killu Sanborn:	•	Humans learned how to energize each other in coherence and resonance to better use their own life energy, and energy in systems between people.•	Humans learned how to not waste energy, both external and internal, they became very intentional about seeing, measuring, gathering, distributing, using energy, and learned to recreate energy circularly, so went from linear wasting and using energy to reclaiming what they can.•	Humans learned where to capture and generate already available energy from natural sources that they could put in circular systems
01:22:00	Killu Sanborn:	•	Humans learned how very dependent all their endeavors are on energy, how they are manifestations of energy themselves along with everything else, and how therefore from understanding how to manage and manipulate themselves, others, world as energy, a completely different dimension opened up of what became possible – in interexchange, interbeing, interflowing, circularity of energetic movements, expression, capturing, transformation into new/different forms.
01:22:32	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Looks like Hank and I are both representing past and futrue generations - how awesome is that?!
01:27:51	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Bill - I hope you don't mind me speaking form a biz point here: True cost accounting is a major step in the transformation req'd to make the world work for all.
01:29:11	Michael Grossman (Factr):	I was interrupted for a bit, apologies if “individuals” went unrepresented—but hey, what else is new?
01:29:23	Forrist Lytehaause:	Food:- thriving, diverse microbiome- pure, living water- energy source for that which is growing- maximizing foods physical and energetic vitality, during  -- harvesting-- storage-- processing-- transportation-- presentation for consumption including taste and aesthetics Outcome: maximum pleasure, nutrition and vitality transferred and experienced by food consumer (any living being)
01:29:36	Michael Grossman (Factr):	We’ll try to catch up.
01:40:17	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has actually done this exercise with their Vision 2050: The New Roadmap for Business - which was completed in the late 2000s. The resulting map looks at 9 areas over the timeframe of 2010s to 2050s to reach a sustainable world: https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us/Vision-2050-Time-to-Transform
01:41:20	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Still here listening…
01:42:28	Killu Sanborn:	Key milestone to have happened will have to be humans having understood their interconnectedness with each other and nature. We hold it as a far out goal, but it is really not and can happen fairly fast.
01:43:09	Killu Sanborn:	With that understanding of interconnectedness, government, business and human activities will necessarily shift to reflect a different sense of self and relationship with all else.
01:44:02	Wendy McLean, NY:	From Michael:  (1) Health, survival, air water food, (2) love, belonging, (3) … () Freedom of thought
01:44:53	William Larson:	Five major milestones met for business to fully and effectively contribute to the sustainable world goals: (1) Diverse talent and perspectives incorporated into business teams; (2) A tipping point number of business leaders embrace a regenerative view of business; (3) significant capital generated to bring an exemplary number of businesses to join a steward ownership system to raise a unique standard; (4) business leaders become a positive influence worldwide for sustainable and human-oriented practices and growth; (5) business is generally viewed as an agency of responsibility, cooperative activity, and creative and sustainable growth.
01:46:03	Marianne Wyne:	A pivot that will exponentially reduce production of toxins, could be something like countries enact their war measures act and wind down major poluters such as Monsanto/Bayers, etc. based on a plan to emphasize regenerative enterprises that focus on building syntropic systems.
01:46:54	Pete Kaminski:	from Michael (via transcript):  For individuals, I was sort of bucketing 5 groups of needs, stated goals. You know things that are important.

One being survival, air, water, food.

Then love, belonging, family, friendship

Then safety, security, equality, and justice.

Then assembly, movement, association, travel and communication, thinking, learning, freedom of thought

All of those I can break down still further.

Those are kind of 50,000 foot views of things that are important, that overlap all the other categories.
01:47:06	Wendy McLean, NY:	Thank you Pete!
01:47:13	Killu Sanborn:	Adding to Bill's excellent points from business perspective - (6) People recognize business is THE fastest and most dynamic lever to effect change in societies (not education, art, government, nonprofits, healthcare etc. - think of biggest changes in your daily life, like technology driven shifts - all became possible when business brought it to the masses). Only natural disasters and military coups and wars can be more dynamic.
01:48:28	Killu Sanborn:	"Life is directly speaking to us - our ability to understand what the messages are coming from vibrations of life in all its spectrum - AI interprets as ANS of planet - life is creative, regenerative, intelligent - with information, quality deicions are made"
01:48:33	Killu Sanborn:	(From Forrist)
01:48:54	William Larson:	+1 Killu; all of this is a part of analyzing and identifying the tipping points in each area of society, and then determining what pushes the numbers most effectively to those tipping points.
01:49:44	Wendy Elford:	Human sensor networks too - plurality of people noticing
01:50:25	Marianne Wyne:	++1 Killu
01:50:57	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	Ai is only as good as the people developing the algorithms. Until we have a more diverse population dong the coding - and by diverse, I mean not simply gender or ethnicity, but cognitive diversity including indigenous perspectives, AI will keep advancing the problems we are trying to solve…
01:52:28	Killu Sanborn:	A key milestone around human wellbeing - humans become conversant about managing their emotional world, able to manage their emotionality, emotional addictions, need for drama etc., and instead know peace, strength, agency and belonging without emotional baggage. Once emotion is managed/released productively, people will be able to be well with each other in ways they now are not able to, as they get so easily triggered and bent out of shape at unimportant happenings. (Hollywood will not be making as many low vibing dramas, and dramas overall...).
01:52:53	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Ken
01:53:05	Ken Homer • SF Bay Area •:	I have another call at the top of the hour - will drop off in a few mins. This has been lovely - thanks all!
01:54:22	Jonathan Sand:	celebrating benevolence, good questions, fact proving
01:54:28	Judith Benham:	Facilitate capacity for human change (familial, educational, cultural, institutional)
01:54:59	Pete Kaminski:	by "cybernetics", wendy e is referring to "the science of communication and control theory that is concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic control systems (e.g. the nervous system and brain and mechanical-electrical communication systems)"
01:55:28	Pete Kaminski:	"Vision 2050: Time to Transform - World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)"
https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us/Vision-2050-Time-to-Transform
01:55:49	Vincent Arena (Catalist Commons):	https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us/Vision_2050
01:56:35	William Larson:	+1 Ken; so true.  Those people will not be attractive to steward ownership of companies, as just one issue.
01:56:39	Marianne Wyne:	+++ @Ken
01:57:18	Pete Kaminski:	"Bob Horn"
https://www.bobhorn.us/
01:57:25	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Areas of need for INDIVIDUALS:
01:57:26	Jonathan Sand:	+ ken. perhaps figure out how to out-compete the forces-that-be?
01:57:46	Michael Grossman (Factr):	HEALTH: Food, water, air, movement, shelter
01:58:00	Michael Grossman (Factr):	BELONGING: love, family, friendship, community
01:58:15	Michael Grossman (Factr):	PERSONHOOD: Identity, agency, freedom, individuality, respect
01:58:28	Michael Grossman (Factr):	SECURITY: Safety, equality, justice, privacy, representation, power
01:58:41	Michael Grossman (Factr):	EXPRESSION: communication, art, education, access, dialogue, reflection, private thought
01:58:53	Michael Grossman (Factr):	PRESENCE: Assembly, travel, association, housing
01:58:53	Killu Sanborn:	Develop new filters that help us notice emergence faster; and know how emergence shows up, and support it arising. (One filter: notice when something/idea, people etc. is being dismissed, which is a power and privilege based defensive move - shows new trying to come in)
01:59:02	Pete Kaminski:	from Judy: "There's a dimension of capacity for human change that has to precede institutional change. Until humans start looking at the world differently, and believe they have individually the capacity to change themselves, and the things that they interface with, we can't have institutional change."
02:00:03	Killu Sanborn:	Humans will learn to value intuition and develop skillful uses of it.
02:05:55	Marianne Wyne:	Very true @Jonathan - we need to engage kids from early childhood - before their inherent creativity, intelligence, etc. is 'knocked out' of them....
02:05:59	Michael Grossman (Factr):	+1 Killu re new filters!
02:07:01	Killu Sanborn:	On good news side, people will be surprised at how many good things open up really fast once they live from their self-view as interconnected, conscious beings with intuitive, energetic, emotional and intellectual skills and abilities that can cohere and resonate in groups, creating exponential returns from little effort, because that is the true nature of such powers well expressed and managed.
02:07:42	Marianne Wyne:	Thanks for that insight @Kilu
02:07:48	Pete Kaminski:	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation
02:07:59	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Killu. ABSOLUTELY
02:08:06	Killu Sanborn:	+1 on desire for purpose as a very powerful lever
02:09:01	Wendy McLean, NY:	Cultivating a sense of meaning and purpose - Use your top strengths more often: www.viacharacter.org
02:09:11	Marianne Wyne:	@Bill - from my European/Danish point of view, the great resignation happened because US enterprises did not respect work/life balance, etc. It did not happen in Europe and only nominally in Canada.
02:09:32	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Maryanne... that makes SO MUCH sense
02:10:06	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Maryanne - super interesting!
02:10:17	Marianne Wyne:	❤️
02:10:50	Killu Sanborn:	Different use of time, from 9-5 in office, to chunks of time between "work" and "meaningful other stuff" chunks, still being productive. This allows for more of the "meaningful other stuff" to be done while honoring productive work as well.
02:10:58	Michael Grossman (Factr):	+1 Bill re meaning and purpose. I was struck by how I was hard pressed to put “business, commerce, financial transaction” on my list of individual needs except in so far as they have become a means to the others
02:11:29	Killu Sanborn:	Skillful use of Emergence In Groups, like what we are doing here now!
02:12:12	Killu Sanborn:	Liberating latently available energy and insight by working together in aligned emergent groups
02:14:52	Wendy Elford:	for shifting to more purposive, individual and generative space, I commend the book 40 thousand weeks https://www.penguin.com.au/books/four-thousand-weeks-9781784704001
02:18:07	Killu Sanborn:	Pulling information that is available, through a group. If purpose is to get serious outcomes, let's use what deep robust thinking and mapping already exists in the world done by smart folks. Lacking is survey and clarity on what could be taken off the shelf to include, using a similar process. Whatever our impulse is to create - has it already been created and where do we go with that.
02:18:12	Killu Sanborn:	(From Forrist)
02:18:28	Wendy Elford:	From a sytems perspective - we already know it is just not connected up in relations and action
02:20:02	Killu Sanborn:	Forming a rich shared understanding of core movement, layer in what has been done will illuminate other pathways. What we are doing is better illuminating the "soft stuff" that seems mostly missing from the other frameworks. (Jordan) - leads to actionable plan with validatin of what has come, and steps to take next, synthesizing the frameworks and more.
02:20:37	Killu Sanborn:	Forrist; ID which groups to reach out to, to invite representatives from best ones to join working group of synthesis.
02:23:08	Killu Sanborn:	Vincent: liked emergence of what came up of different perspectives and milestones. Wish that process be made more clear. Thought we would be doing more project management, vs interactive brainstorming. Would have come prepared differently. Could we spend time preparing before meeting so we don't start from blank Miro board, as so much work has been done. Don't have time to pull it into the process. I'd like a second brain to store this, or won't come up in meeting if not prepared. To model that - what would process be like to get towards next 6 week plan.
02:23:46	Wendy McLean, NY:	FYI... I'm capturing these reflections in the miro
02:24:41	Killu Sanborn:	Need couple of cycles (Wendy E), and connecting them up...stay open to where work harder to language it better, don't drop too soon.
02:25:38	Killu Sanborn:	Jordan: usingintuition to start with a broader picture to orient everyone, then all know what to do, then go for what can be done in next 6 weeks. Also taking other frameworks, start forming critical project path schedule with those as well. Iterate every couple weeks.
02:25:58	Killu Sanborn:	Marianne: not all in chat ended up on Miro board.
02:26:11	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Apologies, my phone battery may die before my desire to participate does.
02:26:26	Killu Sanborn:	BRB
02:26:47	Wendy McLean, NY:	<3 Michael
02:27:25	Pete Kaminski:	@Michael, the spirit is willing but the electricity is weak. :-)
02:28:07	Pete Kaminski:	from Wendy M: "Does it feel right for the next 30 min to move into a what feels most alive for us to accomplish in the next 6 weeks?"
02:29:54	Killu Sanborn:	What is already is live and happening, where is already movement and action, vs intellectual choice on board...Wendy M - could do next or next week - go from here is what is alive, here is where we are going. Which things are already reaching towards each other, with just a little energy will connect.
02:30:08	Wendy Elford:	For me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%CA%BBoponopono Gives me personal responsibility
02:30:35	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Wendy! Such power in looking at where there is momentum right now. Using energy well is very much about using momentum - indigenous medicine folks know that very well
02:31:02	Killu Sanborn:	Marianne: did not finish the board work yet.
02:31:42	Marianne Wyne:	I'd love to help @Jordan but there are no more hours in my day.... next time!
02:32:06	Killu Sanborn:	Jordan: asking for help to get to next level 30,000 f view...then merge with what is here now emerging alive already.
02:32:07	William Larson:	The board/map could provide helpful measures to evaluate projects in concept.
02:32:13	Killu Sanborn:	Happy to help with that Jordan.
02:32:59	Killu Sanborn:	Judy: complexity and depth in multiple dimensions. How do we reach agency that is already in effect so we don't recreate what already exist, but can partner. Think of mechanics of how connect with growing structure and other people, initiatives, thoughts.
02:33:55	Killu Sanborn:	Wendy E: could do little experiment, to our willingness to do something on a personal level - changing self at same time - a commitment of I am going to do X. Self-action. If you can't do that, there is a problem of a first order there.
02:34:44	Marianne Wyne:	@Judy and @Wendy M - re. finding the enterprises/people who are already focusing on the work represented in each of these stickies and pull them in so we don't start from scratch.
02:34:45	Killu Sanborn:	Jordan: combine some streams - finish the stratetic approach, see what can be done in 6 weeks, look at emerging streams of what is alive - then can look at what little things each can engage and commit to, next week after completing framework.
02:36:50	Killu Sanborn:	Wendy M: Master Flow board has a lot on it, including partnerships and resources - has been putting together after calls - can share so we see what was shared has been captured, we can trust what surfaces won't get lost
02:38:38	Killu Sanborn:	Jonathan - each of us has a passion - this group is eager to gather passion and help integrate it
02:46:00	Pete Kaminski:	from Wendy M: increasing potential for partnerships, right? So what's emerging behind the scenes is a recognition of how many people are interconnected by one degree of separation, and I think there's going to be increased opportunity to capitalize on those inter-relationships.
02:46:15	Killu Sanborn:	Low hanging fruit: people we know, with one degree connection - example of Graham Boyd - bring in governance, business angle that will attract more
02:46:22	Killu Sanborn:	(Wendy M)
02:47:32	Killu Sanborn:	How we do process, hold trust - help practice acting on things together - MP as collectin of people trying ot advance collective action together  - focus on process of collaborative action and picking what to act on helps us get better - looking to improve process by picking areas of focus, like what are most alive, in greatest motion.
02:47:45	Killu Sanborn:	Focus on areas of most momentum and energy
02:48:00	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Wendy
02:48:34	Pete Kaminski:	thanks all, it's time for me to drop, looking forward to more progress!
02:48:40	Killu Sanborn:	Sees two parallel thrusts, one person to person, connections, relationships, partnerships, self and community actualization - evolvingin parallel with tenhnological advancement
02:48:46	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Wendy
02:49:20	Wendy Elford:	IMprove ability to sustain relationships with others first - necessary starting point
02:49:38	Killu Sanborn:	Jonathan asks each of us to learn new skills, encourage other people's ideas to be developed - emerging skill for us to be learning together
02:49:59	Killu Sanborn:	Education, skills acquisition as important, existing training
02:51:45	Wendy Elford:	Just dropping off - and energy - and seeing it - Killu can you help me with that?
02:52:58	Killu Sanborn:	Sure Wendy E - and help make it more concrete so I know what exactly we are working on
02:53:32	Killu Sanborn:	Judy: wisdom is ongoing in its development in other existing entities - what mechanism to keep pace with that
02:54:08	Killu Sanborn:	Killu: use momentum, it is a technical useful skill, not just a soft woo thing. Used by investors, for example, regularly.
02:55:03	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	How was this for people who didn't speak a lot
02:55:36	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Assingn to role - of inviting in voices...
02:55:42	Killu Sanborn:	Technical question - how to notice who is not participating when screen shows those doing it most.
02:55:47	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Choosing roles for the meetings....
02:56:10	Killu Sanborn:	Marianne: do rounds so everyone knows they get to speak, keep it short
02:56:51	Wendy Elford:	Going now - thanks.
02:57:02	Marianne Wyne:	Bye Wendy
02:57:15	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Learning: Framing is critical... really providing clear framing ahead of time... which forms expectations...
02:57:43	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Pausing mid way to reflect and bring new things forth...
02:57:46	Killu Sanborn:	Forrist: Two screens help if Miro and chat to follow. Also pausing helped, in reflection.
02:59:16	Judith Benham:	The depth of skill, willingness to contribute, and continuous learning,
02:59:17	William Larson:	I found it energizing to see how the group has such unity in the midst of diversity of skills and viewpoints, and to see how that is a pool of resources for things that I believe are about to happen,
02:59:17	Marianne Wyne:	What we did today was for me a milestone - very energizingI feel we need to make the content on the board more concise - bringing in everything in the chat - and the work done by others to make it 'whole'This was very helpful and inspiring
02:59:18	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I enjoy having a high trust group where we can experiment and learn how to do all this... that includes people focused on improvng the methodologies... so that we can help / serve / align others in the future. Thank you.
02:59:18	Jonathan Sand:	representing roles was a nice way to increase the overall focus
02:59:20	Killu Sanborn:	Worked well: Being self-aware, and inviting to be self aware, as a group of what we were doing and how we went about it, and what emerged - and being self-aware while in generative process speaking from emergence, is much more powerful than linear intellectual process based on what we already know. We went back and forth on different levels and it worked well, isn't always a given though. We have trust.
03:00:54	Marianne Wyne:	Elect a facilitator who will be in charge of the rounds to ensure everyone is heardAllow for preparation before so we don't start from a blank slate and what is top of mind
03:00:54	Judith Benham:	Definition of “forethought” areas for the group to maximize breadth/wisdom.
03:00:54	Jonathan Sand:	shorter more structured shares?
03:00:55	William Larson:	Framing, setting up in advance would be helpful. I will enjoy the practical application of this as things develop over the next 2 or 3 weeks.
03:00:55	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	More framing and understanding up front. Homework in advance of the sessions for people to orient and be prepared... Maybe a short intro video in advance of the process? More skilled faclitation across the different backgrounds...
03:01:03	Killu Sanborn:	Improve: what was frustrating, deenergizing - positively, what can do better? - Wasn't frustrated so hard to answer from that! Liked we were open as a group to try something experimentally, and accept what came and how, and be open to feedback of what else could help and be good. Felt a little rushed could have gone deeper in every point but wasn't really needed.
03:01:42	Marianne Wyne:	Good luck to you and Mila using this process tomorrow @Jordan
