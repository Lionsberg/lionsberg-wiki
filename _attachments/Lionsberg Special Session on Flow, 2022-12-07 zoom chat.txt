01:42:23	Morgan Browning:	Kill, thank you for asking:  What does group flow look like?  I seeâ€¦   1.  Colocation / an island of light  2.  live collaboration  2.  asynchronous reporting and communications  3.  iterative planning cycles  4.  hierarchical multivariate optimization of intention/activity   5.  open project roles that play to strengths  6. consensus driven and love-borne objectives  7.  shared positive experiences  8.  genuine curiosity and expansion in all relationships  9.  grounding and shared vibration / intention  10.  co-creative expression and feedback
