00:37:46	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Our challenge is to get the people who are working on value-aligned projects (which we can recognize as already ‚Äúin" the metaproject) to work together, or at very least in harmony (ie literal incentive toward mutual success, not toward ‚Äúwinning‚Äù or even ‚Äúleading‚Äù but fellowship and ‚Äúfollowship‚Äù.
00:39:47	Forrist Lytehaause:	Perhaps, it is useful consider an analogy of fungi, mycelium. What does it do? It is the pathway to connect nodes and feed the visible areas plants, andimals, etc.
00:40:14	Michael Grossman (Factr):	It SEEMS (from what Jordan and Bill and others have been developing), like Lionsberg could model this at small scale among projects here.
00:40:44	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Michael
00:41:32	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Michael
00:41:38	Wendy Elford:	I think Jason has a good project to look at - right scale
00:41:42	Michael Grossman (Factr):	+1 Forrist Right, more like roots-up connection and responsiveness and nourishment than top-down coordination
00:44:02	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1.  AND I'm thinking it's both... roots up (interconnection / bottom up) and facilitating the environment for growth (middle) and providing a direction / vision of what's possible while coordinating the whole (top down)
00:44:18	Killu Sanborn:	+1 Bill "what is the superpower of this community","be message takers, aggregations, connectors, servants of the process"
00:44:57	Killu Sanborn:	(aggregators)
00:45:12	Killu Sanborn:	"When things are fragmented they are ineffective"
00:45:41	Judith Benham:	+ Bill re super powers
00:46:12	Wendy McLean, NY:	We absolutely can do this!
00:46:37	Killu Sanborn:	+Jordan on key being human beings being able to work well together (and be well with themselves and each other)
00:47:08	William Larson:	+1 Jason; we were made for unity and community
00:47:44	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Jason, being the attractor orienting everyone toward a common play-space.
00:47:53	Marianne Wyne:	+1 Bill - Planetary CARE is about to experiment doing exactly what you are saying - it is a pilot. We are bringing all stakeholders in the food value chain into a Soil-first/Regenerative Ag Industry Association (which currently represents 1% of agriculture) to bring all these players together to help farmers revert back to regenerative farming methods and rebuild the local/regional food value chains across the globe.
00:48:21	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Jason, this is a community of practice
00:48:45	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Jason, bringing in systems thinking. Need for deep clarity about the coherence between relationships, context and patterns
00:49:38	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Marianne, Forrist and PlanetaryCARE, hurrah!!!
00:53:30	William Larson:	+1 Wendy; this helps explain the massive market for self-help books; people hungry for change jump to the next thing that promises much.
00:54:36	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Wendy E. One principle may be the clarity between protocols vs guidelines. Guidelines = take the 'guideline' as a default if one needs the pattern in the guideline AND feel free to test your own method if you believe it will produce superior results. Then as you've run the experiment, loop improvements back to the whole.
00:54:59	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Forrist!!
00:55:27	Jason Schulist:	+1 Forrist
00:55:47	Michael Grossman (Factr):	‚ÄúUnity‚Äù is hard to impose. It's not for us to structure and order others. It's more the recognition of the overall movement of the flotilla of our not-always-coordinated but mutually supportive efforts.
00:56:57	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Mixing metaphors, the vessels in the flotilla (some of them way ahead of us!) are connected below the waterline by the loose tether of our network (Forrist's mycelium)
00:57:16	Wendy McLean, NY:	* need a language of complexity & change to be able to discuss emergence‚Ä®* don't force structure‚Ä®* listen to others as a way to best evolve our system for the benefit of others AND ourselves
00:57:23	Wendy McLean, NY:	...from Wendy E
01:02:33	Judith Benham:	+ Michael - totally agree unity can‚Äôt be imposed, will happen if there is shared vision & alignment.
01:02:49	Marianne Wyne:	+1 Judy!
01:02:54	Wendy Elford:	We can map the energy over time and help us see where the energy is stronger and useful
01:03:18	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Killu - as Otto Scharmer suggest in presencing work - developing the skill to sense what wants to emerge form the future coming into the present. This comes for the commitment to inner personal development and ability to be internally calm and present to what wants to arise. I sense we are largely doing this with Jordan's path he is guiding.
01:03:43	William Larson:	+1 Killu: there is a hunger, but often an ignorance, about how to truly work together.
01:03:47	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Killu, holding the container for emergence.  Listening around the world for what wants to come together.  Feeling the energy build, where energy is sustained, composted and rebuilt.
01:04:48	Jason Schulist:	+1 Forrist - yes hold the space and apply Theory U towards the Meta objective
01:05:38	Jason Schulist:	+1 Killu - we are all connected: ask David Bohm (still üòÅ)
01:05:55	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Killu.  Rules (1) everything is already connected.  (2) If we learn deep listening to the emergence, (3) people will feel the vibe and are more likely to stick around
01:06:26	Wendy Elford:	++++ Killu we crave positive experiences in community and this is a needed first step in keeping people contributing to each other's worlds
01:06:37	Marianne Wyne:	So true @Wendy and @Killu.
01:07:41	Brad deGraf:	Thanks all. Have to go. Glad to tune in a bit. Looking forward to collaborating.
01:08:23	Jason Schulist:	Engineer as in, probe, test, and scale
01:08:27	Wendy McLean, NY:	Jordan: As creatively conscious beings, we already have the ability to create these spaces that we all need, and to engineer what we want to build
01:08:43	Wendy McLean, NY:	...engineering the space
01:08:45	Killu Sanborn:	+Jason
01:10:49	Killu Sanborn:	+Phil..and such connections are also form of emergence if we play it well
01:11:10	Pete Kaminski:	‚ÄúIf HP knew what HP knows, we'd be three times more productive.‚Äù - Lew Platt
01:11:18	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Jason
01:11:29	Jason Schulist:	Phil/Jordan: in construction, check out OS2 and the neighborhood that is developing to redefine construction and reduce transactional friction
01:12:39	Michael Grossman (Factr):	We are present in a movement. We succeed if the movement succeeds. So we succeed by supporting, recognizing, publicizing, connecting, nourishing as much of the movement as we can‚Äînot by owning, running, coordinating it‚Äîor whatever small portion of it we could ever begin to ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù
01:13:27	Killu Sanborn:	++Michael! old vs new way of being as we transitio
01:13:33	Wendy Elford:	Living the double and triple diamond
01:14:27	Wendy Elford:	+ Seeing the energy map of the current environment
01:14:55	Killu Sanborn:	+WE energy map!
01:15:37	Wendy Elford:	.... of where our activity is focussed and how our experiences of local and combined work is tracking energy wise
01:15:38	Wendy McLean, NY:	+Wendy E, energy map would be AMAZING!
01:16:30	Phil Stien:	Learn by doing
01:17:03	Killu Sanborn:	+WM, Jordan - learning and doing as embodied experience that includes all our faculties, including mental etc
01:17:04	Wendy Elford:	.... and learning fast what is emerging
01:17:34	Killu Sanborn:	+Forrist
01:17:45	Wendy McLean, NY:	AND, there are groups already advancing the tools.  WINfinity is one, BeingInSystems is another...
01:18:03	Pete Kaminski:	from Wendy M: "... then we'll still be able to listen to each other. Listen to the fringes. Listen to the stories. Listen to the patterning that is required to help us understand when we are pulling...

"How, if everything's funded, and not coordinated, oftentimes there are things that are pulling at opposites. And you're actually not moving at all, even though there's a lot of activity.

"That's where the emergent helps say 'No, no, no, *this* thing first, then that thing. Or yes, that's good, but if we all shift it in this direction, that would end up being the cornerstone for everyone.'"
01:18:12	Wendy McLean, NY:	‚Ä¶ they have years of experience in creating spaces for emergence and connection within corporations / orgs / teams
01:19:18	Wendy Elford:	Ritual and sharing actual experiences
01:19:25	Killu Sanborn:	in addition to ritual creating a container (externally perceived) they also open us to ways of being (internal) that we can then abide as and in
01:22:06	Forrist Lytehaause:	+1 Killu - rituals are one particular spot of a 'culture canvas' have clarity on all the areas of a culture map, increase clarity and thus power of the 'intention' seeking to emerge.
01:23:47	Wendy Elford:	It's not time, it is resources to scale this
01:24:06	Marianne Wyne:	+++1 Wendy E - I love that idea of using your maps! Yes Wendy M - I also wanted Wendy E to be using her magic tools yesterday ü§©
01:25:03	Marianne Wyne:	+1 Wendy M - YAY!!!
01:25:09	Wendy Elford:	Marianne - hope that the tools you had to  hand worked well enough
01:25:47	Forrist Lytehaause:	++1 Wendy M & E
01:26:37	Marianne Wyne:	@Wendy E - your tools/maps worked SO well. Amazing how the maps read the situation so close to what actually happened! Pure magic.
01:35:47	Wendy McLean, NY:	1) Resource funding‚Ä®2) Social Architecture‚Ä®3) Tech / Infrastructure‚Ä®4) Core Strategy‚Ä®5) Wisdom circle insights‚Ä®6) Process flows
01:39:05	Wendy McLean, NY:	Pete: Overhead and execution teams vs the coordination layer already articulated.  They're not the work, they enable the work
01:39:23	Wendy Elford:	Can we please have a project to learn from for a real small client
01:39:34	William Larson:	Great meeting everyone. I have to sign off to join another meeting.
01:39:50	Marianne Wyne:	+1 Pete - by doing the work we are experimenting and that is the best way to move forward faster. Fail fast. The best way to learn!
01:42:25	Wendy Elford:	example of art / poesis is AI art -
01:45:07	Wendy McLean, NY:	Suggesting other groups: ‚Ä®* Communications/Media (coordinating the messaging)‚Ä®* Arts (encourage vision and emergence)
01:45:43	Marianne Wyne:	+1 Wendy M. Both of those are critical!
01:47:34	Wendy Elford:	By small, super small might be a way to test the coherence of our teams
01:48:22	Wendy Elford:	++ test our structure with small project to get the focus - for insights
01:48:41	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Wendy E!
01:49:30	Wendy Elford:	Build a dam in the creek and learn from it before the larger dam in the river
01:49:45	Jason Schulist:	act to a new way of thinking
01:49:53	Wendy McLean, NY:	One more possible group: Science! (insights into vibrations, patterning, observations, etc)
01:51:12	Forrist Lytehaause:	The 6 + 2, groups, what's needed for all is: Onboarding this needs the culture map by whatever name, likely a 'buddy' during onboarding and a solid period - 90 days... all presuming resources to dedicate the sustained time to do this creation - btw, PCARE offers what we have learned and develoed if/when desired.
01:51:15	Wendy Elford:	Missing value in the system rather than a trope of attractor which is more of the same value always
01:53:22	Marianne Wyne:	Absolutely @Wendy E. A pilot is such a valuable way to learn. We want to create psychological safety so our teams feel encouraged to take risks in order to fail fast and that way we learn so much without too much damage. Then celebrate the failure. After building that smaller dam - we will have learned so much. Now we can plan how to build the bigger dam.
01:56:24	Wendy McLean, NY:	+1 Forrist, your onboarding thoughts is the flow Marianne and I are working on and Social Architecture is building
01:56:42	Wendy Elford:	Stories of experience (collective, individual) to show value is present and where it is
02:00:01	Wendy Elford:	Build the story onsite - to get new narrative at scale if shared for visibility for resources
02:00:58	Pete Kaminski:	"I Liked" - what did we do well that we should continue?
02:03:25	Wendy McLean, NY:	Liked:‚Ä®* heard from lots of people‚Ä®* heard about where the energy currently is within Meta Project‚Ä®* Felt people were building upon the threads in conversation without too much happening in chat - could easily follow and deeply consider each contribution‚Ä®* have a sense that we moved the needle ‚Äúforward‚Äù instead of going in circles.
02:03:32	Forrist Lytehaause:	1. The experience I had of feeling rich content, increasing clarity and a path of possible emergence occurring. Actions of continuing. Not sure what to say structurally for this. It felt as the dialogue was organic and in a sense of flow.
02:03:33	Wendy Elford:	Steady cadence of exchanges brought in the big undercurrents we were struggling to deal with. This isn't just paradox - it is the real nature of the work and we were very much in our craft to allow this to emerge in a steady and articulated way.
02:03:33	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I liked the extraordinary richness and diversity of frameworks, perspectives, and experience that emerged into a coherent thread informing what we might do next and why. I liked that this feels like legitimate governance / navigation - super consciously and thoughtfully examing where we are, patterns, what is next, and why.
02:03:33	Pete Kaminski:	I liked the sort of intense and robust discussion from a number of different people and perspectives.
02:03:34	Jason Schulist:	good conversation around structuring for complexity
02:03:35	Killu Sanborn:	Liked, continue: emergent insights, thoughtful understanding of where we are and what is needed, good listening, constructively and fast moving forward. Pete's comments to Jordan, the kindness and expansiveness how it left us, and Jordan's generous and immediate listening. Our different complementary viewpoints brought to any topic. And I really like all of you as people, and love spending time in the process of building something worthwhile from nothing to what feels like moving slowly but is really moving fast!
02:03:38	Marianne Wyne:	I liked the calm but vibrant energy i felt from the group. I like¬†how we continue to build on each others ideas, experience, suggestions, to take another move forward. I love how you all have taught me so much already and I'm excited for all the other learnings coming up - for all of us
02:04:01	Michael Grossman (Factr):	Liked the dialog, the voice/chat mix. Appreciated the continuing emergence of our efforts at roots-up connecting without top-down controlling.
02:04:24	Judith Benham:	Liked the flow and energy building.
02:04:40	Pete Kaminski:	"I Wish..."
02:06:51	Killu Sanborn:	I wish some of the people who were there in early meetings would rejoin and give feedback of what they see now. I wish we were clear in the many aligned interconnecting streams of value we are dealing with. I feel and intuit it but it needs to be clearly articulated and "sold" on the right levels, to quickly resource with best people, financing etc, as it has potential to be.
02:06:51	Wendy Elford:	There is a pattern behind this - is it time, psychological safety, a cadence of turn taking? It is  hard to put my finger on yet we all felt it.  I wish to know how to explain this to others as we all came up with a similar thing in what did we do well. Magic.
02:06:51	Judith Benham:	I wish we could do occasional breakout groups for dialog on topics.
02:06:51	Marianne Wyne:	I wish for us all that we continue to feel passionate about the work we are doing - 'cause that means we are on the right track. It will also be partly what attracts the people who are looking for us and who will join us to do this important work. I wish you all have a wonderful rest of your day ü•∞
02:06:51	Wendy McLean, NY:	I wish:‚Ä®* Jordan could be a participant and not have to facilitate, so he feels the flow of emergence differently; wish to hear his thoughts from this space.‚Ä®* The pattern created today could be a seed for future navigation meetings. ‚Ä®* to hear more from everyone about where the energy is moving most for them
02:06:52	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I wish we had a core team resourced to work on this full time. I wish we had a well resourced support structure to serve and empower the core functional areas that are needed for the body to structure itself. I wish I had $10M of philanthropic funding, and $10M of investment funding, to accomplish the first acquisitions and next stages and to resource and coordinate passionate teams in core functional areas.
02:06:53	Forrist Lytehaause:	Wish: I could expand the number of hours a day into the timeless... yet the paradox of being totally peaceful with the 24 hours that exist without an opportunity to change. Okay. Off topic but all that comes to mind right now. :-)
02:06:53	Michael Grossman (Factr):	I wish no one here (or, hell, anywhere) was competing for resources or recognition.
02:07:00	Jason Schulist:	I wish that we would have a structure/ritual for this meeting, clarity on what we are striving for, and stories to learn from related to that striving.  I wish we would share what has been acted upon in between meetings - what is the target condition for each one of us that aligns us toward our collective striving and what have we learned from that experiment.
02:08:23	Pete Kaminski:	"I Wonder" - what would happen if we...?
02:10:05	Killu Sanborn:	are we thinking big enough? and what would happen if we got wishes above, what would be different in how we see do think?
02:10:07	Forrist Lytehaause:	I wonder what would happen if the resources were available to move this into a dynamically growing ecosystem of regeneration, emerging at a pace that not constrained by financial resources.
02:10:08	Wendy Elford:	I wonder what would happen if we chose a subject that was really contentious or might be. So we have 20K USD how should we spend it now? How can we prioritise and how to we behave as we do this?
02:10:08	Wendy McLean, NY:	I wonder:‚Ä®* What will emerge for each of us over the next two weeks, as a ripple from our focus today on the groups that are emerging
02:10:09	Marianne Wyne:	I wonder what would happen if we could communicate EXTREMELY effectively? This is critical. There is so much I want to know about all the work happening in the Meta Project and we are just at the beginning. We need to get really good at this to be successful.
02:10:10	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	I wonder what would happen if - we actually believed it were possible and acted as if it were our responsibility to co-create the best possible future for all generations of life. Without for a second flinching or shying away from that highest overarching and uniting goal.
02:10:18	Jason Schulist:	I wonder what would happen if we create the conditions in this meeting for emergence to occur with a shared leadership model and a structure (that we would experiment with over time)...
02:10:19	Michael Grossman (Factr):	I wonder if everything we were doing was to support projects not in the room, we would feel more ease?
02:11:04	Judith Benham:	I wonder what would happen if we tried some oral updates from members on their key areas of interest & acton, and some discussion.
02:15:40	Pete Kaminski:	https://graham-boyd.biz/
02:18:25	Wendy Elford:	... follow the energy
02:20:21	Wendy Elford:	Other countries are like this too - Canada, Australia - something about harsh climates engender innovation
02:21:06	Michael Grossman (Factr):	You can punch very impactfully when you are able to punch in the armpit!
02:21:42	Michael Grossman (Factr):	(above your weight that is)
02:22:12	Pete Kaminski:	today's meeting notes: https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_community_information/meetings/meta_project_navigation,_2022-09-07
02:22:55	Marianne Wyne:	I propose we add the Scandinavian countries to this list of countries. It is so important that we build anti-fragile systems and I feel these countries have done a pretty good job at that.
02:23:26	Forrist Lytehaause:	reluctantly... time to depart.... with love and joy...
02:23:37	Wendy Elford:	see you Forrist
02:25:14	Jason Schulist:	i will be in the Balkans the following week so see you when i see you
