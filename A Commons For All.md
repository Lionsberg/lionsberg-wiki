# A Commons For All

The [[Receiver]] planned to Steward all [[Intellectual Property]], technology, systems, infrastructure, facilities, etc. "in common" for the good of [[All]]. 

This would require the co-creation of a legal [[Commons]] to protect and steward that which was being co-created for [[All]]. 

The Receiver's hypothesis was that the initial US 501(c)(3), in conjunction with the Creative Commons or a successor licensing system, could serve as a starting point for this stewardship of all that was Co-Created and held in common for All.
