Studies curated for the Receiver indicated that globally, approximately:

- Out of every 4 people, 1 lives every day without adequate clean water and sanitation. 
- Out of every 4 people, 1 lives every day without adequate shelter to keep them safe, warm and dry. 
- Out of every 5 people, the development of 1 is stunted because they do not have enough basic food and nutrients. 
- Out of every 5 people, 1 has had no formal education at all. 
- Out of every 6 people, 1 lives in poverty. 
- X out of 10 people lived in ongoing fear of violence and lack basic physical and psychological safety  
- X out of 10 people lacked access to basic systems of justice  

Related studies revealed that in far too many cases, these conditions of poverty and deprivation were the result of corrupt and illegitimate authority exploiting local populations for their own positions and power. 

It appeared that in many cases, the [[Power]] of the strong depended on the [[Poverty]] and [[Exploitation]] of the weak.
