# Core Enterprise

The [[Core Enterprise]] was conceived as one team of teams comprised of the best resources from [[Group Of Groups]]. 

While the [[Program and Process Management Guild]] and and the [[Small Groups]] each have direct responsibilities to the [[Receiver]] as outlined in their [[Agreements]], they have collectively understood that integration and synthesis of ideas before recommendations are made to the [[Receiver]] is true to the spirit of integrated delivery. 

Each of the IPD Teams / [[Small Groups]] contributes various resources to the [[Core Enterprise]]. Because the Core Enterprise is essentially "overhead" to the operations of the distributed network of [[Group Of Groups]], the PM will continually undertake the appropriate series of "right-sizing" resource efforts to bring only necessary resources and disciplines to the [[Core Enterprise]]. 

The CE should also include representatives of all stakeholder groups, as well as wise council and consultants across various domains of insight and expertise.

The [[Core Enterprise]] can be thought of as a central executive, leadership, and coordination element of the [[Federation]].

As such, it should learn from the central coordinating bodies of various federations such as the United States, Mondragon, the European Union, the United Nations, and other similar federal bodies.

It bears repeating, that this organization should remain as small as practical to accomplish its functions, and that the functions assigned to it by the [[Receiver]] should remain as few as are practical.

Among other responsibilities, the Core Enterprise will participate in continuously improving and clarifying the [[Meta Project Program Statement]], the wisdom and design of [[The Prototype]], the quality of the deployment [[Infrastructure]], and the quality of this [[Lionsberg System]].  

#### The Structure of the Core Enterprise
The Core Enterprise is not designed to abrogate the [[Individual And Local]] responsibilities of the[[Small Groups]] or other members of the [[Federation]], but rather to provide an umbrella of talented resources to help and empower the decentralized array of autonomous teams, and to consolidate and reflect back out to the [[Federation]] its collective progress and learnings.

It also acts as an advisory group that vets and further develops recommendations of the PM from multiple perspectives before they are forwarded to the [[Receiver]] / Servant Leader of the [[Core Enterprise]].
