# Groups

To accomplish things they cannot do in isolation, Individuals [[Organize and Federate]] into [[Groups]].  

Small, effective groups and teams are the basis of execution in the System. Small groups, generally of 3 to 20, are the core nodes of community, life, and action in the [[LIONSBERG System]].  

Groups inalienably possess all inherent [[Rights And Responsibilities]] of [[Individuals]] via the [[Individuals]] that compose them.  

Each Group should do their best to [[Co-Operation|Co-Operate]] a [[Group Instance]] of the [[LIONSBERG System]] to help them discover and achieve the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] while advancing towards their [[Aim]]. 

The [[Group Instance]] is critical to ensuring that the Whole has Integrity, as a result of the Core System Components co-operating with [[Integrity]] at every [[Fractal]] level. 

To accomplish things they cannot do on their own, [[Groups]] [[Organize and Federate]] by forming [[Sub Groups]] and [[Super Groups]].  

In general, Groups: 

- Have a defined Aim / Goal  
- Have responsibility and authority in a [[Domain]]  
- Have defined [[Roles]]  
- Process and Solve [[Issues]]  
- Make decisions based on [[Discernment]] and [[Consent]]  
- Have [[Links]] to other [[Groups]] that produce energy and information flow, and alignment.
