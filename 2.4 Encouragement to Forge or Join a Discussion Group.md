# 2.4 Encouragement to Forge or Join a Discussion Group

The New Vision and Plan outlined in this book is a comprehensive and ambitious plan that will require the cooperation and commitment of governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals around the world. In order to achieve this, it is important to foster a culture of dialogue, collaboration, and participation.

One of the most powerful ways to do this is by forming or joining a [[Discussion Group]]. A discussion group can be a powerful tool for learning, organizing, and taking action. It can provide a space for individuals to come together and share their knowledge, experiences, and ideas, and to learn from one another. By working together, a group can achieve more than any individual acting alone.

A discussion group can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a community or even a nation. The key is that it is a space for open and honest dialogue, where diverse perspectives are welcomed and encouraged. It is important that the group is inclusive and that all members actively create a space in which all members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, ideas, and concerns.

In addition to fostering open dialogue and collaboration, a discussion group can also be a powerful tool for organizing and taking action. It can be a space where individuals can come together to plan and coordinate actions that support the New Vision and Plan. The group can also serve as a platform for sharing resources, information, and tools, and for supporting and encouraging one another as we work towards our shared goal of creating a better future for all. Many groups that start as discussion groups end up transforming into [[Action Group|Action Groups]] based on the shared interests, passions, and opportunities uncovered through [[Dialogue]]. 

We encourage you to form or join a discussion group, and to use this space to learn, organize, and take action. Together, we can create a more loving, just, and regenerative world for all.
