# Selves

Selves with a capital "S" refers to our [[True Self]], our Highest Selves, That Which We Are Becoming, and That Which Is Guiding The Subsequent Transformation Of Our Selves Over Time. 

It is distinguished from our lower [[False Self]], which we are transcending and which is passing away along with the [[Old]].
