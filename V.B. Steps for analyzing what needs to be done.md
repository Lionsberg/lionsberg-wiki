# V.B. Steps for analyzing what needs to be done

Conducting a thorough analysis of existing forces and conditions, and what needs to be done to transform them, is a critical step in ensuring that everyone is working together effectively towards our shared goals and objectives. The following steps can be used as guidelines for conducting effective analysis:

1.  Define the problem or challenge: Clearly define the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed, and ensure that everyone has a shared understanding of the problem or challenge.
    
2.  Gather information: Gather information and data about the problem or challenge, and about the current Reality. The current Reality is like the starting the point of the quest towards the Vision. This includes understanding the current forces and conditions bearing upon the Reality or situation to be transformed. This may include conducting surveys, conducting interviews, conducting new research, and reviewing existing data and research.
    
3.  Analyze the information: Analyze the information that has been gathered, and use that analysis to develop a clear understanding of the current Reality, including the challenges and opportunities that exist, and the forces and conditions that must be resolved or transformed in order for the Vision to become Reality.
    
4.  Identify root causes: Identify the root causes of the problem, challenge, or existing Reality, and consider the relationships between root causes and the broader context. Use a [[Systems Thinking]] approach to evaluate all elements as if they were part of a single system producing the outcomes. 
    
5.  Develop hypotheses: Based on the information gathered and analyzed, develop a hypothetical plan for addressing the problem or challenge, and for advancing towards our shared goals and objectives.
    
6.  Evaluate the plan: As you get into subsequent changes, continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the plan and its fit to Reality, and make changes as needed. Ensure that everyone is working together effectively, and that everyone's efforts are aligned with one another.
    
7.  Continuously improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the analysis process, and ensure that everyone is working together effectively towards a better shared understanding of the existing forces, conditions, and Reality.
    

By following these steps, individuals, teams, organizations, and communities can ensure that they have a clear understanding of the current Reality and the challenges and opportunities that exist, so that they can work together in a sophisticated and nuanced Way towards shared goals and objectives. Analysis is an essential component of the Lionsberg System, and is critical for ensuring that everyone is working together in an informed, wise, and effective way towards shared goals and objectives.
