# 2.12 Intrapreneurship vs. Entrepreneurship - Federating Everything

The LIONSBERG System is designed to emerge holofractally through bounded ecosystems and commons in which we continually [[Federate Everything]]. 

While any individual or circle playing The Great Game is sovereign and therefore free to "take" an idea, "leave" the game, and "go out" to pursue an idea "on their own", we know that the real Value and Potential lies not merely in our individual efforts, but in the Synergies and Relationships among us. It is a fundamental violation of the core values of LIONSBERG and The Game to compete with the other players of The Game. 

>_We collaborate internally so that we can compete externally with the antithetical systems._ 

This is the core difference between Intrapreneurship — continually innovating and developing within the federated and united context of the ONE Body — and entrepreneurship — "going out" to functionally compete with everyone and everything including the players of The Game. 

Because we are co-creating ONE Future as ONE Body, Our Aim is to build an ecosystem of multi-generational interconnected relationships and trust, where we are confident that any ideas and "intellectual property" (as it was called in the false paradigm of the Old World) that are expressed into The Commons are cultivated and developed In Community for the Good of All. This ensures that as a cultural norm and Value, whatever gets built gets federated, so that We and our Successors All have an equal stake in the overall multi-generational Value we are co-creating by playing The Game. 

Please — [[Federate Everything]].
