# 10.1 The concept of the Quest for the best and highest Destiny

The Quest for the Best and Highest Destiny refers to the journey towards a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. This quest is driven by the desire to co-create a world where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to flourish, and where the well-being of the planet and all its inhabitants is prioritized. It is a call to action for individuals, communities, and organizations to come together and progress towards a worthy shared vision and goal.

The Quest is built on the belief that humanity has the potential to co-create a future that can be good beyond our wildest dreams, but that this will require a fundamental transformation of our current systems and ways of thinking. It is a call to move beyond the limitations of current approaches and to embrace new ways of thinking, planning, and acting that are capable of addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis.

The Quest is not just about addressing the problems of the present, but also about the eternal process of co-creating a better future for all subsequent generations of life on Earth. It is about co-creating a world that is regenerative, free and just for all. It is about transcending the current paradigms of economic growth, individual success, and political power, and aligning with a New Paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet.

The Quest for the Best and Highest Destiny is a journey that requires courage, commitment, and collaboration. It is an invitation to join a rising movement of individuals, communities, and organizations who are ready to take action and work together to co-create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.
