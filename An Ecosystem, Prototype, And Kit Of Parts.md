# An Ecosystem, Prototype, And Kit Of Parts

The planning details for the [[Systems, Facilities, Services, And Infrastructure (SFSI)]] would be iteratively developed and reviewed, in order to co-create an adaptive ecosystem of resources that connect, empower, and strengthen the diverse expression and resiliency of sovereign local communities, while retaining [[Interoperability]] among the diverse elements. 

For this reason, the [[SFSI]] designs would be developed based on a conceptual [[Prototype]], constructed as a [[Kit of Parts]], that could be selectively and interoperably adapted and deployed based on local realities and needs. 

The [[Current Best Understanding]] of how the [[Kit of Parts]] could best function would be to maintain all parts in an integrated conceptual [[Prototype]], that would be continuously improved based on the learnings from each [[Instantiation]].
