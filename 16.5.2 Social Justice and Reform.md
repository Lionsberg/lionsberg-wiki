# 16.5.2 Social Justice and Reform

The New Vision and Plan recognizes that unjust and unenlightened social systems and structures have contributed to the Meta Crisis and perpetuated discrimination, marginalization, oppression, and unnecessary human and environmental suffering. Therefore, it prioritizes the creation of just and enlightened social systems and structures that promote justice, equality, and fairness for all. This includes addressing all forms of discrimination on the basis of group, category, and class, as well as the fundamental reform of social systems such as education, healthcare, conflict resolution, and criminal justice.

It also includes the dismantling of social, economic, and political structures that uphold and maintain the status quo of power imbalances. The New Vision and Plan focuses on creating inclusive and just systems that uplift marginalized communities, and prioritize the well-being and dignity of all individuals. This includes reforms that address issues such as access to education, healthcare, and housing, as well as the creation of citizen led social safety nets that provide for the basic needs of all members of society. Additionally, it prioritizes the development of community-based solutions and local self-governance, which empowers individuals and communities to address their own specific needs and circumstances. To facilitate this, it proposes redefining the roles of the core institutions of society, and returning resources and power away from historic centers of accumulation and back to the people.
