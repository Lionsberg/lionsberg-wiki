# Future Generations

"Future Generations" refers to the humans and non-humans who will be born and live in the years and centuries to come. In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], consideration for future generations is an essential guiding principle that shapes decision-making, policies, and practices.

This forward-looking perspective is grounded in a deep sense of responsibility, stewardship, and intergenerational justice. The actions and choices made today have far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to prioritize the well-being and needs of future generations alongside those of the present, and when necessary to sacrifice in the present to ensure prosperity and wellbeing in the Future. 

By considering the impact of our decisions on future generations, the Lionsberg System fosters regenerative development, long-term thinking, and an enduring commitment to preserving the health of society, the planet and the well-being of all its inhabitants. This principle encourages the community to be mindful of the legacy it leaves behind and to work collaboratively towards creating a world that supports the flourishing of all life, both now and in the future.

Key concepts related to this principle include [[Sustainability]], [[Regenerativity]], [[Right Relationship]], and [[Higher Order Functional Unity]], which emphasize the interconnectedness of all life across time and space, and the importance of living in harmony with the natural world and each other.
