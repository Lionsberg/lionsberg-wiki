# Lionsberg Intellectual Content System

The Lionsberg Intellectual Content System is emerging in response to the spiritual and moral imperative to establish New ways of cultivating, protecting, and preserving the universal collective inheritance of Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom. 

The beginning of the Lionsberg Intellectual Content System was publishing via the Lionsberg Wiki under theÂ [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and making all content available in the [[Lionsberg Commons]]. 

The [[Lionsberg Roadmap]] calls for transcending this initial structure into a fully articulated System to wisely steward with our collective inheritance of Data, Information, Knowledge, Ideas and Wisdom.
