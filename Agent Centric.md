# Agent Centric

_A perspective or approach that emphasizes the role, experiences, and motivations of individual agents within a system. In the context of systems design, this can mean designing systems that orient around the behaviors and interactions of individual agents within a larger system, while providing mechanisms understanding how their actions influence and are influenced by the system as a whole._ (Open Civics)
