# A New Vision, Intention, Philosophy, and Program of Action

The Receiver recognized that it would need to rise above the [[Chaos]] and articulate a [[New]] [[Vision]], [[Intention]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Program of Action]] that had the pragmatic potential to accomplish the Goal. 

This Intention, Philosophy, and Program of Action would need to get out ahead of the accelerating [[Science]] and [[Technology]], in order to harness it and [[Aim]] it on behalf of [[All]] towards the [[Meta Goal]]. 

The Receiver would then create a [[Integrated Delivery System]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] into [[Reality]].
