# Universal Rights

Recognizing the inherent dignity, worth, and Value of [[All]] as members of [[One Family]] of Life, a basic list of [[Universal Rights]] can be articulated, which flow from the [[Universal Law]] and [[Universal Values]] derived from the [[Logos]] of the Universe. 

These Rights are distinct from the [[Universal Aspirations]], which are not guaranteed, but rather are the [[Ideal]] we are striving towards.

## These Universal Rights Are Not Manifest in the Old World

While this articulation reasonably represents the basic rights and freedoms that a heart of Love would desire for one it Loves, we have struggled to operationalize them. 

In every country of the world, we find massive inequalities, corruption and unequal treatment in society and law, and percentage of society struggling for survival, let alone flourishing. 

Clearly, despite our progress, the way we are organizing and governing our Selves is not causing the fruits of joy, justice, and abundance to rain down upon All. 

## What Kind Of Society Could Guarantee Such Rights? 

The question again returns to what kind of a Society could guarantee such rights? 

If we All desire those rights and freedoms, and desire them for All, what kind of a Society would we have to design and build such that those rights and freedoms could manifest for All? 

And what kind of Way would we need to Co-Operate such that every being on earth had the genuine freedom and opportunity to develop in an environment and society in which they could realize the fullness of their unique potential as part of a harmonious and familial Whole?
