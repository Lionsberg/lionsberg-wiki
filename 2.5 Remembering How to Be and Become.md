# 2.5 Remembering How to Be and Become

After generations upon generations of life in [[The Caves]], it is important to remember that the most important thing we are here on [[Earth]] to do is to *become* the fullness of Who we were each uniquely created to be, by helping All others do the same. 

We cannot co-create [[Heaven On Earth]] without [[Becoming]] the kinds of people for whom that [[New World]] is a lived and embodied Reality.  

So the first thing to *do*, is to relax and to *be*. Together. In Community. Getting to know One Another. Building Relationship. Helping One Another Heal, Transform, and Become who we are each uniquely created to Be.

This is perhaps the central and most important [[Work]].
