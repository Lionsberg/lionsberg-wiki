# Meta Solution

[[Meta Solution]] refers to a comprehensive, systemic, and collaborative approach to addressing the complex and interconnected challenges that humanity and the [[Living System]] are facing, collectively known as the [[Meta Crisis]]. The Meta Solution acknowledges that many individual and local crises are symptoms of deeper root causes and systemic drivers, which require an integrative, comprehensive, and holistic response.
