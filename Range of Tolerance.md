# Range of Tolerance

In the context of the [[Lionsberg System]], the "Range of Tolerance" refers to the ability of individuals and groups to accept and accommodate differing ideas, perspectives, and approaches within the collective effort to create the [[New World]], provided that they remain within mutually acceptable boundaries. Recognizing that Co-Creators come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, the Range of Tolerance emphasizes the importance of embracing diversity and cooperation in pursuit of our shared [[Vision]].

The Range of Tolerance encourages Co-Creators to:

1.  Respect and value the unique contributions and perspectives of others.
2.  Encourage open dialogue and the free exchange of ideas.
3.  Be willing to listen to, understand, and learn from alternative viewpoints.
4.  Strive for inclusivity and collaboration in decision-making processes as we work towards [[Consent]] and [[Consensus]] in our [[Decision Making]] processes.
5.  Recognize that multiple approaches and solutions can coexist and contribute to the collective effort.

By fostering a healthy Range of Tolerance, the Lionsberg System cultivates an environment where diverse perspectives are celebrated and leveraged to enhance our collective intelligence, creativity, and innovation. This inclusive approach to problem-solving and decision-making helps ensure that we are better equipped to navigate the complexities of Crossing The Chasm and co-creating the [[New World]].
