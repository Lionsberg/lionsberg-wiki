# 2. Trigger Warning

We understand that thinking through the [[Meta Crisis]] and the necessary changes to co-create a [[Brighter Future]] can be overwhelming and potentially triggering for some individuals. We acknowledge that people come from a diverse array of backgrounds, and that many people have experienced trauma, injustice, and oppression in various forms, and that discussions of these issues can bring up painful emotions and memories. 

We also understand that discussing the deepest and most important aspects of our existence, especially issues related to spirituality, religion, God, governance, and politics can trigger immediate discomfort and defenses. 

The Lionsberg Story, System, and Game are independent of ideology, and are intended to help humanity rediscover the vision, values, goals, and aspirations that unite us. In a world divided by ideology and offense, we recognize that this approach will cause an initial reaction of fear in each bubble of culture, however we trust that truth and wisdom will prevail and enable us to hear each other's heart and intention beyond the different words we might use to express our shared desire for all generations of life to flourish in harmony. 

If you ever feel triggered or overwhelmed during a Lionsberg event, or reading or listening to content that Lionsberg or [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is publishing, please know that you are not alone. Our community is committed to supporting each other and creating a compassionate and understanding environment. We encourage you to reach out with questions or concerns. We will do our best to prioritize and respond to [[Frequently Asked Questions]] on an ongoing basis. 

We extend our love, compassion, and appreciation to all citizens who are engaged in our shared effort to co-create a just, regenerative, prosperous, and flourishing world for all. We acknowledge the hurt, traumas, abuses, fears and divisions of our individual and collective past, and we encourage every participant to humbly, openly, and compassionately work together to design and build [[The Future]] we all long for.
