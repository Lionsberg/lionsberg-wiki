# Flexibility And Compatibility

Any form of Structure can be made compatible with the [[LIONSBERG System]] through the use of Voluntary [[Agreements]]. 

For example, even a group of physicians, attorneys, or other licensed professionals who are prohibited from co-operating in a [[Stewardship Structure]] can [[Act As If]] they were operating on the basis of Federated Stewardship by Integrating themselves with the System through [[Agreements]].  

There is nothing that prevents any individual, circle, tribe, state, nation or association from voluntarily choosing to play the Meta Game.  

Over time, _many_ different structures of _many_ different types will need to [[Organize and Federate]] in order for us to accomplish [[The Goal]].
