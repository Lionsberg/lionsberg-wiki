# Program Services And Support

Successful Program Delivery will require a total suite of services and support, collectively [[Systems, Facilities, Services, And Infrastructure (SFSI)]], to meet the needs and solve the problems inherent to Small Group and Community of Life. 

These services and support will be coordinated through the [[Core Enterprise]] and its constituent elements.Â  

This will include technology, financial management, operational management, cultural management, administration, dispute resolution and necessary reporting and communication, both internally among IPD Teams, and outwardly to the [[Whole]].
