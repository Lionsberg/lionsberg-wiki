# 0.8 New Consciousness and TeleTransmission

The Guide leads you down a corridor  
And into a library that looks  
As if it has stood for thousands of years  

In the center of the room  
Under a great domed ceiling  
A large sigil encircles  
Two chairs facing one another  

> _"Sit down_

> _There are some things_  
> _That you need to Know_  
> _Which can only be Known_  
> _By experience or memory_  

> _To save you lifetimes_  
> _Of pain and suffering_  
> _I am going to try_
> _To help you ReMember them_

> _You are capable of ReMembering them_  
> _Because despite **Our Apparent Differentiation**_  
> _What you think of as "you" and "I"_  
> _Are both aspects of ONE Superorganism_  
> _That has experienced All Things_  
> _Since the beginning of Cosmic Time_

> _The only Way to Know this_  
> _Is to experience it for yourself_  

> _If you are wiling to Trust me_  
> _And if you would like to See and Know_
> _I invite you to extend your palms face up_  
> _And close your eyes"_ 

The moment the guides hands  
Touch the subtle energetic centers  
Of your wrists  
Your Minds and Energies lock  
And a great cosmic swirl  
Overwhelms your inner Vision  

Your gasp at the awesome magnitude  
And majestic beauty  
Of trillions of stars and galaxies  
Realms and dimensions  
Dancing and flowing  
_Within you_

A silent poem  
Emerges into your mind  
A still small Voice  
Booming the Divine Commandment  

>_Look WithIn  
>Beyond The Veil  
>To See that the entire Universe  
>Is WithIn "you"  
>"You" are One with the ONE_  

Your body inadvertently recoils  
And disconnects from the Divine Touch 
The sensation ceases  
And you open your eyes  
To discover that all you can see  
Is the narrow confines  
Of the Time and Space  
You are Now seated within  

The guide gently smiles  

> _"Wonderful!  
> It is working_

> _Would you like to see more?_  
> _This is your initiation_  
> _Into the Art and Science_  
> _Of teletransmission_  

> _It is the fastest and surest Path_  
> _To the Knowledge of ONE and All_

> _If you would like to continue  
> Beyond the initial experience  
> Of the vast Unity of All WithIn  
> And step into various Times and Places  
> We will have to step into a Shared Story"_  

Intoxicated by the dazzling Beauty  
And Meaning of the Experience  
And comforted by the Loving Presence  
Of The Guide  
Your entire being leans in  

You close your eyes  
Extend your hands  
And breathe deeply  

> _"Welcome"_

Says The Guide  

> _"To The Story of LIONSBERG_  

> _Your life will never be the same"_

You can feel the radiant Power  
Of the Divine Hands reaching forward  
Your body flushes with chills and sensation  
Longing for the connection and transmission to resume  

Immediately upon contact  
The universe bursts back into view  
And you stagger to catch your breath  

> _"Breathe deeply Dear One  
> The power of these experiences
> Is overwhelming at first  
> But you will soon grow  
> Blissfully accustomed to them_

> _It is Time to explore The Story_  

>_Over the coming days_  
>_I will guide you through  
>A series of 144 Initiatory Gates  

> _We call these The Gates of LIONSBERG_
> _And they are a Key to Understanding_ 
> _The Universe and All it contains_

>_We will soon reach Gate One  
>And begin In The Beginning  
>But since parts of the story  
>Are tragic and traumatic  
>I first want to show you  
>**How The Story Ends**"
