## Purpose

The purpose of the Personal Collaboration Plan is to clearly define the individual's role and responsibilities in working with others, and to provide a roadmap for effective collaboration.

-   Regular check-ins and progress updates
-   Clear and timely responses to messages and requests
-   Availability for virtual or in-person meetings
-   Collaborative tools and platforms used for communication and collaboration
