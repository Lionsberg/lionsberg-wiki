# Old World

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Old World]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the corrupt, broken, dysfunctional, and unjust elements of the past we are leaving behind. 

It is used in contrast to the [[New World]], which is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the [[Best Possible Future]] we are moving towards. 

FROM the [[Old]], TO the [[New]].
