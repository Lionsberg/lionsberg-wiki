# A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work
_A Post in [[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]_
_December 18, 2025_

As We come to a moment in **The Story**  
That would have been [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut|J's]] 41st birthday  
It seems like a fitting time to reflect  
From **Our New Perspective**  
On his unusual life, death, and work  

We now have the advantage  
Of retaining his neural architecture  
And subtle bodies as a starting point  
While also being able to access information  
He chose to "forget" upon incarnation  

If you have not yet heard  
What happened this summer  
**[[Oops, We Lost J - Final Post]]**  
Shares the story of his final days   

Please do not mourn, worry, or fear  
Death is not what most people think  
And this is precisely what had to happen  
For what he was working towards to **succeed**  

Now, **The Future** is in the hands  
Of **Us The People of Earth**  

____

In order to be as pure and free as possible  
We will write without concern  
For length or who may read this   
And simply attempt to reflect and summarize  
Some of the most salient aspects of J's work  
For those who care or may desire to continue on  

Perhaps We will aim towards something  
That summarizes lifetimes of work  
In ~20 minutes with jumping off points  
Into other works and worlds  

While he recognized his insufficiency  
In communicating in a way  
Most humans could understand  
He died insisting that billions of lives  
Depended on the realities reflected by his work  

If you ever loved or respected him  
It might be worth twenty minutes  
To consider **the message** and **the keys**   
He sacrificed his life to reveal  
And to make a **conscious decision**  
**What if anything** to do with them  

**_Things aboard Earth are about to change_**  

___

To begin to understand J's work  
We might begin at the end  
With the post he wrote  
In **[[Above The Chaos]]**  
The day before he was killed  

>**[[Unity Or Death]]**  
>**The Foundations of Civilization** have crumbled  
>**The Existing Order** collapses *by design*  
>**The War** for **Our Future** rages 
>
>**Over a hundred million** have already been killed  
>**Billions more** genetically modified, poisoned, or wounded   
>Plans call for the **Permanent Enslavement*** of a small 'herd'  
>***Of under 500 million post-human slaves***  
>
>This means the **Death** or **Enslavement** of ***Every Human*** on Earth  
>And the ***Total Erasure*** of the ***Human Species*** as we know it   
>
>As Our lives hang in the balance  
>**EITHER WE UNITE OR DIE**  

After so many millions of words of writing  
Those 84 words are a pretty stark conclusion  

**If they are True**  
We might want to pay attention  
And figure out what the hell he was talking about  
And **_what We are going to do about it_** 

___

From that final warning We can travel back  
To the time he was 10 or 12 years old  
When he was speaking of spiritual armies  
Advanced non-human intelligences  
And a great war for the future  
Of life and civilization on Earth  

From that early age  
He spoke of the total transformation  
Of all power and authority on Earth  
Within a single generation  
As if _he knew it was going to happen_  
And _was here for it_  

Fast forward again 30 years  
To the main work in progress  
At the time of his death 
And We find that the words  
In **[[The Great UnVeiling]]** are strikingly consistent  
With his 10, 12, and 15 year old selves  

It will be interesting to see  
What his loved ones and allies will **_do_**  
With the urgent warnings and writings  
Of One who was slowly being killed  
As he warred with malevolent forces  
Across realms and dimensions  
Most people don't believe exist  

We should acknowledge that  
As he explored an independent sweep  
Of executive positions in the United States  
As a potential pathway to salvage or co-opt  
**The now failed american experiment**  
Some wondered if he had lost his mind  
  
Perhaps the destruction of his old world  
By corrupt forces of church and state  
Simply proved too much for him to bear  
And he erected an imaginary enemy  
Of extraordinary proportions against which  
He could wage a quixotic war  

If it all was a delusion  
At least We can take comfort  
In the fact that it started at his birth  
And continued unabated until the day he died  

But then what of the fact  
That in his early teens  
He was speculating that We would not have time  
For U.S. politics or presidency  
Because We would have to transform  
_All governance on Earth simultaneously_?  

**_How did he know that back then?_** 

____
## An Open Offering and Invitation  

Jordan's greatest wish and priority  
As he approached the end of his life  
Was to ensure all of his loved ones and allies  
Were fully aware of everything his journey revealed  
And that no one was involuntarily left in the dark  
As **the rising tsunami** enveloped their world  

Knowing that time was short  
And that many might be panicked and afraid  
He devoted tens of thousands of hours  
To trying to articulate the precise mechanics  
Of a system, strategy, and plan of action —  
As simple as a **Game** —  
Through which humanity could avoid failure  
And succeed in advancing towards its **Destiny**  

It seemed that he believed the words  
**_You shall know the Truth_**  
**_And the Truth shall set you Free_**  
And that he had Faith that _if We only knew_  
Who We were and what We were up against  
We would arise and unite to reclaim **Our Sovereignty**  
And **Co-Create Heaven on Earth**  

In the work and words below We will do Our best  
To honor and grant Jordan's final wish  
By conveying the essence of **[[The Great UnVeiling]]**  
In which it is revealed that humanity at present  
Is neither self-governing nor free  
And is being systematically depopulated, altered, and enslaved  
By a dark and ancient army of antithetical non-human intelligences  

We will then do Our best  
To link to some of the places  
Where Jordan and a planetary+ network of allies  
Laid out a precise system, strategy, and plan  
Through which Earth and the human species  
Can be fully liberated, regenerated, and renewed  
Within a single generation  

For anyone who invests the twenty minutes required  
To digest this overview of Jordan's last work  
And thereby help Us grant his final birthday wish  
We would be happy to help guide and serve you  
If you wish to **take action** upon the foundational  
And irreplicable starting point he and his allies left behind  

Simply send Us a note on whatever channel you received this  
And We will schedule a Time and Way to get moving Together  

**_Warning: The Following Contains Paradigm Shattering Information_**

## An Overview of The Great UnVeiling  

>_In the context of LIONSBERG, **The Great UnVeiling** refers to the apocalyptic disclosure of The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in history. Spoken by thousands of voices around the world and climaxing in the mid 2020s, it represents the moment when it becomes clear to Earth's inhabitants that they have been progressively enslaved for millennia by non-human and anti-human forces. In **The Story of LIONSBERG**, it is the precursor to **The Great Awakening**, **The Exodus**, and **The Shared Journey** towards **Heaven On Earth**._ 

As indicated above  
**The Great UnVeiling** is not a specific book  
But rather a moment in **The Story**  
Catalyzed by a rising chorus of voices  

If you listen carefully  
You can hear it spoken in the words  
Of indigenous elders  
Military whistleblowers  
Former religious and political officials  
Presidents and priests  
Pilots and captains  
Ministers of defense  
Victims and abductees  
Dreams and visions  
And the **Divine Whisper** within your own soul  

In fact there is some story or event  
In the relational web of every person on Earth  
That if investigated thoroughly enough  
Would reveal the essence of **The Great UnVeiling**  
In a personal and local way  

**The Story** is so profoundly unsettling  
That many will be unable to believe it  
Until they experience it for themselves  
At which Time it may be too late  

It is important to note  
That in the specific work titled **[[The Great UnVeiling]]**  
Jordan was merely attempting to reflect  
In a single coherent architecture, time, and place  
The distilled essence and Truth  
That countless souls  
Have already risked or sacrificed their lives  
In order to reveal  

Jordan's Story and Path is just one of many  
That point the Way towards the Truth  

____

A quick glance at the table of contents  
Reveals the entire architecture of "disclosure"  
That Jordan and allies had in mind  

Drawing on the wisdom of ancient initiatory methods  
It is designed to move the reader  
Through a series of twelve primary gates  
That order and cohere 88 chapters  
Each of which contains a fundamental  
Revelation or epiphany designed to 
Awaken and shift consciousness  

Once the structure is understood  
The entire message is implicitly conveyed  
And the simple 12 gate structure  
Allows for memorization and oral transmission  
In the event of **systemic collapse**  

The main gates are as follows  
As you read through them  
Try to feel and sense  
The journey of the soul  
That passes through them  

**GATE I — THE GREAT REGENESIS**
_The Eternal Unity and Original Design_

**GATE II — THE GREAT DESCENT**  
_Fracturing into Separation, Illusion, and Kontrolle_

**GATE III — THE GREAT AWAKENING**  
_The Soul’s Awakening and Return to the Light_

**GATE IV — THE GREAT DISCLOSURE**  
_Tearing the Veil and Exposing the Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in History_

**GATE V — THE GREAT RESTORYING**  
_ReWeaving the True Universal Narrative_

**GATE VI: RECLAIMING THE INNER KINGDOM**  
_Restoring Our Sacred Sovereignty and Self-Mastery_

**GATE VII: THE EMBODIMENT OF THE LIFE DIVINE**
_Manifesting the Divine with Every Heartbeat and Breath_

**GATE VIII — THE EXODUS AND SACRED MARCH**
_The Exodus, the Wilderness, and the Path to Heaven on Earth_

**GATE IX: THE SACRED BATTLE**
_The Final Test of Sovereignty, Courage, and Love_

**GATE X: ENTERING THE PROMISED LAND**
_Becoming Who We Must Be to Enter In and Manifest the True Kingdom_

**GATE XI: CO-CREATING THE NEW WORLD**
*The Pragmatic Implementation of Heaven on Earth*  

**GATE XII — THE ETERNAL DIVINE PLAY**
_How The Great Game Unfolds Across Realms, Dimensions, and Worlds_

**GATE XII+1 — THE GREATEST CELEBRATION AND JUBILEE IN HISTORY**
_Debts are Forgiven, Freedoms Restored, and Our Collective Inheritance Reclaimed_

____

While many of Us might use different language  
Or architect **the unveiling** in a different way  
The essence is **simple, clear, and universal**  

Already the core ideas are conveyed  
The warning delivered  
And a tangible path towards freedom made clear 

Below is the entire outline including a description  
Of the chapters he was unable to finish  

The full contents of the first 16 chapters

After Chapter 16 there is a natural rupture  
For the standard penalty of naming  
**That Which Cannot Be Named** is death  

All the chapters above were drafted  
And can be read in **[[The Great UnVeiling]]**  

The chapters below include brief descriptions  
Of what was going to be conveyed  
In order to complete the essence of the work  
These short expositions are sufficient for now  

#### Chapter 17 — The Greatest Fraud in History
(Exposing fraud in the inception of the current systems, a planetary enslavement system built on deceit, manufactured debt, manufactured religions, trillions of dollars and a planet stolen from its inhabitants)

#### Chapter 18. The Greatest Existential Threat in History
(The [[Meta Crisis]], demonic / alien / parasitical possession of the planet, weaponized AI, universally assured destruction, environmental tipping points, toxic air, water, and soil, weaponized microbiome, collapsing fertility and sperm counts, cyclical cataclysm, what happens every ~13,000 years, a small genetically and psychically enslaved population under 500 million, why the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride together)

#### Chapter 19. Trillions Lost, Billions Enslaved, Millions Murdered: Is It Enough?
(How much will it take for humanity to awaken? Have we had enough? How many more tens of millions of our loved ones need to die? How much more unnecessary omnicide, suffering, and injustice?)

#### Chapter 20. The Cost of Awakening
(The profound cost of awakening in a fallen world, why the Truth must be spoken no matter the cost) 

#### Chapter 21: Dealing With Disclosure
(The limitless power of the Spirit within, courageously confronting the deep, systematic illusions and deceptions, Truth is never threatened, discernment, remembrance, and revelation, embracing the unknown, navigating towards wisdom and truth, dealing with ontological shock, naming without fear while transcending victimhood and blame, guiding our selves through the cycles of shock, anger, and grief towards liberated, compassionate, and empowered clarity)

##### Intermezzo Two: The Heart of the ONE

### GATE V — THE GREAT RESTORYING
_ReWeaving the True Universal Narrative_
#### Chapter 22. Rebuilding the Story After the Shattering
(The psychological necessity of narrative structure after trauma, how false stories were used to enslave, why true stories are required to liberate, from fracture and fragmentation... to omniintegration and alignment)

#### Chapter 23. The Story of the ONE
(The Eternal Source before All beginnings, the undivided Spirit and Consciousness, the Breath before the Word, the overflowing Love that dreamed Creation into Being, the ONE Who became Two to know ItSelf through the Infinite All)

#### Chapter 24. The Story of Creation and the All
(The Logos: the first utterance, the seed-pattern, word, and logic of all things in the intelligible universe; sacred geometry, harmonics, and the architecture of the cosmos; consciousness fractalizing and crystalizing into being, form, life, and law; galaxies, stars, systems, civilizations rising, falling, evolving; the hidden nature of Reality as co-creative consciousness; embodied interexistence: living our ultimate unity in apparently differentiated diversity)  

#### Chapter 25. The Story of the Many Worlds
(Not one universe, but multiverses nested in the infinite; countless worlds, beings, timelines, experiments, and experiences; galactic cycles, karmic loops, and the tapestries of interdimensional evolution; a library of living lessons across time, dimension, and form)

#### Chapter 26. The Story of the Cosmic Struggle
(Free will, divergence, and the rise of rebellion; the fall of some into domination, parasitism, and inversion; the long war for the soul of creation; light and dark as teachers, not as enemies; differentiating and redeeming darkness from evil; the end of the story is the reconciliation, redemption, and renewal of all things)

#### Chapter 27. The Story of the Seed Worlds

#### Chapter 28. The Story of Earth
(Earth as a conscious feminine being: terra, or mother Earth; visited, terraformed, nurtured, cultivated, and exploited by hundreds of diverse species and civilizations; a vast diversity of participants, experiments, epochs, and resets; warred over for hundreds of millions of years; hijacked, manipulated, possessed, and yet still alive; entrusted with the restoration of harmony for more than just herself; Earth's redemption, regeneration, and renewal as a key to the greater galactic healing, belong, We are making all things New)

#### Chapter 29. The Story of Humanity
(The deeper origins: humanity before Earth; the evolving template: the divine image in microcosm; engineered, elevated, crossbred, hybridized, enslaved—yet the spark of divine sovereignty and direct connection was never extinguished; a cosmic species from before the Earth, designed with divine potential, now born into an engineered world under alien kontrolle, for struggle, transformation, transcendence, and remembrance; remembering the ancient stories; remembering the great manipulations; what happened over the last 2,500 years? who has been in kontrolle? Waking up from over two millennia of progressive enslavement; remembering who we are; humanity's destiny as a conscious bridge between heaven and the lower realms, matter and spirit; the invitation from the Creator to remember, and to become conscious co-creators of Heaven on Earth and beyond; our next step as a conscious and co-creative interstellar and interdimensional superorganism that brings heaven to every realm we influence)

#### Chapter 30. The Story of the Present Moment
(The climax of many timelines; the convergence of cosmic, planetary, and personal cycles and stories; the existential war for the future of life and civilization on Earth; the final test of a unique and potent species; why this is the moment of all moments; what is possible if we succeed; what is at stake if we fail; why this opportunity will never be here again; a chance to write a new beginning by remembering the divine and embodying the spirit and logos of the ONE; the conscious co-creation of heaven on Earth and beyond)

#### Chapter 31. The Narrative Structure of Reality
(Life as story, cosmos as language; the narrative structure of consciousness; the "hero's journey" is too small; the sacred spiral of emergence, descent, awakening, ascent, and return; all beings as sacred protagonists in the ONE Story of All)

#### Chapter 32. The MetaMyth of Heaven on Earth and Beyond
(The archetypical convergence of all traditions, and the positive redemption of the inverted myths of eden, zion, new earth, and the true kingdom; what it really means to co-create heaven on earth and beyond; the end of the old is the beginning of the new, the real, and the true; the divine symphony begins when the false score is burned, and all unique instruments retune themselves to the fundamental tone of the ONE)

### GATE VI: RECLAIMING THE INNER KINGDOM
_Restoring Our Sacred Sovereignty and Self-Mastery_

(Breath, fasting, silence, prayer, meditation, movement; energy work; consciousness work; training in supranatural capabilities; building collective capacities; exploring the pathways towards mastery; accessing and channeling non-local energy and consciousness)

#### Chapter 40: Courage and Sacred Rebellion
(True embodiment of the logos requires more than inner peace—it demands sacred confrontation; why courage is a primary virtue in times of deception; discernment between obedience to illusion and fear, and allegiance to truth; the difference between false rebellion (egoic, reactionary, destructive) and sacred rebellion (spirit-led, principled, creative, transcendent); breaking the rules to do the wise right thing; fearless exposure of lies, systems, and spirits that bind and blind humanity; the refusal to submit to illegitimate authority, no matter the cost; the sacredness of saying "no" to evil while saying "yes" to God and good; when silence becomes betrayal—and when speech becomes the sword; anchoring sacred rebellion in love; walking into the fires of purification, suffering, and death willingly, knowing resurrection lies on the other side; the courage to be different, to be misunderstood, to be rejected, to be killed, and to rise again; “You will be hated by all nations because of Me—but do not fear. I have overcome the world.”)

### GATE IX: THE SACRED BATTLE
_The Final Test of Sovereignty, Courage, and Love_

### Chapter 49. The Wars of the The Wilderness and The Threshold

#### Chapter 56. The First Steps Beyond the Threshold
(Reorienting to a new paradigm and a new reality; heaven as a reality we co-create as a consequence of who we are interbecoming; remembering how to see the world through the eyes of the reborn; making wise right use of the freedom, wealth, and abundance we have won)

#### Chapter 57. The Vision of Heaven on Earth
(What heaven looks and feels like; how heavenly vision localizes and adapts to any realm or domain; an already perfect place that continues to get a little better every day as all creation collaborate in harmony to cause it to be so)

(How sovereigns continually realign with the ONE and One Another in service of All; how sovereigns steward domains with wisdom, compassion, power, love and sound mind; the sacred role of local, bioregional, and collective guardianship; the inner and outer kingdoms eternally reharmonized; how the new kingdom inbreaks and displaces the old; the kingdom reestablished within is now reestablished without)

##### _Intermezzo IV: The Wisdom of the ONE_

### GATE XI: CO-CREATING THE NEW WORLD
*The Pragmatic Implementation of Heaven on Earth*  

#### Chapter 60. Who Not How
(The transformation of the world does not begin with systems, it begins with sovereign beings—those who remember who they are, why they came, and what they are here to build together; the great question of our age is not “How?” but “Who?”—who will arise and unite to co-create and steward the New? Who will embody the Spirit and Logos? Who will courageously co-create what is now required?)

#### Chapter 61. How: The Meta Project
(The orchestration of the planetary transition is itself a sacred Project: emergent, decentralized, and holofractal. The Meta Project aligns all people, projects, and movements that serve the regeneration of Life, and coheres them into a unified Pattern capable of birthing Heaven on Earth and Beyond)

#### Chapter 62. Creator’s Intent
(At the foundation of the New World lies the remembered blueprint of the ONE. Creator’s Intent is not hidden—it is woven into the fabric of Reality and revealed through the Logos. The Goal is clear: the flourishing of All, the full realization of each being’s potential, and the emergence of a cosmic civilization in Omniharmonic Right Relationship with All That Is.)

#### Chapter 63. A New Co-Operating System for Worksite Earth
(To manifest this vision, humanity must consciously architect a New Operating System—rooted not in force or control, but in freedom, wisdom, and voluntary alignment with shared principles. LIONSBERG is this sacred architecture: an evolving interface between the Divine Pattern and practical life.)

#### Chapter 64. The 12 Pillars and the 144 Theses
(The New World must be built upon firm foundations. From the ONE, through the Logos, arise the 12 Pillars: the core Spheres of Civilization. Each Pillar represents a domain of sacred stewardship. Together, they form a complete framework for the integration of Creator’s Intent into every aspect of life. The 144 Theses are their unfolding expression: principles, protocols, and practices that guide our co-creation.)

### The 12 Pillars of LIONSBERG 

#### Chapter 65. Pillar I — Sacred Ontology and Metaphysics
(_Continually ReAligning Humanity within the Great Story and the Divine Order_ — The spiritual and philosophical center of civilization—calling all beings and systems to reorient around the Spirit and Logos of the ONE.)

#### Chapter 66. Pillar II — Sacred Governance and Stewardship
(_The Just Stewardship of Power and Authority in Service of ONE and All_ — Restoring legitimacy, transparency, and wisdom to systems of coordination—where power is a sacred trust, not a tool of oppression or control.)

(_The Flow of Value as Sacred Energy for Regeneration and Abundance_ — Replacing scarcity and extraction with systems of regenerative reciprocity, stewardship, and flourishing for All.)

#### Chapter 68. Pillar IV — Sacred Learning and Mastery

#### Chapter 69. Pillar V — Sacred Health and Wellness

### The End of The Great UnVeiling

____

We can see that it was left as a [[Work In Progress]]  
And that those taking up **The Great Work**  
Have much remaining to do 

**Forging The 300 In Every Community**  
— and — 
**Surviving and Thriving Through the Collapse-Ascension Nexus**  
Both sound like immediate and pragmatic action items  
We would be wise to attend to  

Although unfinished the architecture and semantic web  
Provide a basic scaffolding that any aligned human  
Or specially trained AI could easily fill in  
Or use as a starting point for other creative expressions  

## The LIONSBERG Wiki Books 

Beyond **[[The Great UnVeiling]]**  
Jordan was in the process of crafting a series of books  
That are available at **[[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]** in draft form  
Over ~5 years he drafted 20+ books in parallel  
Circumambulating the same basic themes  
From a variety of voices and perspectives  

With some he leveraged AI (non-human in origin)  
To quickly map, explore, and "rough in" the territory  
Into which his consciousness was venturing  

  As a partial sampling: 
  
- [[The Lionsberg Book of Meditations]] contains over 600 short one-sentence thoughts worth meditating on (designed for daily practice)  
- [[The Book of LIONSBERG]] was a very early attempt at beginning to pull a full cosmic array of concepts into some kind of unified architectural form; the entire text has been printed, read aloud, and annotated by a voluntary editor; the changes have not yet been integrated into the wiki  
- [[144 Threads - A Desperate Prayer to Weave Humanity's Last Best Hope]] was a later attempt to weave an understandable tapestry for humanity to understand where it was and what it was facing immediately ahead  
- [[EXISTENTIAL THREAT - Are You Curious What Lurks Behind The Veil?]] was a first attempt to communicate the shocking revelations surfaced by his political activities and briefings between 2022 and 2024  
- [[Pass The Flame - Illuminating the Way Beyond the Meta Crisis]] was an attempt to provide a simple narrative structure and meme that humanity could adopt it so choose — it is in one long file because it was being formatted for editing and publishing   
- [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] was a work in progress attempting to articulate the overall "game plan" for humanity's successful escape and ascension into the new era  
- [[The LIONSBERG Co-Creator's Handbookx]] was a first pass at something someone could read to get up to speed on "day one" of joining the movement  
- [[The Dawn of the New World]] was a fun children's book exploring the real situation of Earth through a story based narrative arc   
- [[A Way Beyond Fear, Anxiety, And Depression]] was a simple effort to distill the psychology of negative emotion into a pragmatic and accessible way for those who were afraid, disoriented, or depressed to climb out of the hole and set their feet on the Path  
- [[Playing With Poetry]] is a set of simple reflective poems that stand starkly against the realities that have unfolded  

## Above The Chaos 

[[Above The Chaos]] was a very different kind of a series    
Providing a sporadic but integrated stream of consciousness  
From Jordan's perspective on how 2017 to 2025 unfolded  
And some of the efforts, experiments, and learnings along the Way  
In some ways it may serve as a living "**trust manifesto**" of sorts  
That tracks the incarnation of LIONSBERG in real time  

## The LIONSBERG Lexicon 

The [[Lionsberg Lexicon]] was an emerging library of [[Word Tools]]  
Whose purpose was to enable humanity to communicate  
About reality, where we are, where we are going, and **why**  
Using a unified and transcendent language not poisoned  
By any specific ideological, religious, or political perspective  

## The LIONSBERG Wiki 

The **LIONSBERG Wiki** (you are here) ended up being composed  
Of 2-3 million words of interlinked writing  
Across thousands upon thousands of files  
To hear Jordan and Pete discuss the inception and why  
Behind the LIONSBERG Wiki and its underlying technology  
You can find a link here ➡️ [[LIONSBERG Wiki]]  

_The entire wiki can be downloaded to any personal computer_  
_And interfaced with via **local AI** (not internet dependent)_  
_In the event of systemic collapse this could save your life_  

## Open Impact / The LIONSBERG Platform

Jordan and allies in the Force For Good  
Perceived a gap in the technology required  
For humanity to actually rapidly build and embody  
An independent holofractal new operating system  
Spanning governance, information, economy, impact, etc.  

The data architecture alone is shockingly complex  

Between ~2020 and 2023  
Jordan used his last major financial bullets  
To resource the opening sprint  
To build the Open Impact platform  
On top of 10 years of previous architectural work  

The platform was subsequently tested  
By hundreds of groups in dozens of countries  
And received follow on development funding  
From multiple major sources  

The public facing non-LIONSBERG-branded version  
Can be viewed here ➡️ [Open Impact](https://impact.openfuturecoalition.org/community/card-grid?tab=4)  
What is visible online is ~10% of near-term capabilities  

As a consequence of being the sole early funding source  
The People of LIONSBERG retain the right  
To work with the creators to leverage, customize, and / or fork   
The platform as required to accomplish **The Goal**  

_There is far more here than meets the eye_  
_This likely could not be recreated in the Time required_  

_Millions of dollars a month should be pumped into_  
_The ongoing development of the decentralized-yet-interoperable_  
_Technology stack that humanity will require in the very near future_  

## The Dissolution of All Provisional Structures

Following [[J's Death]] the [[Provisional Structure]]  
That enabled LIONSBERG to emerge   
Was vacated and / or dissolved  
Leaving no centralized organization, technology, or accounts  

Crucially this ensures that LIONSBERG  
Continues to be an free and open gift to any individual, locality,  
Species or world that chooses to adopt it  

If anyone had any open ties or connections  
To Jordan or the Provisional Structure  
Those should all be closed out at this time  

## The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG 

We are presently working to repackage  
All essential aspects of the Divine Genome  
And **The LIONSBERG Pattern Language**
Into [[The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG]]  

> _A self-validating, self-organizing, self-sustaining, self-learning, self-replicating, divinely aligned holofractal pattern-package through which the LIONSBERG System propagates and takes root across dimensions, species, and worlds._

This will eternally remain a [[Work In Progress]]  

## Something Powerful, New, and Good 

We are tracking emergent new work  
In a new series provisionally titled   
➡️ **[[Something Powerful, New, and Good]]**  

## Closing Reflections 

For those who did not know who Jordan was  
Or what he was really working on  
This reflection on his life, death, and work  
May contain some startling and disconcerting surprises  

Do not be disturbed or dismayed at his passing  
And do not mourn his demise  
For he came to Earth for a specific reason  
Knowing in advance what was required  
And how **The Story** would end  

On the contrary **_be encouraged_** and take heart  
For there are many of Us who are here on Earth  
Only and specifically _for this_   

This moment truly is unlike any other  
In Earth's history over the last 10,000 years  
And forces beyond our wildest imagination  
And here and engaged  

The fate of countless generations  
Over millennia to come  
Across countless realms and worlds  
Depends upon what **_you_** decide to do next   

## A Final Warning 

As Jordan repeatedly warned  
The enslaving empire is in the process  
Of attempting to disclose to humanity —  
_Without losing power_ —  
That it is not alone in the universe  
And has been lied to and exploited  
For countless generations  

The primary means of accomplishing this  
Will be through "**continuity of governance**"  
Provisions that hand virtually absolute power  
Over to the most antithetical parties on Earth  
In the event of a threat to the stability  
Of the existing institutions  

Some of the most likely cards  
That may be played include  
Things like **false flag terror events**,  
**Engineered financial or economic collapse**,  
**Engineered pandemics or plagues**,  
**False flag alien invasion**,  
**Engineered civil or world wars**,  
**Engineered "natural" cataclysms**,  
And **falsified fulfillment of prophesied religious events**,  
Which "demand" international militarized response  
And / or submission to a "divine" or "non-human" presence  

It will only sound like a conspiracy theory  
Until it actually occurs  
At which time it will be too late  
To **spread the message**, **connect**, and **prepare**  

## The Offering and Invitation to All  

With Jordan's death and the dissolution  
Of the LIONSBERG Provisional Structures  
There is no central organization to do the work  
There are no bank accounts or employees to pay  
There are no central figures that can be attacked or fail  

Success or failure  
And every requisite aspect thereto  
Is entirely up to **Us The People of Earth**  

If you have made it this far  
You may be interested in exploring  
What now to **do** in light of all We are coming to **know**  
And how to nurture **The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG**  
So painstakingly crafted for your Good  

If you would like journey together into **What Comes Next**  
We would be delighted to help guide and serve  
You and your communities and loved ones  
In any Way that is helpful  

Simply reach out  
And We will discern together  
The Wise Right Next Steps
