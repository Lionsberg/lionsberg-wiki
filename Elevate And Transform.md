# Elevate And Transform

In the context of the [[LIONSBERG System]], "Elevate And Transform" is a guiding principle that encourages individuals and groups to actively work together towards the [[Betterment]] of their [[Selves]], their [[Communities]], and [[Society]] and the [[Living System]] as a Whole. This principle encompasses the triune objectives of personal transformation, societal transformation, and ecological regeneration, acknowledging that each are essential to achieving the [[New World]] envisioned by the [[LIONSBERG Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]].

To "Elevate And Transform," [[Co-Creators]] in the Lionsberg System are encouraged to:

1.  Pursue personal growth, learning, and development in order to become more effective [[Conscious Agents]] of change and better serve the collective mission.
2.  Engage in [[Continuous Learning And Improvement]], refining and evolving their practices, strategies, and approaches in response to new insights, experiences, and feedback.
3.  Collaborate with others to address the root causes of societal challenges, recognizing that transformation requires collective action and systemic change.
4.  Embrace and embody the values and principles outlined in the [[LIONSBERG Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]], inspiring others to join [[The Movement]] and contribute their unique talents, perspectives, and resources.
5.  Foster a [[Culture]] of optimism, resilience, and creativity, believing in the transformative potential of our collective efforts and the possibility of a better future for [[All]] living beings.

By committing to "Elevate And Transform," [[Co-Creators]] can support one another in their individual and collective journeys towards the [[Land Of Promise]], helping to [[Cross The Chasm]] and create a thriving, regenerative, and just society for [[All]].
