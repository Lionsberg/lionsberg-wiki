# 3.6. Encouraging Self-Organization, responsibility and Adaptability

A key aspect of implementing Citizen Led Governance is fostering a culture of self-organization, responsibility and adaptability among stakeholders that is built to transform and evolve over time. This can be achieved by providing resources, tools, and training that empower individuals and associations to take responsibility for their own well-being and development, as well as that of their communities and domains, while evolving towards [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] over time. By encouraging continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation, the governance system can become more resilient and responsive to changing needs, priorities, and contexts.
