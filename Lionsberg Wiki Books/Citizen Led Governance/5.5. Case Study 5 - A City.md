# 5.5. Case Study 5 - A City

A city implements a Citizen Led Governance model by establishing a network of neighborhood assemblies, where residents can come together to discuss and make decisions about local issues. This decentralized structure enables citizens to take a more active role in shaping the policies and initiatives that affect their lives, while also allowing the city government to be more responsive and accountable to the needs of its residents. The distributed wisdom of the neighborhood assemblies is aggregated and reported back out across the network, leading to far greater collective consciousness and problem solving around the issues and opportunities in the community. Through the Lionsberg federation, the City cross pollinates ideas and solutions with other cities around the world, leading to innovative breakthroughs and new relationships and opportunities for community members.
