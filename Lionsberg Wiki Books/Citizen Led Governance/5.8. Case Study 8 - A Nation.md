# 5.8. Case Study 8 - A Nation

After thousands of Citizen Impact Groups and Citizen Assemblies spring up across a nation, the nation adopts a Citizen Led Governance model, creating a decentralized and federated structure that allows citizens to participate directly in the decision-making process at multiple levels of governance. This model encourages self-organization and adaptability, enabling the nation to more effectively address the needs and priorities of its diverse population. As a result, an additional Citizen Led branch of government is established, taxes are lowered, power and resources are distributed back out to localities, and the entire nation begins helping one another advance towards their shared vision, principles, and values.
