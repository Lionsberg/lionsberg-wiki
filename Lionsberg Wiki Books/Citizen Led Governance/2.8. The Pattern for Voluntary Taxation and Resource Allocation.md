# 2.8. The Pattern for Voluntary Taxation and Resource Allocation


**Context**: In the Lionsberg model, the focus is on voluntary contributions and resource allocation, encouraging citizens and voluntary associations to actively participate in the funding and decision-making processes that impact their communities and domains of responsibility and authority.

**Problem:** Traditional taxation systems can be coercive and may not effectively distribute resources based on local needs and priorities.

**Forces:**

-   Coercive taxation systems
-   Inefficient resource allocation
-   Limited citizen participation in funding decisions
-   Disconnection between taxpayers and beneficiaries 
-   Waste and coercion at higher levels of abstraction 
-   Practical need to aggregate and apply resources 

**Solution:** The Lionsberg model proposes a pattern for voluntary taxation and resource allocation from the bottom up based on the following principles:

1.  **Promote a culture of voluntary contributions**: Encourage a culture of voluntary contributions to support common needs and goals within each domain of responsibility and authority, targeting the time and wisdom tested 10% as an Ideal. 
2. **~ 10% at Each Fractal Level**: Each Sovereign uses their own individual and local wisdom and judgment to voluntarily contribute and divide approximately 10% of their flow of available resources across the (multiple) Sovereigns in the federation that are most contributing to their flourishing, growth, and success. 
3.  **Transparent resource allocation**: Establish transparent mechanisms for resource allocation across all fractal scales, ensuring that funds are directed to the most pressing needs and priorities within each domain while empowering the Whole to Progress towards [[The Goal]]. 
4.  **Inclusive decision-making**: Involve citizens and voluntary associations in the decision-making process related to resource allocation, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.
5.  **Accountability and feedback**: Create systems for tracking the impact of resource allocation and providing feedback to contributors, ensuring that resources are used effectively and efficiently.
6.  **Adaptive resource allocation**: Continuously adapt resource allocation strategies in response to changing needs, priorities, and contexts within each domain.
7.  **Encourage resource pooling and sharing**: Support the pooling and sharing of resources among voluntary associations and citizens at higher levels of abstraction, maximizing the impact and effectiveness of their collective efforts.

**Resulting Context:** A voluntary taxation and resource allocation system that fosters active citizen participation, ensures effective and efficient use of resources, and is responsive to local needs and priorities within each domain of responsibility and authority.
