# 4.3. Ensuring Accountability and Transparency

Accountability and transparency are critical for building trust and maintaining the legitimacy of the governance system. To ensure that stakeholders are held accountable for their actions and decisions, it is important to establish clear standards, processes, and mechanisms for reporting, oversight, and enforcement. This will involve creating independent institutions or bodies that are responsible for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the governance system, as well as ensuring that stakeholders have access to the information they need to hold each other accountable for their actions and decisions. To serve the emergence, Lionsberg has addressed these in its blueprint for the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] via the [[Lionsberg Regulatory Groups]].
