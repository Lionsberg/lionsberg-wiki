# 1.  Introduction to Citizen Led Governance

Citizen Led Governance is a paradigm-shifting approach to organizing societies, where power is decentralized, and decision-making processes stem from the bottom up on the basis of individual and local [[Sovereignty]] and [[Autonomy]]. It emphasizes the importance of individuals, communities, and voluntary associations in shaping their own futures, fostering a sense of decentralized ownership, [[Liberty]] and [[Responsibility]]. This introductory section provides an overview of the Lionsberg Vision and Goal, the 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity, and the urgent and emergent need for a [[New Era]] of Self-Governance.
