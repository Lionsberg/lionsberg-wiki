# 1.1. The Lionsberg Vision and Goal

The Lionsberg Vision is a world where individuals and communities work together with a shared sense of [[Purpose]] and [[Values]] to co-create a just, [[Regenerative]], and [[Flourishing]] society and world. The goal is to empower citizens to actively participate in the process of individual, local, and collective transformation and self-governance, fostering a distributed sense of collective responsibility and agency.

To achieve this vision, the Lionsberg model focuses on the following objectives:

-   Encouraging civic engagement and active participation in decision-making processes that shape our lives and our world  
-   Building robust networks of voluntary associations, small groups, and citizen assemblies that facilitate collaboration and shared learning  
-   Developing a federated and decentralized system that allows for flexibility, adaptability, self-organization, and ecosystemic resource flows in pursuit of shared goals and values  
-   Creating a pattern language for Fractal Self-Governance, which serves as a foundation for evolving communities, bioregions, and the whole   
-  Articulating and systematizing the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]] that enable the higher order functional unity and shared infrastructure, resources, and support required for the decentralized array to avoid failure, flourish and succeed
