# 3.1. Establishing a Shared Vision and Story

To implement Citizen Led Governance, the first step is to establish a shared Vision and Narrative Structure, or Story, for the community, region, or Whole. This vision should be aligned with the universal principles and values that underpin the Lionsberg System and Approach, ensuring that the governance system is designed to promote individual flourishing, collective well-being, and environmental regenerativity. This process should involve engaging a diverse range of stakeholders in participatory dialogue and consensus-building to develop a common understanding of the desired Future State, and the systems and strategies needed to achieve it.
