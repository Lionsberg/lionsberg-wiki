# 5.7. Case Study 7 - A Network of Citizen Assemblies

Citizen assemblies from different regions or countries come together to form a global network, sharing best practices and learning from each other's experiences. This network enables the development and dissemination of innovative solutions to complex global challenges, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among diverse communities. My aggregating wisdom, knowledge, and solutions on the Lionsberg Platform, each Citizen Assembly group gains access to a wide array of solutions, templates, and ideas that they can localize and adapt to their own problems, needs, and priorities, along with mentoring and coaching from Citizens who have successfully implemented the solutions in the past.
