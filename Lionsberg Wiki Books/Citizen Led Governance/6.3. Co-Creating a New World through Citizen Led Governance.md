# 6.3. Co-Creating a New World through Citizen Led Governance

The future of Citizen Led Governance holds the potential for humanity to work together to co-create a new world in partnership and right relationship with God and One Another, where power and resources are distributed more justly, governance is more inclusive and local, and communities are more resilient and adaptive as a result of their local responsibility and collective federation. By empowering individuals, families, and communities to take control of their own destinies and work together to address shared challenges, we can co-create a world that reflects our collective values, aspirations, and dreams. As more people adopt Citizen Led Governance models and practices, we will see a gradual transformation in the way our societies function and evolve, ultimately leading to a more just and regenerative future for all.
