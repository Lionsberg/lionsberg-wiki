# 5.4. Case Study 4 - A Small Community

A small community adopts a participatory budgeting process, allowing residents to have a direct say in how public funds are allocated. This process fosters a sense of ownership and engagement among community members, leading to more effective and responsive allocation of resources that better meet the needs and priorities of the community. The process of identifying and prioritizing issues and values leads to voluntary contributions from those with the means to accelerate progress, leading to far greater resources being applied to meet needs and solve problems.
