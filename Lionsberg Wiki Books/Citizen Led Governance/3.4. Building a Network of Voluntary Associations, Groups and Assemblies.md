# 3.4. Building a Network of Voluntary Associations, Groups and Assemblies

The implementation of Citizen Led Governance relies on the formation or merging of voluntary associations, groups, and assemblies that collaborate to address common needs and goals within their domains of responsibility and authority. These associations should be encouraged to self-organize and form networks, building a decentralized and federated structure that enables effective decision-making and resource allocation at the most appropriate scale. This can be achieved through the establishment of platforms, tools, and resources that facilitate collaboration, communication, and coordination among these associations. To serve the emergence, Lionsberg has established one such platform for this purpose.
