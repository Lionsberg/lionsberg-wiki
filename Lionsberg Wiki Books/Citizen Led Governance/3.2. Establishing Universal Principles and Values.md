# 3.2. Establishing Universal Principles and Values

The next step in implementing Citizen Led Governance is to define the universal principles and values that will guide decision-making and behavior across all domains and scales of the governance system. These principles and values should be grounded in the universal principles and values that Lionsberg is founded upon, and should be designed to foster subsidiarity, consent-based participation, stewardship of the commons, individual sovereignty, and universal citizenship. By clearly articulating and promoting universal principles and values, such as Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Liberty and Right Relationship, communities can build a strong foundation for Citizen Led Governance that is aligned with their shared vision and goal.
