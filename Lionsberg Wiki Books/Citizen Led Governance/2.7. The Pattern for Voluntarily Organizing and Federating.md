# 2.7. The Pattern for Voluntarily Organizing and Federating


**Context**: In the Lionsberg model, governance is based on voluntary collaboration and self-organization, ensuring citizens and voluntary associations retain their sovereignty and autonomy, while affording the higher order functional unity required to address complex challenges and navigate collectively. 

**Problem:** Hierarchical governance structures often lead to the concentration of power, stifling innovation, and reducing adaptability to changing circumstances.

**Forces:**

-   Centralization of power
-   Inability to address complex challenges
-   Reduced innovation and adaptability
-   Loss of autonomy and sovereignty 
-   Lack of Higher Order Functional Unity 

**Solution:** The Lionsberg model promotes a pattern for voluntary organizing and federating towards [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] based on the following principles:

1.  **Encourage voluntary associations**: Promote the formation of voluntary associations around shared needs, problems, and goals within their domains of responsibility and authority.
2.  **Support self-organization and autonomy**: Foster the self-organization and autonomy of these associations within their respective domains, enabling them to address challenges and opportunities effectively.
3.  **Develop collaboration mechanisms**: Create clear mechanisms for collaboration, coordination, and resource-sharing among associations at different levels of the governance system, while respecting their autonomy and sovereignty.
4.  **Foster a culture of trust and cooperation**: Encourage a culture of trust, cooperation, and mutual support among associations, recognizing that working together can lead to more effective solutions and shared success.
5.  **Encourage federation based on common objectives**: Support voluntary associations to federate based on common objectives and values, while maintaining their autonomy and sovereignty, enabling them to address larger-scale challenges and opportunities.
6.  **Provide shared infrastructure and support**: Offer a shared infrastructure and support system that enables federated associations to flourish and achieve their collective goals within their domains of responsibility and authority.
7. **Provide an array of templates and special purpose vehicles**: Provide an array of templates and pre-built special purpose vehicles that allow groups to quickly form according to the best practices of the emerging federation. 

**Resulting Context:** A federated, decentralized system of governance emerges organically from the bottom up, where voluntary associations collaborate effectively while retaining their autonomy and sovereignty. This system fosters innovation, adaptability, and the ability to address complex challenges and opportunities at various scales.
