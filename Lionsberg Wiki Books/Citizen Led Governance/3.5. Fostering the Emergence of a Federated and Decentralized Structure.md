# 3.5. Fostering the Emergence of a Federated and Decentralized Structure

As voluntary associations, groups, and assemblies form and self-organize, the governance system will naturally evolve towards a federated and decentralized structure. To support this process, it is important to develop clear mechanisms for collaboration, coordination, and resource-sharing among associations at different levels of the governance system, while respecting their autonomy and sovereignty. This may involve creating shared infrastructure, support systems, and decision-making processes that enable effective cooperation and mutual support among associations as they work towards their common objectives.
