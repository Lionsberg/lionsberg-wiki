# 5.2. Case Study 2 - A Family

A family comes together to create a shared vision for their future, identifying goals and values that guide their collective decision-making and navigation. They establish regular family meetings to discuss progress, share ideas, and address concerns, fostering a sense of shared responsibility for their collective well-being and success. The active pursuit of their shared goals and values bridges differences, heals woulds and separation, and creates a sense of shared agency and responsibility among the children. The children begin proactively exploring new ideas, taking on new responsibilities, and developing metrics and accountability around their commitments to the family.
