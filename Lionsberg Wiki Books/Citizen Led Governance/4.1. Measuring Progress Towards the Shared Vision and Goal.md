# 4.1. Measuring Progress Towards the Shared Vision and Goal

Monitoring and evaluation are essential components of Citizen Led Governance, as they help to ensure that the governance system is moving towards its shared vision and goal. To measure progress, it is important to establish clear indicators, metrics, and milestones that reflect the desired outcomes and objectives of the governance system. These indicators should be regularly tracked and reported, providing stakeholders with the information they need to assess the success of their collective efforts and make informed decisions about the future direction of the governance system and the federation as a whole.
