# 4.2. Stacking Up and Aligning Progress

In a decentralized and federated governance system, it is crucial to ensure that the progress being made at different levels and domains is aligned and mutually reinforcing. This can be achieved by creating mechanisms for sharing information, coordinating efforts, and aligning goals and objectives across different associations, groups, and assemblies. By stacking up and aligning progress in this way, the governance system can effectively leverage the collective resources and capabilities of its stakeholders to achieve its shared vision and goal more efficiently and effectively. To serve the emergence, Lionsberg has created the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]], purpose-built and integrated with the [[Lionsberg Platform]].
