# 2.12. The Pattern for Individual and Local Sovereignty and Universal Citizenship

**Context**: In the Lionsberg model, individual sovereignty is recognized and respected, while the concept of universal citizenship emphasizes the interconnectedness of all citizens within a fractal governance system, regardless of the specific domains they participate in.

**Problem:** A lack of recognition for individual sovereignty and universal citizenship can lead to disenfranchisement, disconnection, and a weakened sense of responsibility towards the well-being of the whole.

**Forces:**

-   Disenfranchisement and disconnection
-   Erosion of individual rights and sovereignty
-   Lack of a sense of belonging and responsibility
-   Tendency to focus on local or national interests at the expense of global well-being
-   Conflicting interests between different domains
-   Lack of access to universally required infrastructure, solutions, and support 

**Solution:** The Lionsberg model promotes a pattern for individual sovereignty and universal citizenship based on the following principles:

1.  **Recognize and respect individual sovereignty**: Acknowledge and respect the sovereignty of each individual within their domains of responsibility and authority, ensuring that their rights, freedoms, and autonomy are protected.  
2.  **Respect and retain existing citizenships and affiliations**: Acknowledge that each individual comes from a diverse background, and carries with them existing citizenships and affiliations of various kinds, ensuring that individuals are able to retain and uphold existing affiliations, while voluntarily adopting new affiliations. 
3.  **Foster a sense of universal citizenship**: Encourage a sense of belonging and responsibility towards the well-being of the entire human family, transcending local, regional, and national boundaries, and embracing the interconnectedness of all life.
4.  **Promote shared values and principles**: Cultivate a shared understanding of the values and principles that underpin the Lionsberg model, such as subsidiarity, consent-based participation, and stewardship of the commons, fostering alignment across domains and scales.
5.  **Encourage inter-domain collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration and cooperation among individuals and voluntary associations from different domains and scales, building bridges and fostering a sense of shared purpose and mutual support.
6.  **Balance individual and collective interests**: Develop mechanisms for balancing individual sovereignty with collective well-being and long-term sustainability, ensuring that the rights and freedoms of individuals are harmonized with the needs of the whole.
7.  **Cultivate global awareness and empathy**: Encourage individuals to develop a global perspective and empathy for people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, fostering a deeper understanding of shared challenges and opportunities.
8.  **Empower individuals to contribute**: Provide opportunities and resources for individuals to actively participate in and contribute to the well-being of their local, regional, and global communities, recognizing their unique talents and potential.
9. **Access to universal wisdom, knowledge, solutions, infrastructure, and support**: Provide all Citizens with access to a continuously improving set of wisdom, knowledge, resources, infrastructure, solutions, services, and support regardless of which domains and localities they participate in. 

**Resulting Context:** A society where individual sovereignty is respected and protected and all citizens have access to the ladders they need to climb towards their potential and flourish, while a sense of universal citizenship and stewardship fosters cooperation, empathy, and shared responsibility towards the well-being of the whole. This pattern strengthens the bonds between individuals and voluntary associations across different domains and scales, leading to more resilient and adaptive fractal governance systems that balance individual and collective interests.
