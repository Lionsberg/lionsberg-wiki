# 6.1. Overcoming Challenges

Citizen Led Governance faces numerous challenges, including resistance from existing power structures, the self-interest and fear of existing groups and organizations, fear of scarcity, limited resources at the higher levels of abstraction, and the need for widespread cultural change. To overcome these challenges, it will be important for proponents of Citizen Led Governance to build strong networks, share knowledge and resources, gather and allocate resources wisely, and develop innovative solutions to complex problems. By fostering a culture of collaboration and mutual support, Citizen Led Governance can gradually gain traction and momentum, ultimately leading to transformative change in the way societies are governed.
