# 2.6. The Pattern for Citizen Led Self-Governance

**Context**: In the Lionsberg model, governance is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes sovereignty and autonomy at all levels, and decision-making at the lowest appropriate level through a distributed network of voluntary associations within a uniting confederation, ensuring that local needs and contexts are prioritized and satisfied.

**Problem:** Traditional top-down governance structures are often unresponsive to local needs and contexts, resulting in disengaged citizens, inefficient decision-making processes, and wasteful aggregation and allocation of resources and power that does not create individual and local flourishing.

**Forces:**

-   Concentration of power
-   Limited citizen engagement
-   Inefficient decision-making
-   Lack of responsiveness to local needs 
-   Abdication of responsibility and authority to higher levels of abstraction 

**Solution:** The Lionsberg model promotes a pattern for Citizen Led Self-Governance based on the following steps:

1.  **Cultivate personal responsibility**: Encourage citizens to take responsibility for their own lives, well-being, and their role in the community.
2.  **Form Citizen Groups**: Facilitate the formation of Citizen Groups, which allow citizens to collaborate on specific needs, problems, and goals within their [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]].   
3. **Define Domains of Responsibility and Authority**: Clearly define every [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]], from the Individual, Family, and Local, all the way up through every fractal level to the universal collective. 
4. **Create Fields of Agreement**: Forge a defined [[Field of Agreements]] for each [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]]. 
5. **Establish Boundaries**: Establish strong boundaries around each Domain, so that participation can occur on the basis of reciprocal and voluntary [[Consent]]  
6. **Participation by Consent**: Voluntarily organize and federate on the basis of mutual consent to Participation, and agreement to honor and uphold the [[Field of Agreements]] in each defined Domain of Participation. 
7.  **Access to resources and tools**: Provide access to resources, knowledge, and tools that empower citizens to participate effectively in the decision-making process within their domains of responsibility and authority.
8.  **Inclusive and collaborative culture**: Foster a culture of openness, inclusivity, and collaboration, where diverse perspectives are valued and respected, and each citizen is encouraged to participate in decision-making within their domains of responsibility and authority.
9.  **Clear communication channels**: Establish clear channels for communication and decision-making at all levels of the fractal governance system, ensuring that decisions made within a domain are transparent and can be integrated with decisions made in other domains.
10.  **Evaluation and improvement**: Develop mechanisms for evaluating and improving the effectiveness and inclusivity of the self-governance process within each domain, enabling continuous learning and adaptation.

**Resulting Context:** A responsive and inclusive system of Citizen led self-governance, where citizens are empowered to actively participate in decision-making processes within their domains of responsibility and authority, resulting in more effective, context-specific solutions, from the individual, family, and local levels, all the way up to the broadest collective.
