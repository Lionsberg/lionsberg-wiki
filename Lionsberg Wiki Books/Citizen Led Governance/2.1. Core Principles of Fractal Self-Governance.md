# 2.1. Core Principles of Fractal Self-Governance

Fractal Self-Governance is founded on several core principles that provide a foundation for the Lionsberg model of Citizen Led Governance:

1.  **Subsidiarity**: Decision-making should occur at the lowest appropriate level of abstraction, ensuring that local needs and contexts are understood and prioritized. 
2.  **Fractal Scalability**: The governance structure should be able to grow and adapt to accommodate different scales and complexities of challenges, from the individual and local, all the way up to the broadest collective.
3.  **Flexibility**: The system should be adaptable and resilient, allowing for continuous learning, improvement, and evolution over time.
4.  **Inclusivity**: All citizens should have the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives and contribute to the common good.
5.  **Collaboration**: Cooperation among individuals, communities, and organizations is essential for addressing complex challenges and achieving shared goals. 
6. **Free Will**: Individuals and localities should remain sovereign, autonomous, and free, and proactively protect one another from the power and potential of associating and federating.
