# 1.2. The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity

[[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]] is a crucial period during which humanity faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. These challenges, including environmental degradation, socioeconomic injustice, political polarization, technological disruption, geopolitical conflict, and [[The Advance of The Giants]] require innovative solutions and transformative change. Spanning approximately 2024 through 2030, the 7 Year Window represents a unique chance for societies to rethink the way they govern themselves and move together towards shared vision, goals, and values, and collectively work towards a more regenerative and just future.

Citizen Led Governance, with its emphasis on bottom-up decision-making, voluntary associations, free-market stewardship, and Fractal Self-Governance, provides an innovative approach to addressing these challenges and harnessing the opportunities of the 7 Year Window.
