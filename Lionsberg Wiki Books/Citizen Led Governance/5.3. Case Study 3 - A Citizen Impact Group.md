# 5.3. Case Study 3 - A Citizen Impact Group

A group of concerned citizens forms a Citizen Impact Group to address a pressing issue in their community, such as homelessness, violence, or access to high quality education. The group collaborates with other stakeholders, including local government and community organizations, to develop and implement innovative solutions that make a measurable difference in the lives of those affected by the issue. By applying the Lionsberg System and Approach to the issues at hand, they deeper their understanding and capacity for collective action and positive change, in turn empowering them to improve their individual, family, and community self-governance and quality of life.
