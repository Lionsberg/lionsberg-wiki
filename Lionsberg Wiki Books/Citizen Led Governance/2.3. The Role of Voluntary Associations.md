# 2.3. The Role of Voluntary Associations

Voluntary associations play a crucial role in the Lionsberg model, as they facilitate citizen engagement and cooperation. Voluntary association can take various forms, such as marriages, families, citizen impact groups, neighborhood groups, businesses, non-profits, professional associations, citizen assemblies, formal organizations, or issue-based networks. They provide a platform for citizens to:

-   Share information and resources  
-   Collaborate on projects and initiatives  
-   Meet needs, solve problems, and accomplish goals  
-   Develop new skills and capacities  
-   Build social capital and trust  
-   Gather and allocate resources 

By fostering a sense of shared purpose and responsibility, voluntary associations contribute to the overall resilience and adaptability of the Citizen Led Governance system.

As with all aspects of the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]], the concept of [[Voluntary Association]] is fractal, intended to stack up and align from the individual, to small groups, to communities, bioregions, tribes, nations, and the Whole.
