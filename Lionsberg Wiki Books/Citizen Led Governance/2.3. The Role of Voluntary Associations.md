# 2.3. The Role of Voluntary Associations

Voluntary associations play a crucial role in the Lionsberg model, as they facilitate citizen engagement and cooperation. These organizations can take various forms, such as Citizen Impact Groups, neighborhood groups, professional associations, citizen assemblies, formal organizations, or issue-based networks. They provide a platform for citizens to:

-   Share information and resources  
-   Collaborate on projects and initiatives  
-   Meet needs, solve problems, and accomplish goals  
-   Develop new skills and capacities  
-   Build social capital and trust  
-   Gather and allocate resources 

By fostering a sense of shared purpose and responsibility, voluntary associations contribute to the overall resilience and adaptability of the Citizen Led Governance system.
