# 3.3. Establishing Universal Citizenship and Belonging

To foster a sense of universal citizenship and belonging, it is important to create inclusive and accessible processes for individuals to join and participate in the governance system. This may involve establishing a universal declaration of citizenship, which outlines the rights, responsibilities, and privileges associated with being a member of the community, region, or global system. By emphasizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of all citizens, regardless of their specific domains of participation, this declaration can help to build a strong sense of shared identity and purpose among stakeholders. To serve the emergence, Lionsberg is hosting a Universal Citizenship directory and platform, that gives each Individual Citizen a deeper belonging and access to the commons beyond they discrete groups or domains they participate in.
