# 5.6. Case Study 6 - A Network of Goodwill

A network of voluntary associations and groups forms around a shared commitment to social and environmental justice, pooling their resources and expertise to amplify their impact. This network collaborates on projects and initiatives that address pressing challenges and create positive change at a regional or even global scale. The association of multiple networks allows those with resources and capacities to make new connections and relationships with others who share their passions, leading to a decentralized acceleration of multiple projects and initiatives simultaneously across the network.
