# The Lionsberg Guide To Movement Building 

[[We Do Not Know]] how to build a [[Meta Movement]] so big it could sweep the world within 7 years, inviting [[All]] humanity up into a [[New World]]. 

So it may seem strange to write a Guide on Movement Building. 

But no one knows how to build a [[Meta Movement]] so big it can sweep the world. 

So we are taking the approach of called for by the [[The LIONSBERG Meta Science]] - documenting our [[Current Best Understanding]] in the form of a [[Hypothesis]], testing it for fit against [[Reality]], and then continuously improving how closely our [[Hypothesis]] conforms to [[Reality]]. 

This is a strange topic, because it can probably only happen once in human history, or certainly only once in the next thousand years. 

But nevertheless, we have to try, openly, transparently, and accountably. 

This [[Guide]] will seek to not only transparently lay out how We plan to try... but also how you can help.
