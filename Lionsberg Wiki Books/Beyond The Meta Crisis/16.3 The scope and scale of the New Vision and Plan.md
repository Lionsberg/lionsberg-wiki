# 16.3 The scope and scale of the New Vision and Plan

The New Vision and Plan is a comprehensive and holistic approach that addresses all aspects of life, including economic, social, environmental, political, and spiritual. It is designed to be voluntarily implemented at the global, national, and local levels, and it recognizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all life on Earth. The New Vision and Plan is intended to be flexible and adaptable, and it is designed to be integrated into the existing systems and structures of society in a way that is transformative and evolutionary, rather than disruptive and revolutionary. It is a long-term vision and plan that is intended to guide humanity towards a better and more sustainable future, and it is designed to be progressively realized and evolved over the course of generations. The New Vision and Plan is a living document that is intended to evolve and adapt over time as humanity learns and grows, and it is intended to be a source of guidance, inspiration, and hope for all people and all generations of life.
