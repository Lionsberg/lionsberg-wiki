# 18 The Role of Culture and Values

Culture and values play a critical role in shaping the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals and societies. They influence how we view ourselves and others, how we interact with the world around us, how we do things, and what we consider to be important and meaningful in our lives.

#### 18.1 Promoting the Values of the New Vision and Plan

Culture and values must promote the values and goals of the New Vision and Plan for humanity. This includes promoting truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom, and encouraging individuals and communities to live in a way that supports the well-being of all beings and the planet. This requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that engages individuals, communities, organizations, and governments in a process of cultural transformation.

#### 18.2 Fostering Diversity and Inclusion

Culture and values must foster diversity and inclusion by promoting respect and appreciation for different cultures, beliefs, and perspectives. This includes celebrating the richness of human diversity and creating opportunities for individuals and communities to learn from one another and to work together towards shared goals and values.

#### 18.3 Celebrating Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom

Culture and values must celebrate and embody the principles of truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom in all aspects of life. This includes promoting a culture of honesty, integrity, and transparency, and creating opportunities for personal and collective growth and development that align with these values.

#### 18.4 Promoting Education and Learning

Culture and values must promote education and learning as key tools for personal and collective growth and development. This includes promoting access to education and learning opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, and creating opportunities for lifelong learning and personal growth.

#### 18.5 Nurturing Creativity and Imagination

Culture and values must nurture creativity and imagination as essential components of personal and collective growth and development. This includes creating opportunities for artistic expression, storytelling, and cultural exchange, and promoting the development of new ideas, approaches, and technologies that advance the values and goals of the New Vision and Plan.

#### 18.6 Transforming Cultural Systems

The New Vision and Plan must also transform cultural systems to ensure that they are aligned with the values and goals of a just, regenerative, and prosperous world. This includes redefining cultural metrics beyond consumerism and socioeconomic status, and creating new cultural systems that prioritize the well-being of individuals, communities, and the planet over short-term gratification.

Culture and values have a critical role in implementing the New Vision and Plan for humanity. By promoting the values of the New Vision and Plan, fostering diversity and inclusion, celebrating truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom, promoting education and learning, nurturing creativity and imagination, and transforming cultural systems, they can contribute to a more just, regenerative, and prosperous world for all.

To achieve these goals, we must build a culture that supports and reinforces the New Vision and Plan. This requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that engages individuals, communities, organizations, and governments in a process of cultural transformation. Together, we can create a world where culture and values are forces for good, where diversity is celebrated, and where all people have the opportunity to thrive.
