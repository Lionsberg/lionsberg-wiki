# 2.1 The Origins of the Lionsberg System and Approach

The Lionsberg System and Approach is the result of the work of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and dozens of others to bring together decades of research, collaboration, and experimentation by a global array of experts, activists, and leaders across various fields. Building on the work and insights of visionary thinkers in both ancient and modern times, the Lionsberg System and Approach was created to facilitate a global transformation, within a 10 year period, of the fundamental human operating system. This fundamental transformation is centered around realigning all physical and metaphysical resources and capabilities exclusively and systematically in service of flourishing and abundant life. This requires the acknowledgement that the Old System is failing, exploitative, and corrupt, and that an entirely reimagined and redesigned New System is required. 

The New System must realign all human systems and intelligence in service of co-creating a better future for All, including all creatures and ecosystems of the Living System that contains and sustains all generations of human and non-human life. 

The Lionsberg System and Approach is the product of a collective effort to re-envision and co-create a New Operating System for humanity that is capable of addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and forging from its ashes a better future for all.

The Lionsberg System and Approach is rooted in the understanding that the Meta Crisis is not just a set of isolated issues, but a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution. It recognizes that the Old Operating System, which is dominated by soulless legal abstractions (governments and corporations) and is therefore inherently based on self-interested exploitation and war, is not capable of addressing the Meta Crisis. Therefore, it calls for a fundamental transformation of human systems and intelligence, from the current paradigm of exploitation and warfare to one of continuously improving livingry and wellbeing of all life.

The Lionsberg System and Approach is also based on the recognition that the Meta Crisis is an unprecedented challenge that requires an unprecedented and immediate solution. It acknowledges that what got us here will not get us to where we all want to go, and that a New Vision and Plan is needed to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and create a better future for all.

It emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and holistic approach, which addresses the interrelated and interconnected nature of the Meta Crisis, and the need for transparency, accountability, and participation in decision-making processes that will determine the future quality and viability of life for all human citizens on earth. It also highlights the importance of collective action and collaboration, both locally and globally, to co-create the best possible future for all.
