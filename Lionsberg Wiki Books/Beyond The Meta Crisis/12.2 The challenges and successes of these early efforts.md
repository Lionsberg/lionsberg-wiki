# 12.2 The challenges and successes of these early efforts

The early efforts of the rising movement to confront the grand challenges and co-create a better future were met with a number of challenges. One of the main challenges was the lack of awareness and understanding of the Meta Crisis among the general public. Many people were not aware of the severity and complexity of the issues that the Meta Crisis encompasses, and as a result, were not motivated to take action.

Another challenge was the lack of unity and coordination among the various groups and individuals who were working on the Meta Crisis. There was a lack of a shared vision, goals, and coordinated planning, and as a result, the efforts of these groups were often fragmented and disjointed.

Additionally, the early efforts of the rising movement were met with resistance from those with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. This included resistance from powerful corporations and governments who were unwilling to make the necessary changes to address the Meta Crisis, and whose positions and power were threatened by the light being shone in on corrupt practices. 

Despite these challenges, the early efforts of the rising movement achieved some important successes. One of the main successes was the increased awareness and understanding of the Meta Crisis among the general public. The rising movement was able to raise awareness about the issues through various means such as social media, grassroots campaigns, and public events.

Another success was the formation of various coalitions and partnerships among different groups and individuals working on the Meta Crisis. These collaborations helped to increase the effectiveness and impact of the rising movement's efforts.

Additionally, the early efforts of the rising movement were able to achieve some tangible results in addressing the Meta Crisis, such as the implementation of policies and regulations aimed at reducing environmental harm, and the development of sustainable and regenerative technologies.

Further, the rising movement led to the beginning of a shift of consciousness around both philanthropy and investing, with a leading edge of capital holders coming to see the importance of transforming the way they were stewarding and deploying capital. 

Finally and most importantly, the bold actions and speech of early leaders in the rising movement allowed them to identify and connect with one another, creating the rich ecosystem of relationships and awareness that will make all the comes next possible. 

In summary, the early efforts of the rising movement were met with a number of challenges, but were also able to achieve important successes in raising awareness, beginning to coordinate the efforts of different groups, and achieving early policy and public opinion wins in addressing the Meta Crisis.
