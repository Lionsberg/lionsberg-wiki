# 30.3 Lessons learned and insights gained

The journey towards implementing the New Vision and Plan has been a valuable learning experience, yielding important lessons and insights that can inform future efforts to address the Meta Crisis.

One of the key lessons learned is the importance of effective communication and education in building support for the New Vision and Plan. Many of the challenges faced have been rooted in a lack of understanding and awareness of the Meta Crisis and the urgency of the situation, as well as a lack of understanding and awareness of the New Vision, System, and Plan. Through targeted communication and education campaigns, the rising movement is working to raise awareness and build support among individuals, organizations, and communities. 

Another lesson learned is that unenlightened people struggle to design and build enlightened organizations and structures. Everything that we think, say, and do flows from the fundamental state of our consciousness. Through deep dialogue and action leading to new insights and discoveries, the rising movement is slowly expanding its own consciousness, while discerning and developing programs of experiential learning to help facilitate the emergence of expanding consciousness among all members of society. 

Another important lesson learned is the power of grassroots mobilization and community engagement. By engaging individuals and communities at the local level, the rising movement has been able to build momentum and pressure politicians and policy makers in various parts of the world to take action. This has been a powerful demonstration of how collective action can drive change, even in the face of severe resistance and opposition.

The importance of collaboration and coordination among different actors has also been a valuable insight. With each small effort to connect and align the efforts of individuals, organizations, and communities in greater ways, the rising movement has been able to achieve increased impact and efficiency in implementing the New Vision and Plan. This has highlighted the importance of developing technologies, platforms, and mechanisms for awareness, communication, and coordination. 

Another insight gained is that it is important to anticipate and prepare for resistance and backlash from those invested in the Old System. Those who have been exposed to the deceit and corruption of the Old System have been met with various forms of retaliation, including financial and reputation losses, social rejection, strained relationships with family and friends, and even death. This has highlighted the importance of creating support systems and safe spaces for those who speak out and advocate for change. 

Lastly, an insight that has been gained is the eternal and universal nature of this struggle, that this is not a new struggle. It is not the first time that a society has been called to arise and transform, and it will not be the last. The struggle for the New Vision and Plan is the eternal and universal struggle for the soul of humanity, and it will continue until we all awaken and arise as one. The insight that has been gained is that the greatest power that we have is the power of the Central Animating Spirit that is causing us all to awaken, arise, and advance towards The Goal. This is the power that has brought us to where we are, and it is the power that will bring us to the other side. 

In summary, the journey towards implementing the New Vision and Plan has been challenging but has yielded innumerable valuable insights and lessons that can inform future efforts to address the Meta Crisis and co-create the New World. By raising awareness and building support, engaging in grassroots mobilization, fostering collaboration, building capacity, preparing for resistance and backlash, and recognizing the eternal nature of this struggle, the rising movement has been able to make significant progress in overcoming the obstacles and working towards the regenerating and renewed paradise Earth is intended to become.
