Education plays a crucial role in implementing the New Vision and Plan for humanity. Its potential to empower individuals and communities with knowledge and skills is immense, but it must be harnessed in a way that is aligned with the values and goals of the New Vision and Plan.

#### 20.1 Advancing Regenerativity

Education can advance regenerativity by promoting an understanding of ecological systems, sustainable practices, and the principles of regenerative design. This includes providing education and training in renewable energy technologies, sustainable agriculture practices, and regenerative design principles that prioritize the health of ecosystems and the well-being of individuals and communities.

#### 20.2 Empowering Individuals and Communities

Education can empower individuals and communities by providing them with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions and take action towards implementing the New Vision and Plan. This includes providing access to education and training opportunities that increase access to essential resources and services, promote economic empowerment, and provide basic needs such as food, water, and shelter to those in need.

#### 20.3 Celebrating Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom

Education can celebrate truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom by instilling these values in individuals and communities. This includes promoting critical thinking and ethical decision-making, fostering empathy and compassion, and promoting an understanding of the interconnectedness of all life.

#### 20.4 Supporting Lifelong Learning

Education can support lifelong learning by providing individuals and communities with access to educational resources throughout their lives. This includes providing opportunities for ongoing education and training, as well as access to online and virtual learning platforms that can facilitate lifelong learning and development.

#### 20.5 Addressing Systemic Inequalities

Education can address systemic inequalities by promoting social and economic justice, and providing opportunities for marginalized and underrepresented groups to access education and training. This includes addressing barriers to education such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and discrimination, and providing additional support and resources to individuals and communities that face these challenges.

#### 20.6 Fostering Creativity and Imagination

Education can foster creativity and imagination by providing opportunities for artistic expression, storytelling, and cultural exchange. This includes promoting the arts and humanities, providing access to creative tools and resources, and supporting cultural exchange programs that celebrate diversity and promote understanding.

Education plays a critical role in implementing the New Vision and Plan for humanity. By advancing regenerativity, empowering individuals and communities, celebrating truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom, supporting lifelong learning, addressing systemic inequalities, and fostering creativity and imagination, it can contribute to a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all.

To achieve the objectives of the New Vision and Plan, it is vital to reimagine, redesign, and rebuild an education system that supports and reinforces our New goals and strategies. This requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that equips and empowers all individuals and communities with the knowledge and skills they need to advance, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
