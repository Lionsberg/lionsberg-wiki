# 6.3 Key Steps and Milestones for the 7-year Window of Opportunity

The Lionsberg Strategy is designed to be implemented within a 7-year window of opportunity, from 2023 to 2030. Due to both physical and metaphysical factors, this window of opportunity is considered critical in addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The strategy is designed to be a continuously improving recursive cycle that will be unfolding progressively and recursively around the world in parallel along cycles of varying duration in different times, places, and domains.

The key steps and milestones for the 7-year window of opportunity include:

- Step 1: Articulating the New Vision and Plan: This step focuses on clearly defining and articulating the New Vision and Plan, including the principles, values, and goals that guide the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach. This step has been progressed through at universal and global scales by the Core Enterprise, which will now support and empower citizen-led efforts to lead the process in the various localities and domains around the world.

- Step 2: Analyzing Existing Forces and Conditions: This step focuses on analyzing existing forces and conditions, including the current state of human and living systems, the root causes of the Meta Crisis, and the opportunities and challenges that must be addressed in order to co-create the best possible future for All. The Core Enterprise has also progressed through this step at universal and global levels, and will now support and empower citizen-led efforts to analyze existing forces and conditions in their localities and domains.

- Step 3: Building the Foundation: This step focuses on building the foundation for the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach, including the development of the necessary infrastructure, technologies, and systems. This step has also been progressed through by the Core Enterprise in order to reach the 2023 Starting Point, and will now be scaled up and supported by citizen-led efforts in various localities and domains.

- Step 4: Engaging and Mobilizing Stakeholders: This step focuses on engaging and mobilizing individuals, communities, organizations, and governments to participate in the implementation of the strategy. This includes developing and implementing strategies to increase participation and engagement, as well as creating opportunities for collaboration and partnership. This has been done by the Core Enterprise in a loose and informal way, and is being formalized in January 2023. 

- Step 5: Curating, Developing and Implementing Solutions and Plans: This step focuses on curating, developing and implementing solutions and plans for the key components of the Lionsberg System, including environmental stewardship, social and economic justice, governance and political reform, and Human System and Living System Monitoring and Alignment. This step also includes the citizen-led efforts of local communities, organizations and governments as they co-create, implement, evaluate, and cross-pollinate solutions that align with the New Vision and Plan.

- Step 6: Monitoring and Evaluating Progress: This step focuses on monitoring and evaluating the progress of the strategy, including the development of metrics and indicators to measure progress and the identification of areas for improvement. This step is critical as a baseline for the continuous improvement of quality and value, and continuous reduction of waste and cost, across all aspects of the system, relative to The Goal of the New System. 

-   Step 7: Refining, Adapting and Improving the Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan: This step focuses on continuously refining, adapting, and improving the Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan based on the results of the monitoring and evaluation as well as new information, insights, and technologies that become available to this and subsequent generations. This step is critical to ensure the strategy remains a living work that is responsive to the changing conditions and needs of the world across all generations of life in all times and all places during the coming millennium. 

It is important to note that each of these steps is not a linear process, but rather a continuous cycle that will be repeated multiple times as individuals, communities, organizations, and governments work towards highest order functional unity. Each individual citizen will grapple with these cycles repeatedly in their own lives, while also experiencing them in the organizations and communities they are a part of. The more individuals, communities, organizations, and governments go through these cycles, the more their awareness, understanding, and wisdom will grow as they live into the New Vision, System, and Plan.

The implementation of the Lionsberg Strategy will require significant financial and human resources, as well as the commitment and effort of all stakeholders. However, the long-term benefits of creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth make it a not only a worthwhile, but also a spiritually and ethically imperative investment. The Core Enterprise, as well as the citizen-led efforts, will work together to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy within the 7-year window of opportunity. It is important that all stakeholders work together in trust, transparency, and accountability to achieve the common goal of highest order functional unity and a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.
