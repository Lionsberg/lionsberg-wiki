The key elements of the New Vision and Plan include:

-   Principles and values that guide the vision and plan, including truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom. These principles and values provide a foundation for the vision and plan, and they reflect the ideals and aspirations of the awakened generation.
    
-   Goals that are focused on creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. These goals include creating a more sustainable, just, and harmonious world, as well as addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and preventing future crises.
    
-   A scope and scale that is comprehensive and global in nature. The New Vision and Plan recognizes that the Meta Crisis is a global challenge that requires a global response. It is designed to be applicable to individuals, communities, and governments around the world, and it is intended to create a more united and harmonious world.
    
-   Strategies that are focused on addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis, rather than just the symptoms. These strategies include a range of approaches, such as economic justice and reform, social justice and reform, environmental justice and reform, governance and political reform, development and wellbeing justice and reform, energy justice and reform, and infrastructure justice and reform.
    
-   Components that are designed to be practical and actionable, and that provide individuals, communities, and governments with the tools and resources they need to take meaningful and effective action. These components include a range of resources, such as guides, toolkits, training materials, and more.
