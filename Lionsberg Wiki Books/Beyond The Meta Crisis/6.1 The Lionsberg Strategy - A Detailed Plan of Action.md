# 6.1 The Lionsberg Strategy - A Detailed Plan of Action

The Lionsberg Strategy includes a comprehensive plan of action for the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach in accordance with the New Vision and Plan, which aims to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The strategy is designed to be implemented within the 7-year window of opportunity from 2023 through 2030, and focuses on the gradual and voluntary rise of consciousness and collaboration towards higher order functional unity.

Some key steps and milestones of the strategy include:

-   Step 1: Building the foundation: This step focuses on creating the necessary infrastructure, technologies, and systems to support the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach within a 7 year period. This includes the development of the resources, solutions, technologies and relationships that will be needed to implement the strategy. This step was primarily completed between 2017 and Q1 2023.
    
-   Step 2: Mobilizing stakeholders: This step focuses on engaging and mobilizing individuals, communities, organizations, and governments to participate in the implementation of the strategy. This includes developing and implementing strategies to increase participation and engagement, as well as creating opportunities for collaboration and partnership.
    
-   Step 3: Curating, Developing and Implementing Solutions: This step focuses on curating, developing and implementing solutions for the key components of the Lionsberg System as part of the Prototype, including solutions relating to environmental stewardship, social and economic justice, governance and political reform, and Living System Monitoring and Alignment.
    
-   Step 4: Monitoring and evaluation: This step focuses on monitoring and evaluating the progress of the strategy, including the development of metrics and indicators to measure progress and the identification of areas for improvement.
    
-   Step 5: Refining and adapting the Vision, Strategy, and Plan: This step focuses on refining and adapting the strategy as necessary, based on the results of the monitoring and evaluation as the strategy progresses.
    
-   Step 6: Achieving highest functional unity: This step focuses on achieving highest order functional unity, and ensuring that all physical and metaphysical resources and capabilities are aligned and working together without exception in service of flourishing and abundant life for All. 

The Lionsberg Strategy is designed as a collaborative citizen led effort that involves the participation of individuals, communities, organizations, and governments from all sectors of society. The importance of citizen led engagement and participation cannot be overstated in the implementation of the strategy. If citizens do not awaken, arise, and take lead in unison in accordance with the New Vision and Plan, the strategy will fail because it is inherently unable to violate the free will of citizens or be implemented from the top down by existing structures of leadership and governance. The strategy is intended to perpetually remain a living work that must be continuously updated and refined as new information, insights, and technologies become available to this and subsequent generations. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of clear and effective communication, so that all stakeholders are informed and aware of the progress and changes being made. It also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability, to ensure that all stakeholders are held responsible for their actions and contributions towards the implementation of the strategy. This will be accomplished through a combination of dashboards and quantitative monitoring, as well as deep listening and analysis of qualitative and experiential stories and narrative descriptions from stakeholders around the world. 

Furthermore, the strategy also acknowledges that the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach will require significant financial and human resources, and as such, it includes a detailed plan for funding and resource allocation. This includes the development of innovative funding mechanisms and partnerships with the private sector, plans and structures for a series of citizen led public private joint ventures, as well as the creation of a robust and sustainable funding and endowment structure to support the ongoing implementation of the Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan across subsequent generations. 

In summary, the Lionsberg Strategy is a comprehensive and holistic plan of action for the implementation of the Lionsberg System and Approach as a means to accomplish the New Vision and Plan, that aims to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It focuses on the gradual rise of all things towards highest order functional unity and it is designed to be implemented within the 7-year window of opportunity between 2023 and 2030. The strategy emphasizes the importance of citizen led engagement and participation, collaboration and partnerships, and transparency and accountability. It also includes a detailed plan for funding and resource allocation, and it is intended to be a living work that is continuously updated and refined.
