These acceptance criteria for a comprehensive New System and Approach provide a clear roadmap for addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. They highlight the importance of taking a holistic and integrated perspective, prioritizing long-term regenerative capacity, fostering collaboration and partnership, promoting inclusivity and justice, and building adaptability and resilience.

It is important to note that while the Lionsberg System is presented as an example of a comprehensive New System and Approach that meets these criteria, other systems and approaches may also meet these criteria and be effective in addressing the Meta Crisis. It is imperative to note that our duty is not to any one System and Approach, but to working together to accomplish the Vision and Goal in the name of [[One And All]]. If a better System and Approach is identified, available, and ready to be deployed, we will gladly lay the Lionsberg System aside and adopt it if that is the wise right thing to do. 

The key is that the New System and Approach must be comprehensive, cohesive, and inclusive, and must prioritize long-term sustainability, wellbeing and regenerative capacity for all, and align with a new paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet across all generations of life. By weighing all proposed solutions, systems and approaches against an objective set of acceptance criteria like the ones outlined above, humanity can ensure that it is choosing a System and Approach most likely to help it succeed and avoid failure at this pivotal moment of existential crisis.
