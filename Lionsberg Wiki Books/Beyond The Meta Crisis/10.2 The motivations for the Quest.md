# 10.2 The motivations for the Quest

The Quest for the best and highest Destiny is driven by a deep desire for a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. The Meta Crisis has made it clear that the current systems and approaches are not working, and that a new way of thinking, planning, and acting is needed to address the root causes of the crisis and co-create the best possible future for all. The Quest is motivated by a sense of urgency to address the Meta Crisis and a belief that a better future is possible.

Additionally, the Quest is motivated by a desire for personal and collective growth and development. The Meta Crisis presents an opportunity for humanity to evolve and become a more conscious, compassionate, and wise species operating in service to One and All. The Quest is an opportunity to transcend the limitations of the past and co-create a future that is in alignment with our highest and most noble shared values and aspirations.

Furthermore, the Quest is motivated by a sense of interconnection and interdependence. The Meta Crisis has shown that the fate of humanity is intimately connected to the fate of all life on Earth. The Quest is an opportunity to work together to address the Meta Crisis and create a future that is regenerative and flourishing for all.

Ultimately, the Quest for the best and highest Destiny is motivated by a desire for a better future for all, a desire for personal and collective growth and development, a sense of interconnection and interdependence, and a belief that co-creating a better future is not possible, but a moral and ethical imperative.
