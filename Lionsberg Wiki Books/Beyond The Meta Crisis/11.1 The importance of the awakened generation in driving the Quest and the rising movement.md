# 11.1 The importance of the awakened generation in driving the Quest and the rising movement

The awakened generation plays a crucial role in driving the Quest and the rising movement forward. This generation, also known as the "Meta Crisis generation," has been shaped by the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of the current era. They have been exposed to the systemic and structural issues that are at the root of the Meta Crisis, and have a deep understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of these issues.

This understanding has led to a sense of urgency and a desire for meaningful and lasting change. The awakened generation is motivated by a desire to co-create a better future for themselves, their communities, and future generations. They are driven by a sense of purpose and a desire to make a positive impact on the world.

The awakened generation is also characterized by a willingness to take action and to be agents of change. They are not content to wait for change to happen, but are actively working to co-create a better future. They are creative, innovative, and willing to think outside the box to find solutions to the Meta Crisis.

Furthermore, the awakened generation is also inclusive, compassionate and recognizes the importance of diversity and socioeconomic justice. They understand that a better future for all can only be achieved when the needs and perspectives of all members of society are taken into account, and when all citizens have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. 

The awakened generation is also characterized by a willingness to collaborate and build partnerships across sectors and disciplines. They understand that the Meta Crisis requires a comprehensive and cohesive response, and that this can only be achieved through collective and collaborative efforts.

In summary, the awakened generation is a powerful force for change, driven by a sense of purpose, a desire for meaningful and lasting transformational impact, and a willingness to take action and collaborate to co-create a better future. Their role in driving the Quest and the rising movement is essential to achieving a better future for humanity and all life on Earth.
