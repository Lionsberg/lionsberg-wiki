# 28.4 The role of the rising movement in co-creating the future we seek

The rising movement, composed of individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds and sectors around the world, plays a crucial role in co-creating the future we seek as outlined in the New Vision and Plan. The movement represents a powerful force for change and is driving the shift towards a more just, regenerative, and abundant future for All.

One of the key roles of the rising movement is to raise awareness and build momentum for the New Vision and Plan. Through grassroots organizing and collective action, the movement can help to create a sense of urgency and popular support for the changes outlined in New Vision and Plan. This can help to create the political will and public demand necessary to bring about the transformative changes we need to see in all places and times relatively simultaneously. 

Another important role of the rising movement is to serve as a catalyst for innovation and experimentation. The movement can help to incubate and scale new models and approaches that align with the principles of the New Vision and Plan. This can include everything from new economic models and citizen led development initiatives, to new technologies and approaches to governance. 

The movement also plays a key role in building the capacity and resilience of individuals and communities. Through education, training, and capacity-building programs, the movement can help to empower individuals and communities to take ownership of their own development and well-being. This can help to create a culture of citizen-led initiative and self-reliance in the context of our universal inter-existence, which is essential for the long-term success of the New Vision and Plan.

The rising movement also serves as a means for collaboration and co-creation among diverse stakeholders. The movement brings together individuals and groups from different sectors and backgrounds to work together towards a common goal. This can help to build bridges across divides and to create a sense of shared purpose and common ground among different groups.

In conclusion, the rising movement plays a crucial role in co-creating the future we seek as outlined in the New Vision and Plan. By raising awareness, driving innovation, building capacity, and fostering collaboration, the movement is a powerful force for change that is helping to bring about a more just, regenerative, and abundant future for all.
