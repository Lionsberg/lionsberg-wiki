# 2.2 The Purpose and Goals of the Lionsberg System and Approach

The purpose of the Lionsberg System and Approach is to provide a comprehensive and holistic solution to the Meta Crisis by addressing its root causes and transforming the human operating systems from the Old to the New. By re-envisioning and co-creating a [[New Operating System]] for humanity, the Lionsberg System and Approach aims to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis, prevent future crises, and create a better future for All.

The goals of the Lionsberg System and Approach are to:

-   Create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth by addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and preventing future crises
-   Align all physical and metaphysical resources and capabilities exclusively and systematically in service of flourishing and abundant life
-   Acknowledge that the Old System is failing, exploitative, and corrupt, and that an entirely reimagined and redesigned New System is required
-   Realign all human systems and intelligence in service of co-creating a flourishing and abundant future for all
-   Address the Meta Crisis as a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution
-   Create a new paradigm for human systems and intelligence, based on livingry and wellbeing of all life, rather than exploitation and warfare
-   Provide a comprehensive and holistic solution to the Meta Crisis that is based on transparency, accountability, and citizen led decision-making processes
-   Facilitate a global transformation, within a 10 year period, of the fundamental human operating system
-   Ensure that the New System is capable of addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and creating a better future for all, by addressing issues such as poverty, economic inequality, social injustice, discrimination, disease, and unjust governance and political systems. 
-   Ensure that the New System is entirely realigned and rebalanced with the Living System that contains and sustains it. 

The Lionsberg System and Approach is a bold and ambitious plan that aims to bring about a fundamental change in the way we live, work, and relate to one another and our planet. It recognizes that the challenges facing humanity today are interconnected and require a holistic approach. The Lionsberg System and Approach aims to create a new paradigm for human systems and intelligence, one that is based on the principles of truth, love, justice, stewardship, wisdom, and the temporal and eternal flourishing of all life. It is rooted in the understanding that the Meta Crisis is not just a set of isolated issues, but a systemic problem that requires a systemic solution. The goal is to create a new operating system for humanity that is capable of addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis and creating a better future for all. This will be achieved by re-aligning all physical and metaphysical resources and capabilities exclusively and systematically in service of flourishing and abundant life, creating a new paradigm for human systems and intelligence based on livingry and wellbeing of all life, while providing a comprehensive and holistic solution to the Meta Crisis that is based on transparency, accountability, and citizen led decision-making processes.
