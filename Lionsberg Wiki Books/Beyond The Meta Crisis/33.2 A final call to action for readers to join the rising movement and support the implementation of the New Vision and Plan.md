# 33.2 A final call to action for readers to join the rising movement and support the implementation of the New Vision and Plan

As you reach the end of [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], we invite you to reflect on the themes, ideas, and possibilities presented in this book. The Meta Crisis is a defining challenge of our time, but it also offers an unprecedented opportunity for humanity to come together and consciously create a brighter future for all life on Earth.

We urge you to join the rising movement and support the implementation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[Lionsberg System]]. No effort is too small, and every individual has a unique role to play in this collective journey towards a just, regenerative, and flourishing world.

Consider the ways in which you can contribute to the movement, such as:

1.  Educating yourself and others about the Meta Crisis and the New Vision and Plan.
2.  Taking local action to address the challenges in your community.
3.  Advocating for policy changes and systemic solutions at every level.
4.  Supporting organizations and initiatives aligned with the New Vision and Plan.
5.  Connecting with like-minded individuals, communities, and networks.
6.  Reflecting on your personal habits and lifestyle choices, and adopting more sustainable and regenerative practices.
7.  Organizing events and spaces for dialogue, learning, and collaboration. 
8. Supporting [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and [[Lionsberg]] in their efforts to inspire, serve and empower citizens around the world. 

Let us stand together in solidarity, creativity, and determination as we work towards a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. We have the knowledge, the tools, and the vision to overcome the Meta Crisis and build a world where peace, wisdom, justice, regenerativity, and flourishing are the norm.

Now is the time to act. Join the rising movement, and let us co-create the future we all desire and deserve.
