# 16.2 The goals of the New Vision and Plan

1.  Address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and prevent future crises
2.  Create a more just and equitable world for all people
3.  Promote the well-being and flourishing of all life on Earth
4.  Foster sustainability, harmony, and balance in all aspects of life
5.  Encourage the development and expression of individual and collective potential
6.  Promote peace, cooperation, and understanding among all people and nations
7.  Foster the evolution of humanity towards its highest and best destiny
8.  Create a world that is guided by the principles of truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom. 
9. Create a world in which all creation flourishes in harmony and right relationship with one another and its Source.  
10. Create a New Era for All that is superior in every way to the past millennia we are leaving behind. 

Beyond these basic universal aspirations, the New Vision and Plan honor and will track progress against various ontologies and targets that humanity has already agreed to, such the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This will be done while simultaneously taking a far more comprehensive approach than has previously been contemplated in addressing the true root causes of suffering and dysfunction facing humanity.
