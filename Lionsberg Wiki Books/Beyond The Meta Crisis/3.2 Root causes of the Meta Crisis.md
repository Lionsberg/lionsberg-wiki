# 3.2 Root causes of the Meta Crisis

The root causes of the Meta Crisis are complex and multifaceted, and they can be traced back to a variety of factors. One of the main root causes is the way that humanity has organized itself, and the way it has interacted with and impacted the natural world. The exploitation of natural resources and the destruction of ecosystems has led to environmental degradation, which is a major contributor to the Meta Crisis. Additionally, the competitive pursuit of profit, power, and growth at all costs has led to social inequality and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few, which has contributed to a range of social and economic issues.

Another major root cause of the Meta Crisis is the way that power is distributed and exercised in society. The concentration of power in the hands of a few has led to the erosion of true participation in the decisions that effect our lives and our world, and the suppression of human rights, which has contributed to social unrest and political polarization. Additionally, the influence of special interests and the corporate and financial sectors on politics has led to damaging policies that prioritize short-term gain over long-term sustainability and the common good.

The Meta Crisis is also the result of a lack of awareness and understanding of the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. The failure to recognize the interdependence of humans, other living beings, and the natural world has led to a disconnection from the natural world and a lack of appreciation for the value of all life. This has contributed to a range of issues, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and a lack of harmony and unity among humanity. 

Fundamentally, it is an issue of the way of being and core operating systems of the human species, which are woefully out of alignment with the universal law of love and the principles and boundaries governing our eternally regenerative living system that must give rise to and sustain all generations of life.
