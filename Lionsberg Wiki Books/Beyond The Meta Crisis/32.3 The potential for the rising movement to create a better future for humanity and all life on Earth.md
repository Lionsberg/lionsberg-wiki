# 32.3 The potential for the rising movement to create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth

The rising movement, built on the foundation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] and empowered by the [[LIONSBERG System]], holds immense potential to transform our world and create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. By addressing the Meta Crisis and implementing the Pattern Language of the New World, the movement can bring about positive changes on every level of analysis, leading to a future that is brighter for All, than it has been for anyone in the past:

1.  **Social and Economic Justice**: By accelerating policies and structural transformations that promote social and economic justice, the rising movement can help to reduce inequality, poverty, and marginalization. This, in turn, will create more just and inclusive societies where every citizen has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the common good.
    
2.  **Environmental Stewardship**: The movement's focus on regenerative development and environmental stewardship will foster an eternally sustainable relationship with our planet and the complex living system that sustains us. This includes cultivating biodiversity, protecting ecosystems, healing environmental damage, and mitigating the impacts of environmental changes for current and future generations.
    
3.  **Resilient Communities**: By empowering individuals, organizations and communities to take local action and build networks of support, the rising movement can create stronger, more connected, and more resilient communities. These communities will be strengthened and better equipped to withstand and adapt to the challenges posed by the Meta Crisis and other global issues, while emerging into a positive new era of local and collective flourishing.
    
4.  **Systemic Change**: The rising movement's emphasis on addressing the underlying systems and structures that caused and perpetuate the Meta Crisis will enable transformative change at the deepest levels. By reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding these systems, we can create a more just, regenerative, and flourishing world for all current and future generations.
    
5.  **Global Solidarity**: By fostering local and global connections and working together across borders and the other lines that have divided us in the past, the rising movement can promote a sense of shared responsibility and mutual support. This will encourage collaboration, wisdom and knowledge exchange, and the development of solutions that benefit all life on Earth.
    
6.  **Innovation and Creativity**: The movement's support for innovation and creativity can lead to the development of new technologies, business models, and social systems that address all dimensions of both the Meta Crisis, and the flourishing New Era we forge together. This will drive progress towards The Goal, and help to create a just, regenerative and resilient future for All. 
    
7.  **Education and Empowerment**: By emphasizing education, outreach, and engagement of all citizens, the rising movement can empower individuals and communities to become active participants in shaping their own futures. This will create a more wise, informed and engaged global citizenry, capable of navigating society and our planet towards the Brighter Future we all seek.
    
8.  **Cultural Transformation**: The rising movement has the potential to spark a cultural shift towards values that prioritize the eternal well-being of all life and society on Earth. This transformation will encourage a more loving, just, and responsible approach to our interactions with each other and the planet.
    
9. **Progressive Enlightenment**: The rising movement has the potential to liberate all citizens from the bondage of whatever degrees of ignorance or falsehood are holding them back. This movement has the potential to flood the earth like floodwaters with Truth, Light, and Love, creating the potential for a more enlightened, wise and compassionate human species to work together to forge the Best Possible Future for All. 
    
10. **Peace, Harmony, and Abundance**: The rising movement and the New Vision and Plan have the potential to create an entirely New Era of peace, harmony, and abundance for All.  For the first time in human history, we have the connections, the wisdom, the knowledge, and the tools and technology to solve the deepest causes of pain, suffering, and privation, creating the conditions for a New Era of flourishing prosperity for All. 

By harnessing the potential of the rising movement, we can create a better future for humanity and all life on Earthâ€”one that is based on Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, and Right Relationship between One and All. The journey ahead will be challenging, but the rewards will be well worth the effort.
