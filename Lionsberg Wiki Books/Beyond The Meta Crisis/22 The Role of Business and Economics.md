# 22 The Role of Business and Economics

Business and economics play a critical role in implementing the New Vision and Plan for humanity. They have the power to influence the behavior of individuals, organizations, and governments, and can drive progress towards a more just, regenerative, and prosperous world.

#### 22.1 Promoting Regenerative Business Practices

Businesses must adopt regenerative practices that prioritize the health of ecosystems and the well-being of individuals and communities. This includes reducing waste and pollution, promoting regenerative agriculture and land use practices, and using renewable energy and resources. By adopting these practices, businesses can contribute to a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all.

#### 22.2 Supporting Social and Economic Justice

Businesses must support social and economic justice by promoting fair labor practices, providing living wages and benefits to workers, sharing profits and resource flows justly, and investing in local communities and the environment. This includes promoting justice in all aspects of the workplace and supply chain, and ensuring that the entire socioeconomic system is wise, just and good. 

#### 22.3 Advancing the Regenerative Economy

Businesses must advance the regenerative economy by developing new products and services that support regenerative practices and technologies. This includes investing in research and development of new materials and technologies, and partnering with other businesses, organizations, and governments to advance the regenerative economy.

#### 22.4 Promoting Transparency and Accountability

Businesses must promote transparency and accountability by reporting on their actions and policies, and ensuring that they are open and honest in their decision-making processes. This includes reporting on their environmental and social impact, use of resources, and engaging in dialogue with stakeholders to understand and address their perspectives and concerns.

#### 22.5 Investing in Innovation and Creativity

Businesses must invest in innovation and creativity by developing new products, services, and approaches that advance the values and goals of the New Vision and Plan. This includes investing in research and development, and fostering a culture of creativity and innovation within their organizations.

#### 22.6 Transforming Economic Systems

The New Vision and Plan must also transform economic systems to ensure that they are aligned with the values and goals of a just, regenerative, and prosperous world. This includes redefining economic metrics beyond profit, growth and GDP, promoting circular economies, and creating new systems that prioritize the well-being of individuals, communities, and the planet over short-term profits.

Business and economics have a critical role in implementing the New Vision and Plan for humanity. By promoting regenerative business practices, supporting social and economic justice, advancing the regenerative economy, promoting transparency and accountability, investing in innovation and creativity, and transforming economic systems, they can contribute to a more just, regenerative, and prosperous world for all.

To achieve these goals, we must build a business and economic system that supports and reinforces the New Vision and Plan. This requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that engages individuals, communities, organizations, and governments in a process of business and economic transformation. Together, we can create a world where business and economics are forces for good, where prosperity is shared, and where all people have the opportunity to thrive.
