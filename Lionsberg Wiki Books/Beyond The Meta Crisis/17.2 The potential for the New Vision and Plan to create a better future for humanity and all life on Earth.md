# 17.2 The potential for the New Vision and Plan to create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth

Once a better Aim can be articulated and envisioned, it can be progressively realized through the conscious agency of humanity. 

The New Vision and Plan, if fully and voluntarily implemented by humanity, has the potential to create a better future for humanity and all generations of life on Earth. By addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis, the New Vision and Plan can bring about a more just, sustainable, and equitable world for all.

The New Vision and Plan addresses the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to the Meta Crisis, by addressing the multiple dimensions of the crisis such as environmental stewardship, poverty, economic inequality, social injustice, discrimination, and political corruption. It also prioritizes the protection, preservation, and restoration of the natural environment, and the transition to clean and renewable energy, and regenerative and circular economic models.

The New Vision and Plan also prioritizes the well-being of individuals and communities, by providing access to the resources, tools, knowledge, and support needed for individuals to develop towards the fullness of their potential and for communities to govern themselves and take control of their own welfare and development. The Universal Jubilee and Commitment Based Universal Basic Income also play a critical role in addressing poverty and economic inequality, and providing citizen led safety nets for individuals and communities.

Additionally, the New Vision and Plan promotes the creation of just and enlightened governance and political systems that are transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs and aspirations of all individuals and communities. This includes fundamental reforms to existing structures of governance and politics, such as the creation of more representative, participatory, and decentralized systems of government, the establishment of citizen-led oversight and accountability mechanisms, and the decentralization of power to ensure that decisions are made at the most appropriate level.

The New Vision and Plan includes provisions to ensure that every family and community on earth has access to the clean water, sanitation, shelter, clothing, energy, community, security, opportunities, and meaningful work they need to develop and flourish. 

The New Vision and Plan also promotes a more harmonious and cooperative world, by making visible the interconnectedness of all aspects of life and the development of systems and structures that support the well-being of all inhabitants of Earth, both now and for future generations. This holistic, whole systems approach has the potential to create a world that is already perfect and yet continues to get a little better every day as all generations of life work together in harmony to make it so.

Overall, the New Vision and Plan has the potential to create a better future for humanity and all generations of life on Earth, by addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis, and fundamentally transforming the human operating system into a co-operative multi-generational enterprise that promotes the well-being of individuals, communities, and the planet as a whole. It is important to note that the New Vision and Plan is not a one-time solution, but rather an ongoing process of co-creation, adaptation, and evolution as humanity progresses on its Quest beyond the Meta Crisis and towards its best and highest Destiny.
