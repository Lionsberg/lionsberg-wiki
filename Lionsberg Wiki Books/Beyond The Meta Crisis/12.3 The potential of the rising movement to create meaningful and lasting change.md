# 12.3 The potential of the rising movement to create meaningful and lasting change

The rising movement, which is characterized by the growing number of individuals and organizations that are committed to addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating a better future, has the potential to create meaningful, transformational, and enduring change.

One of the key strengths of the rising movement is its ability to bring together a wide range of actors and sectors, from governments, NGOs, and businesses, to individuals and communities. This diversity allows for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the Meta Crisis, as different actors can bring their unique perspectives, skills, and resources to the table.

Another strength of the rising movement is its willingness to think outside the box and experiment with new and innovative solutions. The complexity and interconnectedness of the Meta Crisis requires a flexible and adaptive approach, and the rising movement is well-positioned to experiment with new solutions and approaches.

The rising movement is also characterized by its emphasis on collaboration and partnership. By working together, actors and sectors can leverage their strengths and achieve more than they could on their own. This is especially important when addressing the Meta Crisis, which requires a comprehensive and cohesive response.

Moreover, the rising movement is rooted in the principles of sovereignty, autonomy, and empowerment and encourages individuals and communities to take ownership of their own development and be able to address their specific issues and pain points. This approach leads to more effective and sustainable solutions as the people who are most affected by the problem are also the ones who are most invested in solving it.

As the Meta Crisis unfolds, billions of people will be facing challenges and will benefit from being connected and empowered by a supportive community and movement purpose-built for this moment in history. As the groups of billions of people begins to rightly relate to one another, allocate resources, make decisions, and navigate wisely towards shared goals and values, and entirely new era of self-governance and coordinated action in service of One and All can dawn. When this occurs, it will be the first time in history that a distributed network of billions of citizens in hundreds of countries were motivated, equipped, and empowered to help one another advance towards shared goals and values for the good of All. This will mark a revolutionary turning point in the course of human affairs. 

However, it is important to note that transformational change is not easy or instant. The rising movement will face many dangers and challenges along the way. But with its growing momentum, its commitment to co-creation, and its diversity of actors and approaches, the rising movement has both the potential and the moral mandate to create meaningful and lasting change. The key is for all members of the movement to stay the course and continue to work together towards a common goal, despite the challenges that will inevitably arise to meet such a historic effort.
