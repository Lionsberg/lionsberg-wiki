# 28.1 The Importance of Vision and Imagination

As we stand at the brink of a global crisis, it is more important than ever that we have a clear and inspiring vision of the future we seek. The ability to imagine a better future is what drives us forward and gives us the courage and determination to make the difficult choices and sacrifices that are necessary to achieve it.

A vision of the future is not just a fanciful dream, but a powerful tool for guiding our actions and shaping our world. It provides us with a sense of direction, a sense of purpose, and a sense of hope. It allows us to see beyond the immediate challenges and difficulties that we face, and to focus on the long-term goals that will bring about a better future for our families, humanity and all life on Earth.

The New Vision and Plan is a powerful vision of the future that has been developed through the collective efforts of people from around the world. It is based on a whole systems approach that recognizes the interconnections between the different dimensions of the Meta Crisis, and that seeks to address the root causes of the crisis in a comprehensive and holistic manner so that the future can truly be flourishing, abundant and free. 

The New Vision and Plan envisions a future in which humanity lives in harmony with nature, in which all people have the opportunity to live a fulfilling and prosperous life, and in which the needs of the present are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is a future in which we have transcended the divisive and destructive Old Operating System of humanity and have adopted a new way of being and relating to the world around us.

I call on all leaders, experts, and citizens of the world to join us in imagining and clarifying this Vision of the Best Possible Future, and working together to make it our collective reality. Together, we can break the cycles of crisis and suffering that have plagued humanity for so long, and build a better future for all.
