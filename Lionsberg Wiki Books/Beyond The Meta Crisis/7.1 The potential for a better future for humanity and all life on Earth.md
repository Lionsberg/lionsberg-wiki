# 7.1 The potential for a better future for humanity and all life on Earth

The New Vision and Plan for addressing the Meta Crisis has the potential to create a better future for all humanity and all life on Earth. By addressing the root causes of the crisis and taking a holistic and integrated perspective, the New Vision and Plan has the potential to create a regenerative and flourishing future for [[All]].

One of the most significant potential benefits of a New Vision and Plan is the potential for every person on Earth to have access to everything they need to flourish. This includes basic needs such as food, water, energy, and shelter, as well as more complex needs such as wisdom, knowledge, education, healthcare, meaningful work, and meaningful relationships and social connections. A New Vision and Plan that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet can ensure that these needs are met for all people, regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances.

Another potential benefit is the potential to heal and transform the systems that have created the Meta Crisis. By addressing the root causes of the crisis and creating a new paradigm that prioritizes collective well-being and the health of the planet, the New Vision and Plan has the potential to transform the economic, political, and social systems that have created the Meta Crisis. This can lead to a more just and equitable society, as well as a healthier and more resilient planet.

Additionally, a New Vision and Plan has the potential to foster collaboration and innovation, bringing together a vast array of actors and sectors to work towards a shared vision and goal. This can lead to new and innovative solutions to the Meta Crisis, as well as the potential for fundamental transformation of the human system.

Through this process, it is possible for every person on earth to enjoy a standard of purposeful living that exceeds the standards of living that any experienced in the last millennium. 

In short, the New Vision and Plan has the potential to create a better future for humanity and all life on Earth by addressing the root causes of the Meta Crisis, creating a regenerative and flourishing future for all, healing and transforming systems, fostering collaboration and innovation, and ensuring that every person on Earth has access to everything they need to flourish.
