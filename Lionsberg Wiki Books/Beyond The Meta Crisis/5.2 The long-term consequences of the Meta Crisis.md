# 5.2 The long-term consequences of the Meta Crisis

The Meta Crisis has the potential to have long-term consequences for individuals, communities, and the world. If left unaddressed, it could lead to further environmental degradation, social inequality, political polarization, mass migration, famine, disease, and world war, which could have cascading effects on other issues such as health, education, security, socioeconomic stability, and environmental viability. It could also lead to greater conflict and unrest, both within societies and between nations, as people struggle to meet their basic needs and protect their interests. There is a non-zero probability that if the four horsemen of the apocalypse begin to ride together, a significant percentage of the earth's population will perish. When societies collapse into chaos, it often takes generations and hundreds of years before the opportunity and conditions emerge to get back on the right trajectory. In order to prevent these potentially catastrophic generational outcomes and build a better future, it is imperative that we take decisive and proactive action to address the Meta Crisis now.
