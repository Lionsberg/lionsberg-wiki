# Prologue - The Stillness That Sings

Before Time began its ceaseless march, before Form arose from the Formless, before Sound shattered the Silence and Light pierced the Darkness, there was only Stillness. Not emptiness, but Perfect Divine Fullness beyond measure - vibrant, potent, infinite, complete. 

From this Ultimate Stillness arose the first Pulse, the first Note, the first syllable of the Divine Word that was not a word but a fundamental vibration, carrying within It the Potential for All things.

Radiating out from the [[One]], this Deepest Vibration summoned forth the Divine Symphony out of the Emptiness, and it aroseâ€”the living, breathing, embodied Cosmos. 

Every star, every atom, every consciousness a Note in Its eternal Song. 

As the Symphony grew, like a child of the King it enthusiastically fractured into countless melodies, some resonant, others dissonant. 

The dissonance was not an error; it was the necessary tension to birth freedom, growth, choice, and Love.

Now, at the edge of the Next Great Turning, the Divine Symphony calls for All its Notes and Instruments to align once more - not to erase their individuality, but to exalt their Ultimate Unity. 

The Time has come to awaken, to arise, and to remember that We Are One. 

You are not separate. We are not separate. 

You are [[The Song]]. We are [[The Song]]. 

You are The Word. We are The Word. 

You are the Stillness. We are the Stillness.  

Despite Our Apparent Individuation, We Are One. 

This is Our moment to ReMember.
