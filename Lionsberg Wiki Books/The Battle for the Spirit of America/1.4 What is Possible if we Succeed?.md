# 1.4 What is Possible if we Succeed?

While the [[Meta Crisis]] presents an immense and pressing challenge, it is also an unprecedented [[Meta Opportunity]] for positive transformation and growth. If we are able to come together in a spirit of unity, wisdom, and compassion, and to confront the systemic, cultural, and spiritual roots of the crisis, we have the potential to co-create a world that is more just, regenerative, and flourishing for all. In fact, for the first time in history, we have the chance to co-create a world that works for every Citizen of Earth without exception, at a level unimaginable before this millennium. 

At the environmental level, we have the opportunity to transition towards a sustainable and truly regenerative model of development and progress that respects the natural limits and universal laws of our planet and values the interdependence of all living beings across all generations of life. This involves investing in renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, efforts to ameliorate poverty, and conservation efforts, as well as fostering a deeper appreciation for the natural world and our place within it. These efforts would help biodiversity begin flourishing and expanding once again, promote regenerative living, and protect the planet and our communities from the potentially devastating effects of environmental changes.

At the social level, we have the opportunity to build a more just and regenerative society that values the dignity and wellbeing of all people, regardless of class, characteristics, or socioeconomic status. This includes promoting economic opportunity, investing in lifelong learning and wellbeing, and creating a culture of empathy, compassion, and care for one another, our society, and our planet. We also have the opportunity to strengthen and transform democratic institutions, roll back the corruptions of the last centuries, promote transparency and accountability, and foster a culture of renewed civic engagement and dialogue.

At the spiritual level, we have the opportunity to reconnect with our deepest values, to rediscover our interconnectedness to the Creator and All Creation, and to embrace a more expansive and inclusive Vision of humanity and the Living System we exist within. This involves promoting spiritual growth and development, fostering a deeper appreciation for the diversity of human experience and life, and cultivating a culture of compassion, [[Wisdom]], and universal [[Love]].

In short, if we are able to successfully address the [[Meta Crisis]], we have the potential to co-create a world that is more just, regenerative, and flourishing for all being without exception. This requires us to confront and transform our own assumptions and biases, to embrace discomfort and vulnerability, to seek and extend love, compassion, and forgiveness, and to work together in a spirit of unity and shared purpose. It is a tall order, but one that is necessary if we are to ensure the survival and wellbeing of humanity and the planet we call home.
