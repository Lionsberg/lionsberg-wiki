# The MP - Resourcing the Critical Path, and Establishing Mission Control

The [[Critical Path]] objective for Spring 2023 was to gather abundant resources to equip and empower the distributed [[Team of Teams]] that would [[Co-Operate]] the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

The Resources were necessary to establish the [[Mission Control]] center from which [[The Great Battle]] to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]] and forge the [[New World]] would be waged. 

To facilitate this, they discovered that Lionsberg had already established the framework and architecture for two distinct types of resourcing: 1) Core Team and Infrastructure (Core Enterprise), and 2) Impact Funds. 

The [[Lionsberg Core Team and Infrastructure Fund]] was focused on resourcing the [[Core Enterprise]], which in turn connected and empowered the distributed [[Team of Teams]]. 

The distributed [[Team of Teams]] was funded by the [[Lionsberg Impact Fund]], which was structured as a Fund of Funds. 

This funding structure afforded the opportunity to see a distributed network of funds as a single [[Meta Fund]], while also differentiating out intelligence and optionality into component pieces the could be individually strengthened and advanced.
