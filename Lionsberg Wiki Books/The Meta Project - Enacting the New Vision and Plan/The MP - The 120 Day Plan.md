# The MP - The 120 Day Plan

The effort to resource the [[Citizen Led]] joint venture was articulated in a 120 day plan. 

By March 1, 2023 the allies had worked together to articulate: 
- The [[New Vision]]  
- [[The New Analysis]]  
- [[The New Strategy]] 
- [[The New Goals and Objectives]] 
- [[The New Plan]] 
- [[The New Platform]] 
- [[The New System and Approach]] 
- [[The New Structure]] 

They then presented these to the world through [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], [[The Meta Project - Enacting the New Vision and Plan]], [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]], [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]], [[An Alternative to Apocalypse - The New Covenant]], [[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]] and other publications. 


The [[New Vision and Plan]] resonated, and enough support was generated to advance. Although short of what was ideal, the resources generated provided the critical runway necessary to reorient the [[Team of Teams]], establish [[Mission Control]] and a center of gravity, and advance. 

Thus, out of its many elements, the United Force For Good was forged.
