# The MP - The 120 Day Plan

The effort to resource the [[Citizen Led]] joint venture was articulated in a 120 day plan put forth by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and allies in January 2023. 

This 120 day plan established the imperative and near-term-objective of having well-resourced and coordinated teams in place and co-operating [[Mission Control]] and the [[Lionsberg System]] by May 1, 2023. 

(For posterity sake, this [[Forward Looking Story]] was written in February 2023, prior to any resources being raised beyond the personal resources provided by Jordan to co-create the System, Platform, and Approach). 

By March 1, 2023 the allies had worked together to articulate: 
- [[The New Vision]]  
- [[The New Analysis]]  
- [[The New Strategy]] 
- [[The New Goals and Objectives]] 
- [[The New Plan]] 
- [[The New Platform]] 
- [[The New System and Approach]] 
- [[The New Structure]] 

They then presented these to the world through [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]], [[The Meta Project - Enacting the New Vision and Plan]], [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]], and other publications. 

Through March and April, Jordan and others held a series of highly targeted meetings with allies and potential resourcing and funding sources. 

A [[Subscription Agreement]] process was used to bring the network to consensus while controlling risk. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] resonated, and enough support was generated to advance. Although short of what was ideal, the resources generated provided the critical runway necessary to reorient the [[Team of Teams]], establish [[Mission Control]] and a center of gravity, and advance. 

Thus, out of its many elements, the United Force For Good was forged.

___
Opportunity: If humanity would like to respond and resource the critical path sooner than May 1, 2023, each day saved on Critical Path might result in immeasurable pain and suffering saved, risk mitigated, and opportunity and benefit garnered.
