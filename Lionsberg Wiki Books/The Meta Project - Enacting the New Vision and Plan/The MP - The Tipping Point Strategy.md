# The MP - The Tipping Point Strategy

Because they recognized that they were dealing with a fundamental transformation in the Way of being and behavior of the human species, the [[Force For Good]] recognized that the tip of the spear would need to advance along the [[Critical Path]] of a [[Shift In Consciousness]]. They hypothesized that this [[Shift In Consciousness]] would likely spread throughout the human species in a gradient, similar to basic adoption curves for any new technology. Or, as another metaphor, like a siphon from the [[Old]] to the [[New]], through which each individual that passed through would "pull" the next adjacent individuals through, while expanding the size of the conduit. 

Although it was recognized that [[Consciousness]] was not limited by the perceived laws of nature, the Force For Good calculated a mathematical unfolding along a Fibonacci-like exponential sequence, with a ~62% rate of expansion per cycle, and a cycle time of unknown gestation / duration, predicted to be 3 to 12 weeks, with a mean hypothesis of 6 weeks. 

On this basis, they calculated that every individual on earth could be *invited by someone they knew and loved, at a time when they were ready*, to tell their [[Story]], and consider migrating towards [[New]], within a 7 to 10 year period. 

This mathematical analysis matched their approximate understanding of [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], and demonstrated that the [[New Vision and Plan]] *might actually work*, if each milestone and phase could be advanced through properly. 

### Phase 0: Zero to One to a Few 

Phase zero represented the movement FROM individuals in isolation, TO a few together forging a Center of Gravity for the [[New]]. 

### Phase I: A Few to 100 Million 

Phase one represented the expansion from a few to the first hundred million. 

100 Million represented approximately the first 1.25% of the population

### Phase II: 100 Million to 400 Million 

Phase two represented the expansion from 100 million to 400 million. 

400 Million represented approximately the first 5% of the population, pulled into the [[New]] by the first 1%. 

### Phase III: 400 Million to 3 Billion 

Phase three represented the expansion from 400 million to 3 billion. 

3 Billion represented approximately the first 33% of the population (assuming Armageddon forestalled), pulled into the New by the first 5%. 

### Phase IV: 3 Billion to 8.X Billion 

Phase four represented the expansion from 3 billion to 8 billion. 

8 Billion represented the first ~95% of the population, pulled into the New by the 84%, which was pulled by the 67%, which was pulled by the 33%. 

### Phase V: 8.X Billion to X Billion 

Phase V represented the last phase of the 7 to 10 year transition period. 

This last period represented the last 5%, 3%, then 1% of holdouts, including those viciously opposed to the [[New Vision and Plan]].
