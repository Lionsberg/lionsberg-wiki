# The MP - The Reciprocating Top Down and Bottom Up Funding Strategies

As in nearly all such "either-or" cases, it was discovered that the "either or" of top-down or bottom-up funding was a false dichotomy. 

The joint venture therefore determined that it would pursue two strategies simultaneously. 

The first would reach out to high net worth individuals, foundations, and other granting organizations to secure the secure $XX Millions of dollars required. Metaphorically, this capital would serve as the small starting engine to move the spaceship down the runway. 

The second would reach out to everyday Citizens around the world, and encourage them to meaningfully contribute whatever they could out of their available flow of resources. Metaphorically, this capital, coming from (eventually) millions or billions of people, $1, $7, or $100 at a time, would result in hundreds of millions of billions of dollars of available resources *each month*. 

Because the Lionsberg Structure was established as a series of legal commons that *no one owned*, all such resources would be transparently stewarded and allocated to advance the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]], for the benefit of [[All]].
