# The MP - A Backbone and a Mind

The early seers saw that each of these heroes and solutions were like body parts that lay scattered around the world.  

As the seers watched, they saw that the body parts had been prepared and were indeed destined to rise up into some kind of [[New]] [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. 

They recognized that if indeed the Citizens of Earth were destined to become one body, one united Force For Good, they would need a backbone to connect up and empower each of the unique parts, and a mind to enable them to perceive, think, and move together to [[Meet The Needs]], [[Solve The Problems]], and [[Accomplish The Goals]] that stood in their [[Way]].
