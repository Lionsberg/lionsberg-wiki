# 23. The Corrupt, Fraudulent and Deceitful Existing Order

The entire [[Existing Order]] is corrupt, fraudulent, deceitful, and is about to [[Collapse]]. 

A house divided against itself cannot stand, and therefore it is falling. 

For the last couple years, I have been arguing that 2024 is likely to be the last quasi-democratic election in US history. If we do not sort this out NOW, the American Experiment we thought we were living in is over. 

Because of the degree of abject and permeating corruption and deceit in the [[Invisible Power Structures]] puppeting the [[Visible Power Structures]], only a radical 
response at the constitutional level has any chance of succeeding in curing the cancer that is destroying the United States, the European Union, Western Civilization, and therefore the world. 

As reiterated in [[Above The Chaos, Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto|Jordan's January 2024 Manifesto]], I believe this requires 70% of Americans getting behind a constitutional amendment to fundamentally reset the American Experiment, shrink the federal government by at least 80%, decentralize and redistribute power and authority back to states and localities, and make the US among the first nations to enact and embody the New Covenant.

I cannot repeat this enough... the existing Order is failing, and no family on Earth is safe. 

## Supply Lines, and the Game of Empire and Oligarchy

[[The Game of Empire and Oligarchy]] throughout history has required gaining and controlling [[Power Over]] the world's [[Supply Lines]] and all other subpowerful organizations. 

The Trojan War is a story that demonstrates the shift of Supply Line Supremacy from land-based to seas-based. 

After 1,800 years of artificially imposed darkness on the human species, the 15th century rediscovery of the cipher and the European adoption of Arabic numerals make possible the navigational and celestial computations of Columbus and Copernicus. 

By the 16th century, the capabilities of ships, ship, building, and circumnavigation were sufficiently advanced to rediscover the spherical and predominantly water-covered nature of the Earth, and enable the age of imperial conquest to enter an entirely new phase. 

## Limited Liability Companies 

In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I and surrounding elites established the East India Company. 

Exercising the powers of the Crown, she granted the enterprise backers limited liability for any losses or damages the company might incur. 

This enabled the Royalty, Owners, and Financiers to limit their losses and liability from afar, while the sailors, employees, and slaves on the front lines could not. 

"Ltd" (limited), "Inc" (incorporated), and other capitalist legal definitions stem from this. 

It is important to note that this is not an "real" legal construct, and perhaps it is even an inherently immoral one. At least according to the Jesuits. 

It is, rather, like so many aspects of society, a royal-decreed, social-custom-accepted, and then legal-judgment-upheld inclusion in our social construct, which dramatically favors the tiny ruling financial elite over the vast working class that bears the burden of the requisite sweat, loss, blood, and tears associated with human endeavor. 

## Fascist Military-Corporate-Industrial Power, and Supply Lines 

While historians place prime emphasis on the Roman legions as establishing the power of the Roman Empire, it was in fact the development of ships and the overseas line of vital supply upon which the power of the legions was built. The Roman superpower was in transporting those legions and keeping them supplied across the Empire. 

Having learned their lessons, the [[Invisible Power Structures]], having shifted their centers of power from Rome into Germany / Austria / Hungary and then London, knew the basic battle plan. 

The East India Company, with its backers shielded from loss, of course would not have to undertake their planetary exploitation without fascist state assistance. 

Elizabeth and the [[Invisible Power Structures]] planned to unite [[The Power and Instrumentalities of the State]] in service of the special interests of her and the wealthy elite, by having her army and navies first gain control of the world's seas. 

This was the largest to date of such [[National Power Structure]] bids to establish and maintain world-trade supremacy through absolute dominance of the world's [[Supply Lines]]. 

From here, the pattern was set: 

The [[Central Animating Spirit]] driving the [[Invisible Power Structures]] would impel them to establish [[Visible Power Structures]] that they could influence (or puppet) to exercise [[The Power and Instrumentalities of the State]] in service of the [[Short Term Profit Seeking]] motive of their limited-liability [[Corporations]]. 

This enabled them to saddle the poor and working class with taxes, losses, and debt as the backbone of the ventures, while themselves reaping the profits of their exploitation, while being shielded from loss. 

With the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the English Empire established dominance over the seas and [[Supply Lines]], established the first closed-loop world system, and became the first Empire "upon which the sun never sets". 

While every previous Empire had been an infinite / open system (only covering part of the sphere of Earth), the British Empire closed the loop and became a spherically closed, finite system. 

## 113 Years of Supply Line Dominance 

For 113 years thereafter, until the end of WWI in 1918, the British Empire designed, built, operated, and maintained the world's most powerful navy, and along with it, near total dominance over the oceans and seas. 

At the end of World War I, its dominions signed treaties and joined the emergent League of Nations as independent states. 

The League of Nations was the first planetary intergovernmental organization, operating until its components were incorporated into the United Nations, and the current [[American Order]] took shape. 

## World Inventory, Perceived Scarcity, and Us vs. Them 

As England set out to establish its fascist dominance of the world's [[Supply Lines]] and resources, the East India Company also undertook responsibility for educating a civilian army of optimally-informed-and-empire-backed scientists, economists, and managerial personnel. 

In 1800, after 200 years of planet-wide effort, Thomas Malthus became the first person in modern history to receive a reasonably complete inventory of the world's vital and economic statistics as best they were understood. 

In 1810, Malthus concluded that that humanity was increasing in numbers geometrically, while life support was increasing only arithmetically, and that therefore the majority of humanity would have to exist in misery and want. 

Darwin then placed into humanity's mind that only the fittest individuals within the fittest species survive. 

Karl Marx then pitted the workers against the elite, setting into existence the Capitalist / Communist struggle that apparently dominated human affairs in the 1900s. 

To this day, much of the science of economics is focused on the allocation of a perceived fundamental scarcity of [[Life Support]] for the generation of short term profits, instead of the long term co-creation of limitless [[Abundance]] and [[Real Wealth]]. 

As opposed to [[Co-Creating Abundance]], this paradigm has led to trillions of dollars of military expenditures by fascist [[Invisible Power Structures]] seeking to develop the ability to kill "ever-more people, at ever-greater distance, in ever-shorter time."

It leads the fascist power structures to construct insatiable and all-consuming [[Centers of Accumulation]] that rob, steal, and exploit resources and [[Life Support]] from the poorest and most vulnerable citizens of [[Worksite Earth]]. 

## The Theft of Our Collective Inheritance 

The purpose of these corporate and political [[Centers of Accumulation]] is to progressively strip-mine our [[Collective Inheritance]] out of the Earth and our local communities, and progressively consolidate it in the hands of [[The Giants]] the puppet without liability, despite the tens of millions of people suffering and dying at their hands each years. 

As of 2024, the vast majority of humanity is asleep as [[Employee Consumer Slaves]], unwittingly captive in the Darkness of [[The Game of Empire and Oligarchy]], and separated from their abundant portion of our [[Collective Inheritance]]. 

## Divide and Conquer

The main tenant of [[The Game of Empire and Oligarchy]] is to [[Divide and Conquer]], and to [[Keep Divided To Keep Conquered]]. 

One of the main ways that it does this is by concealing the "top secret" general knowledge and adaptability within the [[Invisible Power Structures]], while consciously and forcibly over-specializing people, who they keep separate from the other specialists. 

This ensures that only the most elite and corrupted by the system have a complete view of what is actually going on and its implications. 

## The Vicious, and Hopeful, Pareto Principle 

So how did so many come to be mired in debt and poverty, and a few become so wealthy? 

The problem of [[Socioeconomic Inequality]] is far more difficult to deal with than it appears on the surface. 

For a variety of reasons, something like the [[Pareto Principle]] tends to guide the distribution of productive capacity in many social, living, and technological systems. 

The principle is so named because of an Italian Mr. Pareto who noticed that 20% of his pea plants were producing 80% of his peas. This is also sometimes called the 80/20 rule. 

Likewise in many companies, 80% to 90% of the results in an array of areas are accomplished by 10% to 20% of the people, 80% to 90% of pollution caused by 10% to 20% of the polluters, 80% to 90% of the crime is caused by 10% to 20% of the criminals, etc. 

In some systems, it is more like 95/5 than 80/20. 

Over time, there also tends to be a small percentage of the population capable of outsized entrepreneurial productivity and value creation.  

This means that Socioeconomic Justice can only be established through Systems, Culture, and Norms that recognize these realities, and draw up all participants into a fair and just game that recognizes these realities. 

Without a fundamental understanding of reciprocity, generosity, diversity, hospitality, [[Centers of Distribution]], etc. built into the Culture and Norms, the strongest and most capable 10% can simply progressively sweep up the resources for them selves, and use them to subjugate the weak and the poor. 

It is a runaway / exponential cycle, since "it takes money to make money", and the cycles of learning and accumulation move more and more rapidly for those who already have, putting those who do not at an ever-growing disadvantage. 

With conscious mediation of this dynamic, this naturally leads to an essentially feudalistic society. 

A New and more just socioeconomic system therefore must be redesigned, rebuilt, and individually and locally embodied from the ground up if we are to escape from the trap of Employee Consumer Slavery to Fascist Power Structures. 

## The Story of Money

Just like [[The Story of Corporations]] was made up by the ruling elite, so too was [[The Story of Money]]. 

Up until 1500 B.C. the vast majority of “money” was living things of Value: cattle, lambs, goats, pigs, or crops - living things of real Value - [[Life Support]] wealth that reproduced, and could be consumed. 

Around 1,500 B.C., the Phoenicians invented metal money, which they first formed into iron half-rings that looked like a pair of bull's horns, as an icon pointing to the [[Real Wealth]] in the form of cattle they formerly carried. 

This changeover in "money" occurred around the same time as, and helped give rise to, the changeover in "power" from city-state dominance of local affairs, to line-of-supply dominance of local+remote affairs. 

Fastforward ~3,500 years. 

Since about 1873, America is effectively on a gold standard. 

After WWII, at Breton Woods,  the victorious [[Fascist Security State]] and its [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] backers, convinced the allies that instead of gold being used as the primary means of exchange between countries, the US Dollar would be used. 

The countries agreed to fix their currencies to the US Dollar, and the US Dollar to Gold - at $35 / Ounce. 

This created a system where all currencies were essentially backed by gold. 

Under Lyndon Johnson and then Nixon, the US was accelerating spending, for guns and butter, Vietnam, Cold War, UFO research, and the manned mission to the moon. 

The countries pegging their currency to the dollar rightfully became nervous that the United States was printing more currency than it had gold to back it, and began to exchange their $ for gold as agreed to at Breton Woods. 

After secretly meeting with advisors, Nixon calls for the "temporary" suspension of the gold convertibility system. 

On August 15, 1971, the last fixed link to reality and restraint on the [[Fascist Security State]] was broken, just as, for the first time in history, US Citizens had funded the creation of enough of enough knowledge and technology for All of humanity to make it - abundantly. 

Since 1971, America has never run a surplus, and as of 2024, the debt *stands* at $34 Trillion and skyrocketing. 

With this act, Nixon created a system were all currencies are backed by nothing but government promises, government force, and false confidence. 

No nation now uses [[Money]]. We all use fake [[Currency]]. 

In the current [[Debt Denominated Currency]] system, all currency is borrowed into existence. 

It is a classic ponzi scheme. 

The more money "they" loan "us", the more money "they" have to loan "us" in the future, and if they ever stop, the ponzi scheme collapses and we can't pay them back. 

Each time currency is borrowed and printed into existence, it increases the supply of money, and therefore decreases the value of all the existing dollars that were already out there. 

This is what we call [[Inflation]], which is a massive hidden tax on the poor and working class. It is created by [[The Giants]] intentionally. 

It could / should likely be called fraud or theft. 

When currencies are not tied to reality, each nation can do what it wants. For instance countries can arbitrarily debase their currencies, making their industries more competitive, and causing the entire domestic manufacturing base of one nation to move overseas to another. 

As people's money becomes Worth Less, they are forced to borrow to maintain their standards of living... 

This creates a vicious cycle in which governments have to keep inflating the currency supply, or the system will die. 

In 2008, the [[Invisible Power Structures]] that control the government bailed out [[The Giants]] and the [[Invisible Power Structures]] that own them, taking on the toxic debt on behalf of citizens, while protecting the shareholders - another act of fraud. 

By buying their way out of the crisis with fake printed money, it diluted / postponed the crisis, but only by pushing the inevitable [[Collapse]] of a fraudulent system down the road and making the eventual [[Collapse]] worse. 

This system and the acts of the [[Invisible Power Structures]] who created amounts to the greatest fraud and ponzi scheme in history, and every family on Earth has been swept up into it. 

It is not the US Citizens who are guilty of this tortious fraud, even though it was committed in the name of the United States. 

It is the [[Invisible Power Structures]], which collusively co-operate supranationally.

[[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]] has more info on this. 

## Enlightenment Falls, Empire Rises 

Somewhere around 2,500 years ago, there was a shift, and and things veered off course. 

It seems clear that between 200 B.C. and 200 A.D. a deliberately planned policy was adopted by the combined supreme political and religious power structure of that period, which undertook the conditioning of the human reflexes to misconceive and mis-see (or mostly not see at all) the macro-micro-cosmic systems in which we live. 

Their success largely drew the curtains on science  for 1700 years—until 1500 A.D.

## Pirates and "Balance of Trade" Accounting 

- The international trading along the world’s [[Supply Lines]] became the most profitable of all enterprises, and great land-“owners” with clear-cut king’s “deeds” to their land went often to international gold moneylenders. 
- The great land barons underwrote the building of enterprisers’ ships with their cattle or other [[Real Wealth]], the regenerative products of their lands, turned over to the lender as [[Collateral]]. 
- The idea of “earned interest” arose from this holding of livestock by the lender during the voyage. 
- The German word for the calves had by the livestock is “kind”. 
- The lender only returned to the borrower the number of live stock heads (capital) that had been held as collateral. 
- The cattle that were born while the collateral was held by the banker were to belong to the banker. In other words, the interest was payable “in kind”. 
- When the Phoenicians shifted their trading strategy from carrying cattle to carrying metal money, the metal money didn’t have little money—“kind”—but the idea of  earned interest persisted. This meant that the interest was deducted from the original money value, and this of course depreciated the capital equity of the borrower.  Thus, metallic equity banking became a different kind of game from the original concept. 
- Since the metal or paper money does not produce children—”kind”—the banker’s so-called earned share must, in reality, be deducted from the depositor’s true-wealth deposit. 
- The merchant bankers of Venice came to underwrite the Venetians’ (the Phoenicians’) voyaging ventures.
- It was the financing of such international voyaging, trading, and individual travel as well as of vaster games of governmental takeovers that built the enormous wealth-controlling fortunes of ***early European private banking families***.
- This gradual alteration of world trading devices from cattle to gold brought about the world-around development of pirates, for whom it was now far easier to steal, hide, and distribute the vast value of metal coins they could steal, than the livestock of former times. 
- It was in 1805, 200 years after the founding of the East India Company, that the British won the Battle of Trafalgar, giving them dominance of all the world’s [[Supply Lines]].
- In order to get  their gold off the sea and out of reach of the pirates, the British made deals with the sovereigns of all the countries around the world with whom they traded, by which it was agreed from then on to keep annual accounts of their intertrading and at the end of the year to move the gold from the debtor’s bank in London to the creditor’s bank in  London to balance the accounts. In this way they kept the gold off the ocean and immune to sea pirate raiding. This  brought about what is now called the [[Balance Of Trade]] accounting. 

## The Great Financiers, Invisible Power Structures, and the Theft of Our Land   

- It was under analogous circumstances of financing inter-American European trade that, in the late nineteenth century, [[J.P. Morgan]] gained great power, along with [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] and its predecessors. 
- By having banking houses in London, Europe, and the United States, they were able not only to  finance people’s foreign travel, all their intershipment of  goods, and to give letters of credit, but also to finance and control major railroading, shipbuilding, mining, manufacturing, and energy-generating enterprises in general. 

## 1776 - The Invisible Power Structures Behind Britain Did Not Lose the War 

- In our tracing of ***the now completely invisible world power structures*** it is important to note that, while the British Empire as dominant world government lost the American Revolution, ***the Invisible Power Structure behind it did not lose the war***. 
- The most visible of the power-structure identities was the East India Company, an entirely private enterprise whose flag as adopted by Queen Elizabeth in 1600 happened to have ***thirteen red and white horizontal stripes with a blue rectangle in its upper lefthand corner***.
- While the British government lost the 1776 war, ***the East India Company’s owners and most-wealthy-families who constituted the invisible power structure behind the  British government*** not only did not lose but moved right into the new U.S.A. economy ***along with the latter’s most powerful landowners***. 

## 1776 - The Land of the Founders, and False Blessing in the Name of God 

- The supreme leaders of the American Revolution were of the southern type—George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Both were great landowners with ***direct royal grants for their lands***. 
- Obviously, very powerful people had their land given to  them by the king and not by God, but ***the king, with the church’s approbation, asserted it was with God’s blessing***. 
- The church’s approbation of this land theft was largely built through a series of [[15th Century Papal Bulls]], which provided backing and religious blessing for the Spanish, Portuguese, and eventually English empires to colonize, subjugate, and enslave indigenous people. 
- The indigenous people had a different idea of God’s blessing, and did not consider being categorized as barbarians and having the Creator's land they were stewarding stolen as part of it. 
- This royal-deed-processing produced a vast number of court decisions and legal precedent based on centuries and centuries of deed inheritances. 
- In the United States, the legal framework that evolved from these early justifications of land conquest and ownership was the [[Doctrine of Discovery]]. 
- This doctrine, rooted in the European legal tradition that traced back to Rome and Catholic Church, was directly applied in U.S. law and property rights. 
- It held that sovereign power over land passed to the [[Invisible Power Structures]]-Backed nation that “discovered” it, to the exclusion of indigenous sovereignty.
- One of the most significant U.S. Supreme Court cases that invoked the Doctrine of Discovery was Johnson v. McIntosh (1823). In this landmark decision, written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Court declared that private citizens could not purchase lands directly from Native Americans. 
- The legal rationale was that the “discovery” by European nations granted them sovereignty over the lands in question.
- Thus, landlord’s deeds, the word we still use to this day, evolved from deeds originally dispensed by Kings in recognition of deeds of war, distributed to their notable and loyal lords, such as some of the slave-owning founders of the United States.  
- Because of ancient arms-accomplished seizure of land by the most physically powerful... and the subsequent arms-induced blessing of the seizures by "ministers of God" backed by the power and weapons of the [[Fascist Security State]]s... 
- ...the royal deeds to land were written as assumedly God-approved and guaranteed covenants, and the basis of our modern legal system. 
- "Landlordism" has become an accepted phenomenon as seemingly inevitable as the weather, as the rich get richer and the serf / peasant / [[Employee Consumer Slaves]] pay the rent. 
- ***“Land “ownership” and its omni-dependent comprehensive thing-ownership involvements and their legal-documents-perpetuations constitute the largest socioeconomic custom error presently being maintained by a large world affairs-affecting segment of humanity.”***
- ***“What is new is that humanity has gone as far as it can go with this significant error and is in final examination as to whether it can free itself from its misconditioned reflex straightjacket in time to pull out of its greatest-in-all-history, error-occasioned tailspinning into eternity. We do have both the knowledge and the technical means to do so if we do it quickly enough.”***
- In non-coincidental timing laying another piece of groundwork for the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], on March 30, 2023, the Vatican formally repudiated the [[Doctrine Of Discovery]] upon which North Americans came to dispossess the Native American stewards of God’s land. 
- While the Vatican had no jurisdiction over [[Turtle Island]] then, or now, the only apparent source of authority justifying the American confiscation of [[Turtle Island]] from the Indigenous tribes has now been invalidated, which in consequence invalidates the Supreme Court decisions based upon it. 
- The Vatican said in the statement: “The Catholic Church therefore repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political [[Doctrine Of Discovery]].”
- As of 2024, the Citizens of the [[Fascist Security State]]s now have to grapple with what it means to have the principle upon which their land rights are based formally invalidated, in recognition of its original Spiritual and Moral invalidity. 
- Similar spiritual, philosophical, and legal issues will have to be resolved in every country touched by the successors to the Not-So-Holy-Roman-Empire and the Catholic-Church it made in its own image to enable the Invisible Power Structure Backed co-option of the story of Jesus.

#### Metals and Mining 

- In 1810, only five years after Malthus’s pronouncement of the fundamental inadequacy of life support on planet Earth, the telegraph was invented. 
- It used copper wires to carry its messages. This was the beginning of a new age of advancing information and technology.
- All the new technology of all the advancing industry, which was inaugurated by the production of steel in the midnineteenth century, required the use of all the known primary metallic elements in various intercomplementary alloyings.
- The metals were rarely found under the farmlands or in the lands that belonged to the old lords of the foodproductive lands. 
- Metals were found—often, but not always, in mountains—all around the world, in lands of countries remote from one another. Mine ownerships were often granted by imperial governments to the first to file claims, in violation of the stewardship of the indigenous communities that had been tending the lands for millennia. 
- It was the high-seas, intercontinental, international trafficking in these [[Metals]] that made possible an array of industries. 
- The high-seas trafficking of [[Metals]] was mastered by the world-around line-of supply controllers—the venturers and pirates known collectively as the British Empire. 

## The International Bankers 

- This world-around traffic was in turn financed, accounted, and maximally profited in by the ***international bankers*** and their letters of credit, bills of  exchange, and similar pieces of paper. 
- International banking greatly reduced the necessity for businessmen to travel with their exported goods to collect at the importer’s end. 
- Because the world-around-occurring metals were at the heart of this advance in standards of living for increasing numbers of humans all around the world, the struggle for mastery of this trade by the invisible, behind-the-scenes-contending world power structures rose as the world sailed towards [[World War I]]. 

## 1870s - Robber Barons and the Rise of Corporate / Fascist Power in America and Europe

After the Civil War in America...

...in 1872, things begin to shift. 

The Corporation is brought into a new era under influence from [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] and the most powerful US and international families, which entirely insulates the humans puppetting the national and supranational corporations from any personal liability associated with corporate activities. 

[[Brown Brothers Harriman]] plays a crucial role in enshrining [[Corporate Personhood]] in the United States, immunizing the human beings who pilot the soulless corporations, while mandating that the corporations operate like zombies / soulless giants to maximize short term profits and shareholder value. 

The [[Doctrine of Ultra Vires]], originally established in the United Kingdom in 1612, is imported. 

This helps usher in the "gilded age" of the [[Robber Barons]] and their families. 

Note that the Jesuits designate this a sinful structure, because it is drives corporations on the basis of short term greed, self-interest, avarice, and accumulation, while preventing them from considering the [[Greatest Good]]. 

Note that since 1873, America is effectively on a gold standard. 


## 1898 - President McKinley, Mark Hanna, and Money 

The rise of the [[Robber Barons]] gives rise to President McKinley, and his advisor Mark Hanna, in 1890s and McKinley's election in 1898. 

A key issue in the election is the issue of [[Currency]]. 

A tenant of Mark Hanna's worldview, reflected in quotes, is that the greatest ambition any human could have is to make as much money as possible before he dies. 

## American Corporate Imperialism 

The veins of the American Imperialism present in the theft of the East Coast lands from the indigenous nations, the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]], and the Westward March across North America, continued to expand. 

The key figure in that expansion was [[John W. Foster]], who became United States Secretary of State in 1892. 

In conspiracy with Brown Brothers Harriman, the wealthiest families, and the other imperial powers...
- Hawaiian Islands are overthrown
- Guam overthrown 
- Marshall Islands  
- The so called [Unequal Treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaties) are forced with China, which China views as unfairly imposed in violation of its sovereignty, reducing China to semicolonial status. 

Operating out of [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], orchestrating Treaty of Versailles under Robert Lancing. 

Allend Dulles becomes legal council for [[Brown Brothers Harriman]]. 

Families conspiring to take over the US Government, and to put the instrumentalities of the American Government at the behest of the interest of their private corporations. 

## 1893 - US Government Overthrows Hawaiian Government  

In 1893 Queen [Liliʻuokalani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili%CA%BBuokalani "Liliʻuokalani") was illegally deposed and placed under [house arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest "House arrest") by businessmen (who included members of the Dole family) with help from the United States Military. 

The [Republic of Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Hawaii "Republic of Hawaii") governed for a short time until Hawaii was annexed by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") in 1898 as the [Territory of Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_Hawaii "Territory of Hawaii"). In 1959, the islands became the [50th American state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii").

## 1898 - US Government Occupies Guam 

The United States [occupied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Guam "Capture of Guam") the island following Spain's defeat in the 1898 [Spanish–American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War "Spanish–American War"), as part of the [Treaty of Paris of 1898](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1898) "Treaty of Paris (1898)"). Guam was transferred to the [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") control on December 23, 1898, by [Executive Order 108-A](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_108-A "s:Executive Order 108-A") from 25th President [William McKinley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley "William McKinley").
## 1903 - US Overthrows Government of Nicaragua on Behalf of United Fruit 

1903 - US Military Expeditionary Force sent to Nicaragua to overthrow the government on behalf of United Fruit...
- Who was a client of Sullivan and Cromwell...
- ...which was the law firm that [[John W. Foster]]'s grandson's [[Allen Dulles]] and [[John Foster Dulles]] were partners in, as council to [[Brown Brothers Harriman]].   
## World War I 

- In 1914, the first of a series of world wars breaks out, through which humanity will weaponize the advanced technology it is developing against itself, and send its children to kill over 100 Million of its children in a single century. 
- As war eventually broke out, by skillful psychology and propaganda the [[Invisible Power Structures]] persuaded America that they were fighting “to save democracy.”
- For the first time in history, from 1914 to 1918, humanity entered upon a comprehensive program of industrial transformation and went from wire to wireless communications; from tracked to trackless transportation; from two-dimensional transport to four-dimensional; from visible structuring and mechanical techniques to invisible—atomic and molecular—structuring  and mechanics. 
- Global logistics and [[Supply Lines]] are significantly advanced. 

## 1918 - American Expeditionary Forces to Russia to Try to Crush the Bolshevik Revolution

In 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces are ordered by [[Robert Lansing]] to enter Russia to attempt to crush the Bolshevik revolution. US Military operation on Russian soil.  
## 1818 - 1919 Treaty of Versailles 

[[Robert Lansing]] ends up supervising the Treaty of Versailles in 1918. He assigns [[Allen Dulles]] and [[John Foster Dulles]], his nephews, grandsons of [[John W. Foster]], as staff to the Treaty of Versailles negotiations. 

They draft reparations demands into the Treaty. 

They turn around and negotiate with the people behind [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] to give Germany loans to pay the reparations. 

The reparations go to the Corporations who had lost property in the war. 

## Financing the Rebuilding of the German War Machine, and the Rise of the Third Reich

In exchange for the loans, [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] families take stock in the German War Industry, and end up financing the rebuilding of the military machine in Germany. 

Simultaneously, they are funding the rise of the Third Reich and the construction of the Third Reich International Headquarters through Union Bank of New York, and the subsidiary in the Netherlands. 

Their plan is to fund the rise of the Third Reich to control Germany, raise Germany back up to power after World War I, and then to have Germany stand astride Europe as a bulwark against Bolshevism in Europe, while they move Westward out into the Pacific to assert increasing dominance over Hawaii, Guam, Marshall Islands, etc. (overthrown under [[John W. Foster]]) on their way to developing the entire Asian market. 

Group called the China Lobby at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]]. 

## Taxes

While “death and taxes” seem eternal, in Reality there were little to no federal income taxes until after World War I, when the publicly-espoused Founding Principles of the United States began to be abandoned at an accelerating rate, and the the American Imperial World Order continued its rise in service of the [[Invisible Power Structures]]. 

## 1915 - 1920 - Robert Lansing Secretary of State Under Wilson 

Between 1915 and 1920, [[Robert Lansing]], married to daughter of [[John W. Foster]], is Secretary of State under Wilson, before being asked to resign. 
## 1920 - George Herbert Walker and Harriman's 

Early CEO of [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] pre-structure was [[George Herbert Walker]], maternal grandfather of George H.W. Bush, great grandfather of George W. Bush. 

In 1920, [[George Herbert Walker]] becomes the President of the [W.A. Harriman & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.A._Harriman_%26_Co. "W.A. Harriman & Co."). Took control of Hamburg-Amerika, one of world's largest shipping companies. [W.A. Harriman & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.A._Harriman_%26_Co. "W.A. Harriman & Co.") (renamed [Harriman Brothers & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriman_Brothers_%26_Company "Harriman Brothers & Company")in 1927) had extensive German and Russian businesses. 
## 1924 - Prescott Bush Sets Up United Banking Corporation

1924 - [[Prescott Bush]] (father and grandfather of two U.S. Presidents) sets up United Banking Corporation in New York, capitalized by the Brown Brothers Harriman partners / families. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Banking_Corporation)

## Bank of Shipping and Commerce, and Nazi Financing 

They then found or establish relations with entity in Netherlands called Bank of Shipping and Commerce (apparently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_voor_Handel_en_Scheepvaart), associated with the financing activities of Nazi party member [[Fritz Thyssen]]. 

This enables the financing of the International Headquarters of the Third Reich, and Hitler's rise to power. 
## 1927 - Prescott Bush joins Harriman's Bank

1927 [[Prescott Bush]] joins Harriman's Bank. 
## 1930 - Brown Brothers and Harriman's Merge

January 1, 1931 Harriman's and British-American investment house [Brown Bros. & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bros._%26_Co. "Brown Bros. & Co.") merge, with the London branch continuing operations as [Brown, Shipley & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown,_Shipley_%26_Co. "Brown, Shipley & Co.").

[[Brown Brothers Harriman]] becomes the key. It's origin story involves a group of twenty of the richest families in the country, the robber barons, came together and formed a group called Brown Brothers Harriman in New York City. Carnegies, Rockefellers, Harriman, et al., who sat, made policy together, and pulled the strings of the [[Fascist Security State]]. 


[[Robert Lovett]], a senior partner at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], moves back and forth between financing and the US government, eventually writing the memo to Truman recommending the creation of the [[CIA]]. 

[[Allen Dulles]] was legal council, which was why they appointed him as the first civilian head of the [[CIA]]. 

[[Robert Lovett]] later works with Senator [Arthur Vandenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Vandenberg "Arthur Vandenberg") to draft the [Vandenberg resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_resolution "Vandenberg resolution"), which led to the establishment of [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO").

## 1932 - 1933 - Corporations Running Roughshod - Franklin D. Roosevelt Wins Election.

1933 - [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wins the election and implements the New Deal, dramatically expanding the federal government. Issues executive orders to attempt to reign in investors and corporations. 
## The Banking Act of 1933

The Banking Act of 1933, known as Glass-Steagall, requires the separation of commercial banking and securities underwriting activities. Only [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] and [[J.P. Morgan]] elect to remain commercial banks. 
## 1934 - Roosevelt Court Packing 

In 1934, Roosevelt threatens to expand the Supreme Court -  as he was trying to reign in the corporations and bankers, the Court was consistently upholding [[Corporate Personhood]], and ruling that corporations were entitled to the fundamental rights of persons per the US Constitution. 

A similar issue later emerges under Citizens United. 

## 1934 - Brown Brothers Harriman / Dupont Coup Attempt 

[[Brown Brothers Harriman]], the Duponts, and associated families then engage in planning the military overthrow of Roosevelt in 1934. They Attempt to recruit General Butler to launch a major military coup. 

## 1939 - 1945 - World War II 

In 1939, World War II breaks out, and the lines of battle between the [[Visible Power Structures]] are less clear that their puppetting behind the scenes by the [[Invisible Power Structures]]. 

- **IBM and Dehomag**: IBM, through its German subsidiary Dehomag, provided the technology and expertise for the Nazis to conduct censuses and manage logistical operations, which were used to identify and persecute Jews and other minority groups. The Hollerith machines, a precursor to modern computers, were essential in the organization of concentration camps and the efficient execution of the Holocaust.
- **Ford Motor Company**: Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, had significant business interests in Nazi Germany. The Ford plant in Cologne produced military vehicles and equipment for the German war effort. Despite the US being at war with Germany, Ford continued to maintain these operations and profited from the sales.
- **General Motors**: General Motors, through its German subsidiary Opel, also played a significant role in the German war effort by producing military vehicles and aircraft parts. GM's support extended to the production of engines for the German Luftwaffe, directly aiding the Nazi military machine.
- **Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil)**: Standard Oil engaged in a cartel with IG Farben, a major German chemical company involved in the production of synthetic rubber and fuel, essential for the German war effort. Even after the US entered the war, Standard Oil continued to provide crucial resources to Nazi Germany, including a specialized additive that improved aviation fuel performance.
- **Chase National Bank (now JPMorgan Chase)**: Chase National Bank had substantial financial dealings with Nazi Germany, including the facilitation of transactions and the management of Nazi assets in the United States. Even after the war began, Chase continued to operate accounts for the Nazis and helped them to acquire necessary funds for their war efforts.
- **Union Banking Corporation**: The Union Banking Corporation, associated with Prescott Bush (grandfather of President George W. Bush), was involved in financing the Nazi regime through its dealings with German industrialist Fritz Thyssen, a prominent supporter of Adolf Hitler. The bank's assets were seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act in 1942.
- **DuPont**: DuPont (who previously work with [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] to attempt to overthrow Roosevelt in 1934) had extensive business relationships with German chemical giant IG Farben, which was instrumental in the Nazi war effort and the Holocaust. DuPont's collaboration involved the exchange of multiple patents and technologies. 

And of course, the ongoing race to reverse engineer and adopt alien technologies. 

## Post WWII - The New World Order 

Post WWII, a new world order was implemented by the United States and its allies. 

This brought forth an array of new institutions, and a fundamental transformation to the way governance, power, and authority operated on Earth. 

- **Establishment of the United Nations (UN)**: Founded in 1945, the UN replaced the League of Nations as the primary international organization dedicated to maintaining peace and security, promoting human rights, and fostering social and economic development.
- **Bretton Woods Institutions**: The creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 established a new framework for international economic cooperation. The IMF was designed to ensure monetary stability, while the World Bank aimed to provide financial and technical assistance for reconstruction and development.
- **NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)**: Established in 1949, NATO is a military alliance of Western countries formed to provide collective security against the threat of Soviet expansion. 
- **Decolonization**: The post-war period saw the rapid dismantling of European colonial empires in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Former colonies gained independence, leading to the creation of numerous new sovereign states and significantly altering the global political landscape.
- **Cold War Dynamics**: The ideological and geopolitical struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union defined the post-war era. This bipolar world order led to the formation of military alliances (e.g., NATO and the Warsaw Pact), proxy wars, and a nuclear arms race, profoundly influencing global politics and security.
- **European Integration**: The establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, followed by the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, laid the groundwork for the European Union (EU).
- **Human Rights Movement**: The horrors of World War II and the Holocaust spurred the development of international human rights frameworks. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, set out fundamental rights and freedoms for all individuals and has influenced numerous human rights treaties and national constitutions.
- **Global Trade and Economic Integration**: The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in 1947, and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), transformed trade and economic intergration.
- **Technological and Scientific Advancements**: The post-war period saw rapid advancements in technology and science, driven in part by wartime innovations and the ongoing reverse engineering of alien technologies. Developments in nuclear energy, space exploration, computing, and telecommunications transformed economies and societies, contributing to globalization and the spread of information
- **International Development and Aid**: The establishment of numerous international organizations and programs focused on development and aid, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and various regional development banks, on the surface aimed to address poverty, promote sustainable development, and support economic growth in developing countries.

## Post-World War II Redrawing of Nation-State Lines and Its Consequences

The post-World War II era saw significant redrawing of nation-state boundaries, often driven by geopolitical interests and strategic considerations. Germany was divided into East and West, reflecting Cold War tensions, while India and Pakistan's partition along religious lines led to massive displacement and violence. The creation of Israel resulted in enduring conflict with Palestinians. Eastern Europe saw borders shifted to Soviet advantage, displacing millions. Korea's division into North and South mirrored superpower rivalry, leading to the Korean War. Arbitrary colonial boundaries in Africa and the Middle East sowed seeds of future conflicts. Vietnam's split foreshadowed the Vietnam War, while Italy and Japan lost territories as part of post-war settlements. These boundary changes frequently overlooked ethnic and cultural realities, leading to long-term instability and conflict.

## 1946 - United States Takes Over Marshall Islands, Forcibly Evacuates Residents, and Tests Atomic Weapons 

In 1947, the United States entered into an agreement with the [UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council "UN Security Council") to administer much of [Micronesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronesia "Micronesia"), including the Marshall Islands, as the [Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_Territory_of_the_Pacific_Islands "Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands").

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the [Pacific Proving Grounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Proving_Grounds "Pacific Proving Grounds") for the United States and was the site of 67 [nuclear tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_test "Nuclear test") on various atolls.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands#cite_note-82)

[Operation Crossroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads "Operation Crossroads") atomic bomb testing began in 1946 on [Bikini Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Atoll "Bikini Atoll") after some of the residents were forcibly evacuated.

## 1947 - National Security Act 

Creates the CIA and strengthens the [[Fascist Security State]]. 

The [[Fascist Security State]] appoints [[Allen Dulles]], non-coincidentally council to [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], as the first head. 

## 1948 - Declaration of Human Rights Imposes Limitations on Fascism

The 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights prohibited territorial acquisition by military force. 

This meant that countries could no longer run military occupation governments, and that everything had to be done through some form of a political legitimization process. 

This made the psychological "battle for the hearts and minds" more important than ever. 

The CIA would grow skilled at doing this via puppet politicians groomed as emerging leaders by the State Department, leading to some of the most brutal dictatorships. (reference School of the Americas etc.)

## 1948 - United States Rigs the Italian Election 

In the 1948, the United States rigged the Italian election by working with the mob. 

The United States, driven by concerns over the potential rise of communism in Western Europe, engaged in significant covert activities to influence the outcome. George Kennan, a key architect of U.S. Cold War policy, played a role in these efforts. The CIA, in collaboration with Italian-American mafia figures, at least funneled money, provided campaign materials, and spread anti-communist propaganda to support the Christian Democrats and other anti-communist parties. 

## 1948 - George Kennan - The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare 

12 days after the US rigs the Italian election, George Kennan publishes a memo titled "The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare."

The memo argues that the United States needed to rig the election, and that a department was needed to continue to do this around the world. 

Hastens the creation of the National Security State. 

## 1948 - War Department Renamed to Defense Department 

The [[Fascist Security State]] undertakes a diplomatic onslaught to attempt to make foreign activities look like political rather than military influence and control. 

## The Social Contract / Foreign-Domestic Firewall

The creation of the emergent National Security State was predicated on the creation of foreign / domestic firewall... 

The [[Fascist Security State]] explicitly wanted to create a department to rig foreign elections, control foreign media, mettle in affairs around the world...

...but was explicitly not allowed to operated here in the United States. 

The State Department, Department of Defense, and CIA were expressly forbidden to operate on US soil. 

This ended up being laughably far from the case. 
## 1949 - Secretary of Defense Forrestal Forced to Resign, and Subsequently Assassinated 

After tensions build between Truman and Forrestal, who opposed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and the centralizing of power of the Department of Defense, in 1949 Secretary Forrestal is forced by Truman to resign. 

He is suddenly hospitalized for supposed mental health issues / stress-induced paranoia.  

He is placed on the top floor of the hospital he being treated at, and thrown out of the window during the night, dying on impact. 

The MAJESTIC 12 documents report that military officials called his "untimely death" unfortunate but necessary. 

We have noted that citizens of fascist states who know too much and fall out of favor tend to fall out of windows at an alarming rate. 

President Truman apparently conceals his medical records as part of teh coverup.

## 1940s to 1970s Operation Mockingbird 

Operation Mockingbird was a covert program conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Cold War, starting in the late 1940s. Its primary goal was to influence domestic and foreign media to spread propaganda and manipulate public opinion in favor of U.S. interests. Through this operation, the CIA recruited journalists and editors from major news organizations, providing them with information to publish or guiding the editorial direction of their outlets. The program extended to funding cultural organizations, sponsoring conferences, and using front organizations to shape cultural and intellectual discourse. 

**Gatekeepers of U.S. Media and National Security Influence**

Historically, the relationship between the U.S. media and the national security state has been deeply intertwined. Legacy media organizations, including NBC, ABC, and CBS, were created or significantly influenced by veterans from the Office of War Information (OWI), an entity established during World War II under the War Department. These veterans brought with them a strong orientation towards national security and propaganda, shaping the early broadcast news landscape. From their inception, these major news networks were not entirely independent from the national security state, fostering a century-old relationship that prioritized national interests and security narratives. This legacy underscores the significant influence of government agencies on media operations and content, reflecting a longstanding integration of media with national security objectives.
## 1960 - 1972 - Watergate, The Mob, CIA, and Kennedy Assassinations 

Daniel Sheehan determines that there were [Santo Trafficante Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Trafficante_Jr. "Santo Trafficante Jr.") mafia guys in the Watergate hotel. Why? 

Late May 1960, Presidential campaign is under way. 

Richard Nixon is VP under Eisenhower, campaigning for Republican Nomination. 

May 1960 Nelson Rockefeller withdraws. Nixon convinced he would win against Kennedy. 

As Vice President, Nixon was head of the 5412 Committee - subcommittee of the National Security Council that does covert operations under Section 5412 of the National Security Act of 1947, which authorizes CIA to engage in activities at request from President to protect national security. 

Howard Hughes (yes that one) was living in Las Vegas in the penthouse suite of one of the major mob hotels, and working as a secret consultant to the National Security Council, doing some of the dark special operations of the 5412 Committee.

Nixon calls Hughes and asks him to set up assassination team to kill Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and five others associates, and keep it away from the White House. 

Hughes asks one of his lawyers Robert (Bob) Maheu to get it done. 

Maheu recruits [Johnny Rosselli](https://archive.is/K7Y1X), bag man at the Sands Hotel owned by the mob that Hughes is staying at. 

Fidel Castro had shut down prostitution rings, gambling, and heroin coming into the CIA-front [Sea Supply Corporation](https://archive.is/KL3qE), whose profits the mob is jointly benefitting from. 

Rosselli contacts [Sam Giancana](https://archive.is/WCwkP), his principal in the mob, regarding the CIA plot. 

Giancana tells Rosselli that Cuba is [Santo Trafficante Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Trafficante_Jr. "Santo Trafficante Jr.")'s territory. 

Trafficante wants to make sure the order is direct from Nixon, so additional meeting is set up and attended by Mr. Ed (Sheffield Edwards), chief of security under for the CIA under Eisenhower and Nixon. Maheu, Giancana, Rosselli, and Trafficante meet at Fountain Blue Hotel in Miami. 
Mr. Ed greenlights the assassination team, Trafficante picks 15 shooters, including CIA operatives in Operation 40 (geurilla raids in Cuba).

Included on the team are [Felix Rodriguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Félix_Rodríguez_(soldier)) and Rafael Chichi Cantero, who were running the Contra drug and weapons supply programs (Iran-Contra). 
- Note Felix involvement in assassination of Che Guevara, and ties to George H.W. Bush, including during Iran-Contra. 

The South American assassins were primarily based out of the security division at Pemex in Mexico City, out of the Mexico National Oil Corporation. 
- Operation Condor - assassination teams deployed all over South America run out of Pemex 
- Title 51 assassination teams

[Jose Diaz Serrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Díaz_Serrano), head of Pemex,  is the former business partner with George Bush Sr. in Zapata Oil Corporation. 

CIA Operations In South America 
- Carl Elmer Jenkins - https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/16/if-you-need-dirty-job-done-straight-talk-marine-vet-about-cia-plot-assassinate-castro.html  
- Ranch near Oaxaca Mexico where Felix Rodriguez and other assassins and CIA operatives trained 
- LA Times - The Central Intelligence Agency trained Guatemalan guerrillas in the early 1980s at a ranch near Veracruz, Mexico, owned by drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the murderers of U.S. drug DEA agent Enrique Camarena, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration report made public in Los Angeles.
- CIA also operated a training and logistics hub out of John Hull's ranch in Costa Rica. [Iran Contra and John Hull's Ranch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpEqF_51sw)  
- For example see [Ric Prado](https://spyscape.com/article/from-cuban-orphan-to-cia-legend-the-extraordinary-life-of-ric-prado#:~:text=Central%20America%20spy%20ops&text=The%20CIA%20wanted%20Prado%20to%20train%20the%20Contra%20rebels%20to,fully%20immersed%20in%20the%20mission) training and operations with Contras in Honduras.

[School of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation) - Set up by military and CIA to ensure presence and control of the dictators that America put in place. Training military, intelligence, and insurgents for many years in Panama, Fort Bragg... US training Latin Americans in suppressing internal dissent, overthrowing governments, torture, interrogation, enforcers, controlling politics, economy, media, etc. in violation of US law and basic ethics. 
- A lot of the assassinations, abductions, abuse, etc. being set up and controlled through the United States. 
- Also known as the "School of Dictators"  
- Manuel Noriega and many others who were the most brutal heads of military and intelligence agencies, nearly all graduates of the School of the Americas. 

Daniel Sheehan interviews CIA station chief Joseph Brook Holder Smith, who is brought to meeting by Miguel Nazar Haro, head of DFS in Mexico (Dirección Federal de Seguridad / Federal Security Directorate). Large table, stone fireplace, swastika on the mantle. They inform him that they have spent a lot of time putting together a major cocaine cartel in Columbia, that they are going to be moving the cocaine into the United States, and that a portion of the funds will be used to help finance "our war without boundaries". Want to make sure Smith is on board and understands the deal. 

Kennedy promises he will stand down Operation 40 that was running the attacks under Nixon. 

Nixon lied to Khrushchev - instead they transform Operation 40 into JM Wave, and Operation Mongoose. 

Khrushchev realizes Kennedy has lied, and starts putting missiles in Cuba. 

October 1962... Cuban Missile Crisis.

Kennedy and Khrushchev so traumatized that they had come so close to thermonuclear holocaust / total mutual destruction, they start trading secret letters, discussing disassembly of the entire nuclear arsenal of US and Russia, which was going to be brokered by Pope John the 23rd. 

Kennedy orders Cuban bases shut down. Kennedy apologizes for authorizing attempted invasion at Bay of Pigs. 

After receiving order to shut down bases, Frank Sturgis defies the orders and launches another attack and sinks a Russian ship in the harbor of Havana. Could have made Khrushchev think Kennedy was lying again and resparked the crisis. 

Bobby and John send in US Marshals teams, arrest Frank Sturgis and the guys there. 

Then it happens again - E Howard Hunt starts planning another attack in defiance of orders of the President to shut down bases and cease and desist. Bobby and John send in teams again, arrest them. 

June 5, 1963 - Walter Sullivan reports to Bobby that an assassination team had been set up by Nixon / Hughes / mob / CIA to kill Castro. 

Kennedy orders them to stand down the team. 

Again in defiance of the President's order, June 13 to 19th 1963 the [[Fascist Security State]] puts together a last attempt to go into Cuba and assassinate Castro. Dick Billings from Time magazine / Life Magazine is on the boat with them. 

The same day he had been told of the assassination team (that would end up killing him), June 5, 1963, Kennedy had demanded from the CIA all their UFO information. He was going to provide all of this to Khrushchev as a show of good faith. 

Kennedy offered Khrushchev partnership in a joint space program which including the reverse engineering of the alien technologies. 

Meanwhile elements the [[Fascist Security State]] / [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] were working towards plans for nuclear annihilation of Soviet Union, China, etc., and total domination of the world, and were terrified that Kennedy would use executive powers to begin disarmament before they could complete their plan. 

June 13-15 1963, while on William D. Pawley's boat heading towards assassination attempt, Johnny Martino, Rick Roberston field director for S Force, Carl Jenkins trainer, raging about Kennedy... Pawley says "don't worry... we are going to kill that motherfucker." Dick Billings is witness. 

According to Sheehan the assassination of President Kennedy ends up being ordered by [[Allen Dulles]]. 

The hit team is already assembled and on a boat together, on the way to assassinate Castro. It is arms length from the White House, unless someone rats out Nixon. 

Daniel Sheehan interviewed Trafficante personally, and got first hand information on putting together the assassination team. 

The reason they panicked about the proposed the disarmament was that they knew they needed the nuclear weapons against China. US had a massive advantage against Russia, and Russia was willing to completely disarm. China was also willing to never build nuclear weapons. Just like poison gas at end of WWI, countries agreed that nuclear weapons designed to destroy civilian populations en masse were a complete violation of just war theory. 

Jesuit order agreed to condemn the mere possession of nuclear weapons as a mortal sin, because inherently designed to violate the premises of the just war theory.

November 22, 1963, Kennedy is assassinated and it is the S Force that killed him. 

CIA rolls in and covers up everything, destroys evidence, etc., because they are terrified they would be blamed for killing the President. 

Richard Nixon does the same thing, since he is the one that ordered the assassination team originally to be set up to kill Castro. 

Lyndon Johnson reaches out to Earl Warren Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, asks him to lead investigation but ensure it is not revealed there was an assassination team in the field to kill Castro, so that World War III is not sparked. 

Who do they put on the commission to run it? [[Allen Dulles]], who ordered the assassination.

The S Force was present. According to Sheehan, Roger Morales, the ace shooter for the S Force, was the shooter who pulled the trigger and killed him. 

CIA planned to 
1. Blow up a plane and blame it on Castro  
2. Stage a false flag operation and kill US personnel at Guantanamo, and blame it on Castro  
3. Blow up shopping malls in Miami and blame it on Castro. 

Ties back to Watergate... 

Bernard Leon Barker, Watergate burglar and undercover operative in CIA-directed plots to overthrow Fidel Castro. 

Mark Felt, known as Deep Throat, reveals sequentially numbered bills in Barker's pocket, eventually revealing that Richard Nixon's committee to reelect the president was funding the burglars via the Mexico City Banco International. 

Had they gone a step deeper, it would have led them right back to the assassination team that killed the President. 

## August 1962 - Marilyn Monroe Assassinated 

August 5, 1962 - Marilyn Monroe, who had intimate relationships with both John and Robert Kennedy, killed in the bed she had shared with them.

## Robert Kennedy Assassinated 

Assassinated at hotel by Lockheed security switched onto security team. According to autopsy was shot at point blank range from behind with contact wounds (gun directly on skin or clothes), contrary to story maintained by government and media to this day.

## CIA Chief Indicted For Helms For Claiming Phoenix Program has "only" killed 20,000 People

Helms, CIA chief, indicted for lying to Congress by saying that the Phoenix Program killed 20,000 people, when in fact vastly more were killed. Helms commits perjury and ends up getting fired.

The program was run by Theodore Shackley, CIA station chief in Saigon.  

MKUltra documents also destroyed under helms, just like they ordered Abu Ghraib videos destroyed after Congress ordered them to be turned over. 

Drug money being used to finance the Phoenix Program and limitless war. 

CIA supplying airplanes to the Contras to move weapons and drugs. 

CIA moving weapons and drugs in Vietnam / Asia. 

Out of control National Security State. 

Information from Daniel Sheehan ++. 

## 1976 - CIA Smuggling 98% Weapons Grad Plutonium to Israel *and Iran*

The Karen Silkwood Case in 1976 reveals that the CIA’s Israeli Desk had been smuggling 98% bomb-grade plutonium to the State of Israel and to Iran.

## 1976 - Jimmy Carter Elected and Refused Information by George Bush on UFOs

- November 4, 1976 Jimmy Carter Elected. 
- November 19th, message to CIA director ordering him to turn over information about UFOs and Extraterrestrials. 
- George Bush refuses to give him the information, says he did not need to know. 

## 1970s - CIA Infiltrates and Manipulates CIA Movements 

In the 1970s, the CIA / [[Fascist Security State]] infiltrated and manipulated student protests in the United States. 

## 1980s and 1990s CIA Continues to Manipulate Media 

Following onto Operation Mockingbird relationships from the 40s to 70s, relationships and influence continue through: 

- The National Endowment for Democracy. 
	- Formed in 1983 as a way to do CIA operations in a more legitimate way 
	- After uproar over CIA manipulations of student movements in the 70s
- Privatization of intelligence capacities under Reagan. 
- Ongoing CIA / media relations through the 90s. 

The [[Fascist Security State]] has continually maintained a backdoor relationship between Washington Post, New York Times, Robert Murdoch, all the major broadcast media corporations... 
## 1981 - 1986 - Iran-Contra - CIA Smuggling of Weapons and Cocaine in Conjunction with the Mafia

Iran-Contra Affair. CIA smuggling weapons to Iran and the Contras in Nicaragua, in conjunction with the mafia. 

CIA smuggling cocaine into Miami to a house run by Gambino's daughter. 

## 1985 - Enrique "Kiki" Camarena Assassinated 

In 1985, DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena, close associate of top undercover agent Michael Lavine, is kidnapped, tortured, and killed. 
- Why? Because he and DEA were trying to stop the flow of drugs that the CIA was running in concert with the mafia and cartels to finance weapons programs. 
- Close relationship between CIA and godfathers of Mexico, including drug trafficking.
- Two or three Cuban CIA operatives involved in Camarena's interrogation. 
- Camarena is killed by Operation Condor assassins, run out of Pemex. 
## 1990s and 2000s - Internet Free Speech as an Instrument of Statecraft and Foreign Government Overthrow

In the 1990s, and 2000s, internet freedom and free speech is developed and accentuated as an instrument of American statecraft / CIA / DOD operations. 

From the privatization of the internet in 1991, DOD and State Department discover people are using the internet to congregate in forums, and repeatedly help dissident groups overthrow foreign governments. 

Leveraging "free speech on the internet" as a means to circumvent state control over media in foreign countries. 

Turbocharges the work with dissident groups that used to be done out of CIA station houses, Embassies, Consulates. 

The array of internet free speech technology, such as Virtual Private Networks to hide IP address, Tour - the dark web to buy and sell anonymously, end to end encrypted chats, all created initially as DARPA / CIA / NSA projects, primarily to aid CIA backed groups in the influence and overthrow of foreign governments who were causing problems during the Clinton / Bush / Obama eras. 

Organizational architecture included NGOs, tech companies, and the national security state. 

## Arab Spring 

The high water mark of internet-free-speech-as-statecraft was 2011 - 2012 and the Arab Spring. 

One by one, adversarial governments began to be toppled in Facebook / Twitter revolutions. 

The State Department worked closely with social media companies to keep platforms running during those periods. 

## Big State / Big Military / Big Tech Alliances 

Many US Big Tech companies conceived with close ties to the [[Military Industrial Complex]]. 

Google started with a DARPA grant. 

Funding from CIA / NSA to chart how "birds of a feather flock together" through search engine aggregation. 

A year later, launched as Google, and began working as a military contractor soon after. 

Purchased CIA satellite software to bring Google Maps online. 

## 2014 - US Sponsored Coup and Counter-Coup in Ukraine 

In 2014 after the US-sponsored coup in Ukraine, there was an unexpected counter coup where Crimea and Donbas broke away with a military backstop from Russia that the NATO was unprepared for. 

Crimea Annexation vote in 2014, where Crimea votes to join the Russian Federation. 

This was the last straw for free speech in the eyes of NATO. 

## 2010s - 2020 - The New Military Industrial Censorship 

Free speech as an instrument of statecraft "worked" from 1991 until 2014. 

Until Ukraine, internet free speech had tilted global affairs in favor of the [[Fascist Security State]]. 

In 2014, it went the other way. 

NATO / [[Fascist Security State]] perceived a shift in the fundamental nature of war. 

They claimed that a Russian general said ~ "We don't need to use the military to take over central and Eastern Europe. We just need to control media and social media, which controls the elections."

If you get the right adminsitration in power, they control the military and [[The Power and Instrumentalities of the State]]. 

It is infinitely cheaper and faster to conduct organized political influence operations of social and legacy media, than to wage psychical war. 

In direct violation of [[Freedom of Conscience]], [[Freedom of Thought]], and [[Freedom of Speech]], in the 2010s and 2020s, the [[Fascist Security State]] launches a new form of [[Censorship]] unlike anything in history. 

The new censorship strips citizens of the freedom to equally speak and express things online, even if true to the best of their understanding, if they are inconvenient to agenda of the [[Invisible Power Structures]]. 

In some cases, it can even become a criminal act. 

## The New Supranational Political Warfare Complex 

This leads to an entirely new supranational Military Industrial Technological Academic Complex being created, spanning the Pentagon, British Ministry of Defense, and Brussels, organized together into a political warfare complex. 

To create [[Psychological Buffer Zones]].  
To censor foreign propaganda. 
To censor right wing populist groups. 
To censor the free speech of their own citizens. 

## The Perceived Threat of Populist Groups to the Fascist Security State 

One of their great fears is the rise of populist groups, particularly on the right wing. 

Rising up due to the migrant crisis... energy shifts... foreign wars... 

For instance advocating for the use of Russian energy, at the same time US / NATO is working to stop the Nord Stream / Russian energy projects. 

Germany. Estonia. Latvia. Lithuania. 

## June 2016 - Brexit 

Then in June 2016 comes Brexit. 

For the [[Fascist Security State]] this creates a moment where not just central and Eastern Europe are threatened, but now "it" is coming westward. 

## July 2016 - Warsaw Conference 

One month later, July 2016, at the Warsaw Conference, NATO amends its charter to expressly commit to hybrid warfare as a new NATO capacity. 

This marks a significant shift from 70 years of tanks and conventional psychological operations, to an explicit new capacity to monitor, censor, and manipulate social media, legacy media, internet free speech, if *deemed to be subsersive.*

## More Perceived Threat of Domestic Populism

Simultaneously, NATO is publishing white papers on the growing threat not just of Russia, but of losing elections across Europe to right wing populist groups, working class movements, etc. 

They essentially made the argument that the World Order would collapse unless the [[Fascist Security State]] took control of social media / media. 

Fear that Brexit would give rise to Frexit (Marine Le Pen), Spexit - Vox Party, Italy, Germany, Greece... et al...

Leading to the EU coming apart (which is highly likely)... 

Leading to NATO coming apart (which is highly likely)...

Leading to no enforcement arm for the IMF and World Bank... 

Leaving financial stakeholders and the [[Invisible Power Structures]] who depend on the [[Fascist Security State]] to enforce their strangleholds on the world economy and resources helpless against foreign governments around the world. 

This moment marked a fundamental shift from a primary fear of Russia...

...to a primary fear that Citizens of their own countries would get their way. 

And with that, the [[Fascist Security State]] began *formally* weaponizing the psychological warfare capabilities it had developed internally against its own Citizens. 

## The Accelerating Shift of Censorship and Psychological Operations From Foreign to Domestic 

The intentional creation of weaponized censorship and psychological operations by NATO and the [[Fascist Security State]] was  morally justified in the eyes of the participants because it operated "out there" beyond the US, and not "in here", starting in Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, Finland, etc. 

The inevitable shift of the tide from foreign to domestic began post Crimea-Counter-Coup in 2014...
...post Brexit... and the ramped up towards full throttle after Trump won the 2016 election.  

2016 was the first time social media eclipsed the legacy media in terms of influence. 

Internet 1.0 from 1991 to 2004. 
2004 Facebook. 
2005 Twitter. 
2006 Youtube. 
2007 Smart Phones. 
From 2006 to 2016 internet / social media influence building. 

During the initial period of the internet / social media / smart phones, no individual or group is getting enough followers to compete with traditional media.. 

However post 2016 as citizen journalists and independent voices begin to outcompete the legacy media...

...it induces a massive crisis in the [[Fascist Security State]] who was not ready for it. 

Whereas the CIA / Pentagon had always had backdoor media relations, they now had not way to interface with random citizen journalists to kill stories, exchange favors, stop certain narratives from spreading. 

From early 2000s to 2014 this is not a problem because no dissident groups have a mature enough ecosystem of their own, so all the victories go where the [[Fascist Security State]] money goes. 

Post 2016, the fear rises that the entire Existing Order may collapse, along with 70 year of unbroken foreign policy from Truman to Trump. 

The National Security State then began explicitly laundering tricks developed over 70 years of meddling in foreign elections and foreign affairs...

...into the creation of a Military Censorship Industrial Complex...

...aimed at the internet, social media, and media...

...***Domestically*** (NATO wide). 

## Russiagate

What little moral and political resistance arose was washed over by Russiagate...

...if Trump was a Russian asset, censorship was no longer a free speech issue, but a national security issue. 

## The Foreign Domestic Switch 

After Russiagate died in July 2019 with Robert Muller revealing he had nothing after 2.5 years of investigation, the foreign-to-domestic switch took place. 

The [[Fascist Security State]] too the censorship architecture that spanned the DHS, FBI, CIA, DOD, DOJ, and potentially *thousands* of government-funded NGO and mercenary firms...

...and transited from a foreign predicate (Russian / Communist threat)... 

...to a Democracy predicate. 

They accomplished this by establishing that disinformation was not just a threat when it comes from the Russians...

...but also when it poses any kind of threat to democracy itself. 

## The Democracy Predicate Defined

While it was well known that the military industrial complex had been manipulating politics via money, lobbying, and influence for decades... 

...the idea that tools from information war against Soviet Union and Russia... 

...could be consciously turned against US citizens by the US government was unthinkable to many in the US. 

It is a reasonably possibility that the [[Fascist Security State]] may have turned its externally-facing capabilities inward... to rig elections in the United States... as it had in so many other countries in the past. 

Both parties adamantly claim that past elections have been rigged. 

The US had developed over decades a professional class of regime change artists and operations...

...to overthrow governments and "preserve democracy" around the world... 

...if the threats to democracy were now deemed to be homegrown...

...suddenly all these people were authorized to move onto US and European soil, and into the hearts and minds of "their own" Citizens. 

The new Democracy Predicate gives rise to a multi-billion-dollar censorship and psychological warfare industry, that joints together: 
- military industrial complex 
- government 
- private sector 
- civil society organizations 
- universities 
- vast array of media allies and professional fact checker groups 
	- who serve as the sentinel class surveilling everything on the internet and shutting down threats to the agenda of [[Fascist Security State]] 

## Global Engagement Center

For example, the State Department created the Global Engagement Center, which at the time of its establishment was foreign facing. 

They used the ISIS threat as a predicate to establish a formal coordination relationship between the State Department et al and every major technology platform in the United States. 

The rationale was that the terrorists were recruiting there. 

Global Engagement Center established to be State Department entanglement / control of social media. 

Created new technology - natural language processing / AI machine learning ability to create meaning out of words...
- in order to map everything everyone says on the internet
- and create vast topography of how communities are organized online 
- who the major influencers are
- what they are talking about 
- what narratives are emerging
- what narratives are tending 
- to create a network graph 
- to know how information moves through an ecosystem 
- to know who to target 

They began plotting the language, the prefixes, the suffixes, the popular terms, the slogans etc. that ISIS operatives were using. 

Subsequently, they would turn the technology against the citizens of the United States and Europe. 

## Exodus to NATO, Europe, and Atlantic Council 

When everyone in the State Department who was expecting promotions under Hillary was fired by Trump, a mass exodus of State Department officials moved out into NATO and the Atlantic Council, where they pressured European governments to pass censorship laws, which would ripple back through NATO and Big Tech and into the US. 

Atlantic Council has 7 former CIA directors on its board. "NATOs think tank". Annual funding from DOD, State Department, CIA cutouts like National Endowment for Democracy. 

## January 2017 - Transatlantic Attack on Free Speech

In January 2017, Atlantic Council moves to pressure European governments to pass censorship laws in the wayRick Stengel called for, that could be later mimicked by the US. 

For instance getting Germany to pass NetzDG in 2017, which kicked off the era of automated censorship in the United States. 

Unless Big Tech in US wanted to pay tens of millions in fines for each instance of (speech identified by the overlords as hate speech) left on platform for more than 48 hours...

...they had to deploy the AI based censorship technologies created by DARPA to take on ISIS to scan and ban speech automatically. 

## Censorship Science

This emergent field of censorship science binds together (the definition of fascism): 
- political and social scientists - who are the "thought leaders" on what should be censored and allowed 
- the quants / programmers / computational data scientists 
- linguists
- over 60 universities who get federal government grants 
	- to do the censorship preparation work 
	- and the censorship work 
	- by creating code books 
	- of the language that people use 
	- around certain topics and themes
	- in the same way they did for ISIS

For instance with Covid...
- developed Covid lexicons of what narratives were emerging
- about mandates, masks, vaccines, etc. 
- about high profile individuals whose reputations needed to be protected 
- about individuals whose reputations needed to be savaged 
- created code books 
- broke things down into narratives 
- Atlantic Council was part of the government funded consortium called the Virality Project 
	- mapped 66 different narratives  
	- broken down into factual subclaims  
	- plugged into machine learning models  
	- to forge a world "heat map" of what was being thought and said about Covid  
- Whenever something started to trend that was bad for what the [[Fascist Security State]] wanted...
- ...they could instantly take down 10s of millions of posts
- *even if the posts were True*
## From Democracy, to Deep State Military Rule

We are rapidly drifting from a vestige of democracy, to straight up military rule by a fascist international Deep State who views the elected puppet politicians who come and go with disdain. 

The dual rise of grotesque lies and deceit of Congress and We The People...

...along with the rise of the Military Censorship Industrial Complex...

...is the direct and antithetical inversion of the entire idea of participatory democratic governance. 

## From Democracy, to "Democratic Institutions"

The deep state has been moving rapidly to invert the underpinnings of democratic society by transforming the definition of democracy from being about the will of We The People...

...to being about the sanctity of "democratic institutions"...

...which they define as the collusive members of the [[Fascist Security State]] / military / NATO / IMF / World Bank / Mainstream Media / NGOs (largely state department funded) / etc. 

If the [[Fascist Security State]] redefines Democracy as the strength of democratic institutions...

...rather than the Will of the people...

...then democracy simply becomes the political consensus building architecture within the corrupt and self-proclaimed institutions themselves. 
## The Post WWII American Order, and the Grunch of Giants 

“There is no dictionary word for an army of invisible giants, one thousand miles tall, with their arms interlinked, girding the planet Earth. ***Since there exists*** just such an invisible, abstract, legal-contrivance ***army of giants***, we have invented the word GRUNCH as the group designation — “a grunch of giants.” GR-UN-C-H, which stands for annual GROSS UNIVERSE CASH HEIST"

The grunch of giants ([[The Giants]]) consists of the corporately interlocked owners of a vast invisible empire dominated by the [[Invisible Power Structures]], which includes airwaves, electromagnetism, and satellites; plus a vast visible empire, which includes all the post-WWII skyscraper cluster cities around the world, as well as the factories and research laboratories remotely ringing the old cities and all the Asian industrial deployment, such as in Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. 

It controls the financial credit system of the noncommunist world together with all the financial means of initiating any world-magnitude mass-production and -distribution ventures. 

By making employment contracts with almost all promising university science students, it monopolizes all the special theoretical know-how to exploit its vast inventory of already acquired invisible know-how technology. 

***Who runs GRUNCH? Nobody knows. It controls all the world’s banks.*** 
Even the muted Swiss banks. 

It does what its lawyers tell it to. It maintains technical legality, and is prepared to prove it. With [[Fascist Security State]] backing if necessary. 

## Politics and the Puppet Governments of the Invisible Power Structures 

***While the admirals of each nation of Spaceship Earth war over their competing claims and threaten to rip the ship asunder, nobody is paying any attention to operating the ship or steering it towards its Destination.*** 

Meanwhile, the USA and other countries are plagued by corrupted political puppet shows strictly and only representing the interests of those who can afford to get them elected. 

While the [[Fascist Security State]] limits the amount an individual Employee Consumer Slave can give to a candidate to $3,300, billionaires can openly commit *tens of millions of dollars a month* to a candidate. 

For the 2024 presidential election, candidates are expected to collectively spend ***over $10 Billion***. 

In such an environment, only [[Invisible Power Structures]]-backed candidates can win, which means we are no longer living in a democracy. 

The network's people, aware that the TV era governments are corrupt, spontaneously abhor and abstain from further voting, and the corrupt system lurches towards its demise. 

It is hopefully becoming obvious why humanity’s most fundamental problems cannot be solved by [[Politics]] within the Invisible-Power-Structure-Puppeted systems creating them.

## Killing Tens or Hundreds of Thousands of People a Day

Think of stadium packed with tens of thousands of people. 

Each and every day, [[The Giants]] and the [[Invisible Power Structures]] puppeting them murder tens or hundreds of thousands of people a day consciously, carelessly, and in pure cold blood in exchange for narrow profits and self-gain. 

25,000 a day dead from starvation. Tens of thousands dead from self-and-corporate-inflicted disease. Tens of thousands dead from poverty-and-ignorance-induced unnecessary suffering of all manner. 200,000 babies a day killed by abortion. **EVERY SINGLE DAY.***

Each and every day, of each and every year, a figurative nuclear weapon is dropped on a stadium full of citizens, and three stadiums full of future citizens, and it doesn't make the news. 

This [[Invisible Power Structures]] backed daily killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings, and millions of innocent plants and animals, dwarfs the [[Invisible Power Structures]] backed holocaust by the Third Reich it financed.  

And it is ongoing each and every day. 

## The Fraudulent and Illegitimate Existing Order

At the termination of his presidency, Eisenhower expressed his shocked dismay over the exclusively self-concerned [[Military Industrial Complex]] that he had found to be growing inexorably as a **malignant socioeconomic organism**.

If we look honestly, we have a bit of a problem. 

1. Our property rights are fraudulent and invalid  
2. Our debt-based monetary system is fraudulent and invalid  
3. Our fascist wars are fraudulent and invalid  
4. Our political systems are fraudulent and invalid 
5. Our Existing Order is fraudulent and invalid 
6. Our way of being together as a human species is destroying society and the earth  

And the vast majority of humanity is asleep in a state of [[Employee Consumer Debt Slavery]] that they did not consent to. 

It is time to wake up, unite, and venture out of slavery, through [[The Wilderness]] and towards [[The Promised Land]].
