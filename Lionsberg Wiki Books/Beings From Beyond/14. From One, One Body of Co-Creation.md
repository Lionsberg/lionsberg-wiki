# 14. From One, One Spirit and Body of Co-Creation

From [[One]], [[All]] Reality arises as It's Living Embodiment. 

[[All Creation]] emerges and arises as the Manifest and Interexistent Body of the [[One]]. 

All existence is one interexistent [[Living System]]. 

The [[All]] is, as it were, the Body of [[One]], interexisting breathing, vibrating, and evolving towards the fullness of [[Potential]] empowered by the [[Central Animating Spirit]] the permeates and sustains the Universe. 

[[One]] and [[All]] are the limit statements that conceptually bound the System. The [[Central Animating Spirit]] is what lives and breathes the System. 

**All Co-Creation Is One Body, Animated by One Spirit.**
