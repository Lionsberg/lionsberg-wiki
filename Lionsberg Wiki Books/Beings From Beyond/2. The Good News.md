# 2. The Good News

The Good News is that there is hope, many of us chose or were chosen to be here to meet this moment, and together, united as One Force For Good across the forces of Heaven and Earth, anything is possible. 

The forces of Evil are ultimately no match for the forces of Good; nevertheless, they don't fight themselves or release the the parasitical grip of their talons willingly.
