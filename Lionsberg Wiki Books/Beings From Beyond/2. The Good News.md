# 2. The Good News

The Good News is that there is hope, many of us chose or were chosen to be here to meet this moment, and together, united as One Force For Good across the forces of Heaven and Earth, anything is possible. 

The forces of Evil are ultimately no match for the forces of Good; nevertheless, they don't fight themselves or release the the parasitical grip of their talons willingly. 

Further, the level of absolute corruption, fraud, and deceit promulgated by the [[Fascist Security State]]s and their invisible puppeteers that has now come to Light represents the greatest, and perhaps only, opportunity in generations to Refound our Civilization and Resecure Liberty, Truth, and Justice for all current and future generations of life.
