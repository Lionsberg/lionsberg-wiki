# 6. Navigating Towards Wisdom and Truth

As we venture out of [[The Caves]], [[Beyond The Boundary]] of the [[Old World]], and into [[The Wilderness]] of the [[Unknown]], remember that [[Out Here]], [[We Do Not Know]].  

Everything is [[New]]. 

Wisdom and Truth is present everywhere [[Out Here]], but they are concealed. They must be continually searched out. 

[[Beyond The Boundary]], we do not regard Wisdom and Truth as something to be attained, but rather something to be eternally navigated towards. 

Wisdom and Truth have the amazing Quality of receding as We approach them, and the Wisest people recognize they have the farthest to go.
