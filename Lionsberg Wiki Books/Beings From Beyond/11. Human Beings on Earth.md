# 11. Human Beings on Earth

To begin, let us Center. 

You Are Here. 

A Human Being. On Earth. 

You probably believe in plants and animals. 

You probably have related with an animal intimately enough to understand that they are sentient, conscious, and experience feeling and emotion. Maybe even in ways you have found shockingly intelligent or similar to your own experience. 

It can be tempting to think that humans are the most intelligent form of Life in Universe. 

It can be tempting to think that Life has only ever existed on Earth. 

Where did it all come from? Where did it all begin? Where are We? Who are We? Why are We Here? How did we get [[Here]]? What else is Out There?
