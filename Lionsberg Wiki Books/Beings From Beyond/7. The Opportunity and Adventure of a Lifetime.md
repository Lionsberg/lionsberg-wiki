# 7. The Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime

Welcome to the [[Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]]. 

On the other side of [[The Wilderness]] lies [[The Promised Land]].  

In the story of [[The Exodus]], We wandered in the desert for 40 years, and an entire generation and their beliefs had to die in [[The Wilderness]]. We can do better this Time. 

If We [[Progress]] efficiently and effectively along  [[The Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]], We should be able to reach the other side within the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]].  

In the [[The Promised Land]], after we reclaim [[Our Collective Inheritance]] that has been stolen and concealed from us, we will rediscover that [[We Are All Billionaires]]. 

The Adventure Begins.
