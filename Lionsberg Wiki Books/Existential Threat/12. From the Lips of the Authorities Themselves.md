# 12. From the Lips of the Authorities Themselves

We now Know that **WE ARE NOT ALONE**. 

Perhaps you are still wondering. Perhaps you have not yet experienced angels, demons, aliens, extraterrestrials, and ultra-dimensional beings for your Self... 

So let Us slow down and recount some of the Evidence, and hear from the lips of some of those engaged in the Controlled Disclosure We are attempting to rapidly transcend and leave behind. 

It is a strange trap, because in [[The Caves]] of the Kontrolle Structure, We were brainwashed to believe The Authorities who We now KNOW were systematically deceiving and exploiting Us. 

We will soon transcend them and their False Authority entirely. 

However their words, cautiously heard, can help serve as a psychological bridge towards Liberty. 

We will cite many officials and authorities below, whose conclusions, vision, or values We may not agree with, purely for the purpose of attempting to establish a [[Catastrophic Disclosure]] of the Reality of Extraterrestrial and Ultradimensional Life and Consciousness On Earth and Beyond. 

We have to get that behind Us. Now. We do not have another year to debate whether the Extraterrestrial and Ultradimensional Beings and Craft manifesting in Our Way are Real. 

They are Real. They are Here. 

**WE ARE NOT ALONE**. 

Following are 10,000+ words from an array of authoritative lips, which should shatter any remaining doubts or misconceptions regarding whether Extraterrestrial and Ultradimensional Life exists on Earth and Beyond. 

As We explore them, let Us remember than many of the speakers are firmly controlled by the Kontrolle Structure, and are parts of the Campaign of Controlled Disclosure the false authorities are undertaking. Many of them are also wonderful and well intended. 

We can read them in detail... We can map them, chart them, and follow their leads... or We can simply skim them so that we can hear pastors, presidents, and priests, soldiers, senators, and sailors, laymen, lawyers, and lawmen, and everyday citizens like Jordan, exclaim together in unison: 

**WE ARE NOT ALONE**.

As We read, let Us keep three things in mind: 

1. The false authorities want Us to think that "the phenomenon" is real, but that "we" cannot explain them and do not know what "they" are. This is a lie. The false authorities know what they are. We know what they are. 
2. The false authorities want to confine the discussion primarily to the reverse engineering of alien craft and technology, while working hard to keep attention off of the more important questions about **WHO** is developing and piloting the advanced crafts and technologies, and the reality of face to face contact, communication, agreements, and conflicts with and between these multiple extraterrestrial civilizations.  
3. The false authorities want to continue embezzling trillions of dollars from a deceived, divided and conquered world population, in order to wage endless wars and perpetuate a fascist military / industrial / weapons regime seeking Full Spectrum Dominance over the Earth and Beyond.  
4. The Invisible Power Structures in Kontrolle of this "disclosure" are operating at planetary scale and beyond, far beyond the reaches of any constitutional government or Visible Power Structure on Earth. And they *are not merely human.*  
5. "Voting" in any election on Earth is not going to accomplish anything. Every vote is an act of participation, submission and consent in the inherently fraudulent Kontrolle Structure / Existing Order, and further enslaves humanity in The Matrix. 

In summary, We are providing the perspectives below simply to affirm the Reality that what many of Us are experiencing is True, and to rapidly get Us All on the same page regarding the Existence and Presence of multiple civilizations and species of these highly advanced, non-human beings We co-exist with.  

Once that is out of the Way, We can rediscover Who We Are, and what we ought to Do in light of all We are coming to Know. 
## We Are Not Alone, As Spoken From a Diverse Array of Credible Voices 

We have confirmation of the existence of a diverse array of highly advanced non-human extraterrestrial species via the sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste of millions of government, military, and civilian witnesses, along with photos, videos, radar, and readings from the most advanced military equipment on our aircraft carrier fleets, jets, drones, and satellites, alongside the vast array of purpose-built water, land, air, and space based sensors in the "Immaculate Constellation" revealed in October 2024. 

We also have evidence of these creatures and phenomenon going back millennia in the Bible and the records and oral traditions of nearly every indigenous tribe and tradition on Earth. 

The paragraphs are numbered so they can be researched, vetted, and discussed in Community.

	2. Obama: That's why you will not be President... **the aliens won't let it happen... You'd reveal all their secrets. They exercise strict control over us**. 
	3. Kimmel presses more... 
	4. Obama: I can't reveal anything...
	5. Kimmel: Oh really, because President Clinton said he did check... and there was nothing...
	6. Obama: Well, you know, that is what we are instructed to say.

117. "In the end I have to say I was still extraordinarily disappointed in the New York Times (2017 article), because they focused on this small AATIP program and the real story, in my mind at least, should have been "**These things are real, they are here, this is happening now**."" - [[Christopher Mellon]], former Deputy Asst. Sec of Defense for Intelligence for both Clinton and Bush. 

118. "...the headline hits, "**WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE**." It is preposterous that this is still the superimposed... "government sanctioned" point of view... We have not been introduced to any of this as a world civilization... We are still in a segmented, fragmented world when it comes to any of this information. Leaks give you hints, **what we need is the whole truth and the big picture about who is interacting with us, our planet, why**, and how many of our own military forces... have been going out to other solar systems since at least 1972... and the disconnect between what human beings may already be existing in other solar systems in a military way, versus a planet that has still not even been told the truth. That disconnect... has to end." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]  

119. In 2023, in sworn testimony before the United States Congress, senior intelligence officer [[David Grusch]] revealed the existence of a multi-decade program to retrieve and reverse engineer alien craft and advanced technologies. He clarified under questioning that the United States was in possession of both extraterrestrial craft and the bodies of the non-human beings who piloted some of the craft. 

120. [[Jordan]]: We know from an array of other sources that the alien bodies recovered along with the craft included both living and dead creatures.

	1. [[Jordan]]: We now know of multiple bases where aliens and humans work side by side. 

122. Brigadier General Steven Lovekin, U.S. Army Reserve: "A small group in the government has access to information about extraterrestrial craft and has kept this information from the public."

123. Leading up to the 2023 congressional hearings in the United States, researchers such as Dr. Steven Greer, Daniel Sheehan, John Mack, etc. vetted, debriefed, and identified *over 700 high-level government and corporate whistleblowers willing to testify regarding the UFO / extraterrestrial phenomena*. Greer was asked to brief several sitting US Presidents and governments around the world. 

124. The Disclosure Project Internet Archive went live in 2024 at [DPIArchive.com](https://www.dpiarchive.com), making hundreds of whistleblower / witness accounts and thousands of pages of documents, photos, videos, interviews, and other collectively irrefutable evidence to the the public. 

125. In sworn congressional testimony: 
	1. House Representative Ogles: Would you have had the ability to defend your crew, your aircraft? (from the extraterrestrial craft) 
	2. Graves: Absolutely not. 
	3. [[David Grusch]]: No. 

126. [[David Grusch]]: The UAP Task Force was refused access to **a broad retrieval program**. 
	1. Interviewer: We have **spacecraft from another species**? 
	2. David Grusch: We do.
	3. Interviewer: How many? 
	4. David: Quite a number. 
	5. Interviewer: You are kidding. 
	6. David. No. I have plenty of current and senior former intelligence officers who came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career... they provided me... oral testimony... documents... and other proof. 
	7. Interviewer: I have been told there have been **attempts to bring down the craft**. 
	8. David: There have been instances, and there are, uh, certain techniques. 
	9. Interviewer: Have human beings been hurt or killed by a non-human intelligence. 
	10. David: While I can't get into the specifics... I was briefed... that there were malevolent events like that. 
	11. Interviewer: You are telling us that we are being lied to. 
	12. David: Yes. 

127. John Lear "On The Record" in 1987: "I'll give you the bottom line... I have found out that the government has retrieved between 10 and 15 actual flying saucers, three of which have been in perfect condition, one of which they tried to fly... they have **between 30 and 50 alien bodies in cryogenic storage**... they represent **at least five different civilizations**. Let me read to you what the Air Force says about the bodies.... I am going to read from the Introductory Space Science, Volume II, Department of Physics, United States Air Force Academy. This is Chapter 13 Unidentified Flying Objects. Now this is what the Air Force has the students at the Air Force Academy read. And it says "The most commonly described alien is about three and half feet tall, has a round head, arms reaching to or below his knees, and is wearing a silvery space suit... (the volume continues: "Other aliens appear to be essentially the same as Earthmen, while still others have particularly wide (wrap-around) eyes and mouths with very thin lips. And then there is a rare group reported as about four feet tall...(descriptions of other species continue))... you can pick out an Air Force physics book and read this stuff..." 

128. On page 466, 33.6 Conclusion, the physics book adds "From available information, the UFO phenomenon appears to have been **global in nature for almost 50,000 years**.  

129. The Vatican even has chimed in, with high ranking officials making statements such as: 
	1. "In light of the discovery of more and more of these exoplanets, **it has now become clear that *much sooner than previously anticipated* we are going to discover life elsewhere in our universe**, and because of that, the time has now arrived for the beginning of a serious discussion among all of our people about what are the most profound philosophical and theological questions are, that are going to be posed to our human family, by the discovery of life elsewhere in our universe." 
	2. "We are not talking about the discovery of just some single celled life form underneath a frozen lake on the moon of some distant planet. **We are talking here about another highly intelligent, highly technologically developed but distinctly non-human species right here in our own galaxy.**" 
	3. Quotes from Vatican officials per [[Daniel Sheehan]], former Jesuit General Council 

130. "**The question in my mind is not *what*, but *who*?** I know what they are. Hynek knows what they are. The United States Government knows what they are. The Soviet government knows what they are. Everyone who has done any investigation in depth knows what they are." - Dr. Walter Martin 

131. "Yes. There are extraterrestrials. Aliens if you want to them that. And... there are man made craft... doing abductions, human trafficking, drug trafficking, they are being misused all over the place..." - [[Stephen Greer]]  

132. [[Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke]] has conducted hundreds of interviews with indigenous peoples of North and South America who confirm their longstanding interactions with "sky people", "sky gods", inter-dimensional beings, aliens, and ancestors from numerous star systems beyond the planet.

133. The US government funded a UFO investigation called AAWSAP, overseen by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The two men who managed the overall objectives and the day to day operations of AAWSAP, veteran intelligence analyst and rocket scientist Dr. James Lacatski and his colleague Dr. Colm Kelleher, helped compile the most comprehensive UFO database ever assembled. Among those 200,000 UFO cases and incidents were some stunning, seemingly inexplicable demonstrations of technology that appeared far more advanced than anything known to exist on Earth. 
	1. [[James Lacatski]]: "The Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) was basically created between myself and Senator Reed." 
	2. "You might say it was test of various components of a UFO UAP paranormal research program right from the beginning it included all aspects of both UFOs and the Paranormal in relationship to UFOs... 
	3. "Bob Bigelow's BASS (was) created specifically (for the program) and that was so important to DIA specifically to address our needs..."
	4. Jeremy Corbell (reading from Skinwalkers At The Pentagon): "at the conclusion of a 2011 meeting in the Capitol building with a US senator and an agency under secretary Lacatski... Dr Lacatski (stated) that the United States was in possession of a craft of Unknown Origin and had successfully gained access to its interior... this craft had a streamlined configuration suitable for aerodynamic flight but no intakes exhaust wings or control surfaces... in fact it appeared not to have an engine fuel tanks or fuel... 
	5. What this is... is you're officially allowed to tell us that the United States government has in its possession a craft of Unknown Origin and you are able to access the inside is that correct?
	6. [[James Lacatski]]: The wording that you're you read is correct. 
	7. "We had no choice but to pursue both aspects" (UFO and the psychic / spiritual / paranormal aspects)... 
	8. From book: "DHS facilities... Department of Homeland Security officials became very hesitant and even fearful of moving forward. Perhaps these two only belatedly realized t**he unique game-changing and Earth shattering nature of the biggest secret ever kept by the United States**..."
		1. This is significant coming from the people who ran AAWSAP, and having passed DOPSR (defense department prepublication review). 
	9. Jeremy: 
		1. "So on one hand you're telling me there's disinfo even within intelligence servers and systems where you can cover up your programs...
		2. but you're also telling me UFOs... our government knows... 
		3. ...and that we have them...
		4. ...we've been inside of one of them...
		5. you've admitted it now I don't know that anybody from the DIA from your level of the intelligence agency, running a UFO program, has ever admitted publicly before that we have a UFO and have been inside of it... 
	10. "it's true yes okay you're telling us you told us because you were allowed to tell us that our government has a UFO in its possession and has been able to access the inside of it.."
	11. Colm: "I think um even beyond the Brazilian cases I think we accumulated enough cases within the United States to say that you know if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time um in terms of proximity to UFOs, in terms of proximity to blue orbs,  that you can come off the worst. You'll have a lot of symptoms that mimic radiation sickness for example, you know metallic taste in the mouth, sunburn, your hair starts falling out... we documented the these cases and if you add that to uh the events in Colares (Brazil) you can make the statement that UFOs are really bad for your health."
	12. "One of the things that we sort of focused on in the book um was correlating... some of the aspects of UFO performance like lift and propulsion, power generation, spatial temporal translation, and we we generated a bunch of different cases from the historical literature..."
	13. "...visual sighting, instrumented sighting, radar sightings of this UFO that essentially outgunned, them outmaneuvered them, and this was all the way back in July of 1957. So you cannot say this was a Chinese high-speed drone"
	14. "..there needs to be, certainly a database that needs to be upkept and also constructed properly..."
	15. Jeremy: "Jim... do you think the American public deserves to know about the ultimate reality... the fact that there are appear to be non-human intelligence flying spacecraft or something that look like them... and we are trying to reverse engineer them?..."
	16. Jim: "Yes, and that is why we're doing these books." 
	17. "...this involves (national security)... plus... having come from the (defense) contractor world in the first half of my career I can say if there's heavy investment of contractor capital... into these technologies... and they've been given these technologies...  they're going to hang onto them..." 
	18. "it's going to be difficult to pry loose technology when something's been given over... and a private company has invested their money and their stockholders money into research... so that's an entirely different aspect..."
	19. Jeremy: I get it that private companies who have been given these technologies have invested a lot of money, but isn't this topic kind of bigger... the fact that we might not be alone?" 
	20. Jim: Well yes, but I think we can convey that through the proper method. 
	21. Colm: there's a a lot to do with manipulation of perception so a technology that is both influential in terms of you know leaving an imprint on the ground that you can extrapolate that this thing weighed 2 and a half tons to altering people's psychic makeup... um there's really no contradiction there.
	22. ...putting them into one box you know the nuts and bolts box or only the psychic box just doesn't work. You've got to balance the the idea that a technology can manipulate human perception and even from a long-term perspective **manipulate human cultural phenomena** as well as you know operate as a machine. So you've got to hold those two balls in the air and if you're not capable of doing that you should not be looking at UFOs.

134. "My father was the reverend Turner Holz (spelling?). And he came to visit me one day, and we were talking, and he said, "You know, there is something I want to tell you... I think that someone in family should know about this besides me. I was sworn to secrecy by my cousin Cordell Hull (who was Secretary of State under Roosevelt and a significant architect of the United Nations)." He told me about going to Washington for a conference... ministers from all denominations from all over the country. So while he was there he and his cousin Cordell Hull... got together at the... capital building, and (Cordell) said that he wanted to show him something, but you have to swear that you will never ever tell anybody. And he did, so they started down, down, down the building, and they went down through the regular basement into a subbasement in the Capitol building... they went through a long hallway... and Cordell opened the door and reached in and switched on the light, and he said "Now this is something really strange that is going on here"... and there were three or four large jugs on some kind of a stand that had these little people in them... and he said "Well, they were like people, but they weren't." So the Cordell Hull called his attention to some kind of a machine, that he said was a flying machine of some sort, and dad said "Well doesn't it need wings?"... As time went on he realized that somebody should know about this. And as time went on... I (also) thought "this just must be told", because the Roswell thing made me think "something is going on." I think the reason dad was appointed to this committee in Washington called "World Order", it was that they were afraid that they would be invaded by a lot of these so-called creatures, and goodness only knows what would happen. And dad's job was, in this area, to help calm people down and help people cope, and find other people who could help cope with an invasion from one of these other solar systems." - two daughters of Reverend Turner Holz

135. [[Jordan]]: The account above is significant because Cordell Hull won election to the Senate in 1930, and resigned in 1933 to become Secretary of State. Hull chaired the advisory committee on post-war foreign policy, which began in 1942. He was "the underlying force and architect of the United Nations, as recognized by the 1945 Nobel Prize for Peace, an honor for which Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him.... Hull and his staff drafted the "[Charter of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter "United Nations Charter")" in mid-1943." (Wikipedia). Crucially, we will discover that the 64 page legislation on UAP Controlled Disclosure has a disclosure "start date" in 1945, two years before Roswell. However this account from the daughters of Turner Holz places a crashed disc and its alien pilots in the Capitol building in the 30s or early 40s at the latest. These earlier dates are corroborated by numerous sources, including [[William Tompkins]], who confirmed that the United States military was aware of these alien species and craft, and Nazi / Reptilian partnership, prior to World War II. Holz's daughters believed that their father viewed the aliens and their craft at the Capitol building in the 1930s. 
136. The US Secretary of State and architect of the United Nations, therefore, had the alien reality principally in mind prior to the War, throughout the war, and throughout the inception of the United Nations and the formation of the Post WWII world order, and had engaged ministers across the United States in a "World Order" conference in response to the alien threat. Also note that on the eve of the holocaust in 1939, Hull made the decision to reject the SS St. Louis, a ship carrying 936 asylum seeking Jews. In 1940, Hull gave strict orders to every USA consulate worldwide forbidding the issuing of visas to Jews. Also note that it was the same families via [[Brown Brothers Harriman]] et al financing the rise of the Third Reich and providing resources, technologies, and capabilities to both the Nazis and the US. 
137. Further note that the United States never declared war on Germany, and that after the war, thousands of high ranking Nazi officers and scientists were imported into the US military, government, and space programs, as many of the rest went down to their bases in Antarctica and South America. According to [[Paul Hellyer]], [[Linda Moulton Howe]], and numerous whistleblowers, the Antarctica base(s) are still in operation. Paul Hellyer stated that by the time Admiral Bird was defeated in Operation High Jump and returned wanting to use nuclear weapons against the Nazi / alien base (1947), the Nazis / fascists had already gained control of the US Military / deep state and refused to intervene. Note that 1947 was also the year that the National Security Act of 1947 authorized the reorganization of US defense and intelligence, the creation of the CIA, etc., at the recommendation of the [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], and that [[Allen Dulles]], general council at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], was the first and longest serving director of the CIA, overseeing the overthrows of multiple governments, murders and assassinations around the world, the MK Ultra programs, etc. 
138. According [[Daniel Sheehan]] it was [[Allen Dulles]] who approved the assassination of JFK. 
139. [[William Tompkins]] also passionately pled that the "United States" did not "win" a world war against the Nazis... also citing extraterrestrial involvement and bases on Antarctica and the moon. 

140. "I have no doubt whatsoever, zero doubt, that there is an element inside our government structures, that is part of the intelligence community, that is part of the military, that have direct knowledge about the existence of **these extraterrestrial beings that are here on the planet**. The question then would be, in light of the fact that they know they are here,... that it would be almost *impossible* to believe that they hadn't made efforts to have some kind of communication with them. They aren't just going to let them sit there. They clearly would have made the effort to have communication with them. So the next question you have to ask is, is it reasonable to believe that the beings would have communicated with them? There does seem to be some kind of tacit understanding that they have about being able to coexist in some way, whereby the United States government is not just going to run out say "Hey everybody, there are beings from another star system here on our planet." So **they obviously have some kind of protocol established** here where they are not going to be revealing it, and the beings themselves are not just going to land in Central Park and tell everybody." - [[Daniel Sheehan]]  

141. History Channel Narrator: "J Rod was one of the crash survivors, and worked directly with our own government. Captain [[Bill Uhouse]], a former Navy pilot who later worked for the US Air Force performing experimental testing on aircraft, was assigned to Area 51 in the mid 1960s. He claims he not only studied the craft that crashed in Kingman Arizona, but also had direct contact with J Rod."

142. Bill Uhouse: "We had a long period of introduction into meeting, you know, an alien... and I called him J Rod, that was the name the linguist gave him. And he'd talk, he would talk, but if you spoke, he would sound just like you... basically it was only engineering or science advice."
	1. Bill is likely referring to telepathic communication 

143. Narrator: "There was also another whistleblower by the name of Dan Burish... who said he was hired as a microbiologist to basically care for J Rod, ensuring that he remained healthy, and this went on for years. According to Dan Burish and Bill Uhouse, J Rod was housed in a special underground chamber at Area 51, and there have been **numerous other accounts of extraterrestrials working with the United States Government**. There are a lot of stories of how we worked with the aliens at Area 51, or some say at a base nearby (referring to S4)... and **we have been working with them in underground labs** and they have been sharing information for us to enhance our technologies."

144. "All sorts of things, including **the armada** that flew South over Europe... of about 50 UFOs... The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe... ordered a study to be done, and it took three years. And what the study concluded was that there had been **at least four species, at least four, visiting Earth for thousands of years**. This is not a new phenomenon... and **predates what we call our modern history of the last ten or fifteen thousand years**." - [[Paul Hellyer]] 

145. Hundreds of military officials, including those guarding the most powerful weapons on the planet at our nuclear sites, who are on the PRP (Personal Responsibility Program) reporting if they take even an over the counter painkiller, claim to consistently see UFOs in the most restricted airspaces of the planet, that they are powerless to counteract (see the book *UFOs and Nukes* by Robert Hastings). The extraterrestrial forces often appear in disc or tic tak shaped objects, and are capable of arming and disarming our nuclear missiles at will, overriding systems, altering missile trajectories, etc. 

146. "The people that say this is not a repeatable thing... it is just not true... it is just that they are ignorant. I mean, **the only thing worse than being ignorant, is being ignorant, and then arrogant about it**... and lots of people are... So I have just ignored that... There is a whole other level of human people in our family who are not ignorant, that follow protocols and try to figure out what is really going on, and that is what we are talking about here. And one of most important issues that this element of our human family deals with is the UFO issue. And the reality is that **it mixes in with these psychic faculties**..." - [[Daniel Sheehan]]

147. "...So even thought you have something as, dare I say prosaic, as extraterrestrial beings who have been like 2 billion years more technologically advanced than we are, and psychically advanced than we are, who have figured out how to come and go from our planet, ok, BANG... But then then is all this other stuff, all this other strange phenomenon that goes on at our planet, that exists at this other level of insight, such as the capacities of our human family. **Telepathy, teleportation, astrotravel, remote viewing, transmutation of matter**... but what we have done is we've culturally riveted on some of these beings from the past... it is extraordinarily important... people who gufaw at it and poke fun at it are not only ignorant, but they are arrogant! ...they are still stuck in the scientific, logical, positivist, materialist worldview. It is institutionalized at the academy and the university level, and therefore you can't get cutting edge exploration on the part of some of the better minds of our human family, they won't allow it. Philosophy, theology, any of them, you can't go there." - [[Daniel Sheehan]]  

148. "They are still, like lighting rocket fuel on fire and burning it to shoot a rocket up into space, and they are spilling billions of dollars on that, ***as a front operation.*** (SpaceX), etc. are totally a front for what is really known about the way that these craft really work... They ran into a major problem that **they were not able to pilot the craft, because it is *consciousness* that pilots the craft.**"

149. Zulu shaman [[Credo Mutwa]] confirmed that the alien species recently entering Western consciousness have long been known, directly experienced, and feared by the African tribes. He states that even the most powerful warrior tribes have for millennia lived in fear of the small greys and the advanced reptilian race that has controlled the Earth for millennia, who are well known to abduct humans and harvest human fluids, sperm, and eggs. 

150. Multiple US soldiers reported experiences with upright reptilians in the caves and jungles of Vietnam, and with six-fingered giants in the mountains of Afghanistan. Note that these reports perfectly match with the descriptions of the six-fingered Nephalim giants in the Bible (extraterrestrial / human hybrids).  

151. Local villagers in Vietnam report the reality of tall upright reptilian beings living deep in the jungle caves. 

152. Mutwa adamantly shared the memories and present experiences of tribes around the world, and the most ancient tablets we have from Sumeria and Mesopotamia, which indicate that these species have been involved in genetic manipulation, interbreeding, and hybridization of and with humans for millennia. 

153. [[Linda Moulton Howe]] has spent the last 45 years investigating alien presence on Earth and beyond after being alerted to the bloodless, trackless, laser-precision mutilations of countless thousands of animals around the world. 
154. The dead animals had fluids, organs, fetuses, and flesh removed with some form of advanced precision technology far beyond human surgical ability. 
155. Scavengers always stay 10 to 15 feet away and will not touch the bodies, and audiovisual equipment and batteries rapidly drain and malfunction. Both of these evidencing electromagnetic radiation from the bodies.
156. Sheriff Tex Graves, who had been investigating hundreds of the bloodless, trackless, precision mutilations since the 1960s told Linda in the 1979, "**Linda, I will save you some time. The perpetrators of these bloodless trackless mutilations are creatures from outer space.**"  
157. Numerous ranchers and local citizens around the world report seeing crafts and beams of light around the time of the mutilations. Some have seen the animals transported into the alien crafts in beams of light. Some have seen reptilians, greys, and gorilla or sasquatch-type creatures associated with the crafts.  

158. [[Jordan]]: Regarding the mutilation and harvesting of domestic and wild animals and humans around the world, see the decades of evidence and countless thousands of cases documented through the work of researchers such as [[Linda Moulton Howe]] and [[Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke]].  

159. Senator Harry Reid: I became terribly interested in this, and rather than think about it, I said, well I am going to do something about it. 
	1. News Nation: In 2007 Reid and others Senators authorized the black budget study of UFOs AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Application Program)... The contract was awarded to BAAS (spelling?), a purpose-built offshoot of Bigelow Aerospace, owned by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire who had funded his own UFO studies for years. 
	2. George Knapp: AAWSAP created **the world's largest UFO database and data warehouse, 200,000 cases**... in depth reports of different topics... so much more advanced that anything anyone has seen. Congress has not seen one page of that stuff. The public has not seen one page of it... I don't think the DIA can find it. 

160. George Knapp: We have seen these reports and documents and photos and information from the Navy about these "drones" buzzing their ships, and they don't know where they came from, they can't track them..." 
	1. Senator Harry Reid: "**They are coming in swarms, swarms of them, like bees, like insects.**"

161. "A woman named Karen... was furious... because she had been abducted, and **after she had been returned... she found she was pregnant**, and she hadn't been with anyone for over a year, and she didn't know what was going on... and she went all the way through to the end of the first trimester, and she was going to the obstetrician, and couldn't figure out what was going on, and **then she gets abducted again, and she is not pregnant anymore**. And she was just furious about what they were doing with her. So when they would show up again, she would actually throw things at them, throw lamps at them, kick them... So these three little dudes show up in her living room... brought her onto the craft, now totally conscious about it... and then they bring her to this other place, took her off the craft... and **there was this little hybrid two year old girl... kind of stringy hair, and big eyes, but she knew instantaneously that it was her daughter...**" - [[Daniel Sheehan]]   

162. Note from J: Jordan had multiple men and women personally testify to him of their experiences of abductions relating to reproductive issues and medical experimentation. 

163. [[John Mack]], head of Harvard's psychiatry department, wrote a book called Abduction which is a source for sampling highly credible and vetted testimonies regarding abduction experiences. 

164. [[Daniel Sheehan]] on [[John Mack]]: "I represented him for ten years, and met dozens of people that he had worked with, was involved in vetting them to determine which ones were credible and which ones weren't, what detailed information they had, and have talked to several absolutely, totally credible witnesses that I could put in front of any American jury, and the jury would be absolutely clear they were telling the truth, who have had **direct face to face contact with one or more of these extraterrestrial beings**. **They have them in American underground military bases. They have the beings.** They have interviewed the beings. They are telepathic, they talk French to French people, and German to German people... In one of the cases... it was clear that it was voluntary, the extraterrestrial being was voluntarily talking with them... he was being interviewed."
	1. Jordan head other officials speak of non-voluntary detention, interrogation, torture, etc. 

165. "Barbara Lamb was an associate of John Mack's, she is a professional psychologist, and **she had a practice of helping people who had had these traumatic experiences... (of direct contact with extraterrestrial beings)**... and most people find that fairly traumatic... **one afternoon she came in out of her garden, and here was this reptilian guy standing in her living room**... he came towards her and said "You have been wanting to see one of us, and here I am."" - [[Daniel Sheehan]]

166. "(So I had him) give me the generals number, and give him a heads up that I would be calling... So I phoned him, and before I could even say "Hello, how are you, what's the weather...", he said "**Every word is true and more.**" Those were his opening words. And he spent 20 minutes telling me the "and more"... **the most important thing he said during that period was that there have been face to face meetings between United States officials and visitors from other star systems. Period. No equivocation.**" - [[Paul Hellyer]] 

167. When [[Laura Eisenhower]] was asked about the rumors that her great grandfather President Eisenhower had signed a treaty with extraterrestrials, she replied flatly "**It's a true story... In 1954 there was a meeting at Edwards Air Force base**... they seemed to have diplomatic intention... the treaties had to do with bartering exchanges of "planetary goods", and it was **in exchange for things like abduction**..." When asked why the extraterrestrials would like to abduct humans, she replied "**They need our DNA**. We have a treasure of DNA that is basically a living library..."

168. Dr. David Jacobs, UFO Abduction Researcher: "Many of the abductees report encounters with beings who appear to be conducting a long-term agenda. They describe hybrid beings who look almost human."

169. Dr. John E. Mack, Harvard Psychiatrist and Abduction Researcher: "Many abductees report being shown images of hybrid children or even feeling an emotional bond with them. These beings are highly interested in our genetic material and may be engaged in a project of creating a new race."  

170. "Now April 25, 1964 was the first official communication between our government and the aliens. Three saucers landed there by prearranged agreement, it was filmed by five high speed cameras, 68,000 feet of film." - [[John Lear]] 

171. [[George Knapp]]: "You believe in part that the movies E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind were not entirely just the creative products of some Hollywood director, and maybe there is more too that. Why don't you explain." 
	1. John Lear: "They were carefully guided by representatives from MJ12 who is this organization that is in charge of the coverup in order to get us ready for the release of the information that there are indeed aliens."
	2. George Knapp: "To prepare us for the idea that benevolent aliens from out space are going to help us out." 
	3. John Lear: "**Unfortunately, they are not so benevolent, so they made probably one of the most disastrous mistakes** when ET was put out, at that was before we discovered what I call "the double cross" or "the grand deception", and **they were trying to get us used to the idea of benevolent little creatures, but that isn't the case.**"

172. "There are several, actually 9, flying discs that are out there (Area 51) of extraterrestrial origin, and they are basically being dismantled... Some are being test flows... basically just being analyzed. Some are 100% in tact and operate perfectly, the other ones are being taken apart... The information is very compartmentalized... Couldn't our government have made them instead of getting them from alien beings? Totally impossible, the propulsion system is a gravity propulsion system, the power source is an anti-matter reactor, this technology does not exist at all... It is not only a crime against the American people, but against the scientific community, which I have been a part of for some time, who are actively trying to duplicate these systems, yet they are in existence now, and basically in the hands of the government. This directly taps out of the Star Wars budget... it requires huge amounts of money, and it taps out of a lot of other places too that would be very hard to track down...." - [[Bob Lazar]], Area 51 Scientist  

173. "So they went to Area 51, they got taken to S4, went down a number of flights... and they came to this area where **there was a big room with a two way mirror in it, and there was an extraterrestrial being there**... he was five and a half almost six feet tall... and he was standing there, and this guy Albert wouldn't go near him, he was just traumatized by the guy, and he... thought he was demonic... but his commander went in and was having this telepathic communication going on with him... They had been interviewing the being, voluntarily, and he was answering questions that they had. One of the questions was, "Where do you come from?" And **he said that he was part of a group of beings that were from different star systems in our galaxy**, and that they were part of a team that were going around inside the galaxy checking on places were life had begun on different planets, and they were sort of monitoring what they were doing. And they asked the follow up question, (along the lines of) "Who is in charge of that? What kind of juridical entity is there that is coordinating this kind of a thing?" And he said "you people would refer to it as "God", but it is very different than what you think." And so they specifically said they were from different star systems, and different planets inside our galaxy, and there he was. (Albert) said he didn't believe him, because he thought he was demonic." - [[Daniel Sheehan]]

174. "I don't know about the big story of where they came from, and what they are like... but certainly these crafts came from... not just another planet, but another solar system entirely, extremely far away. And they are here... The power source is an anti-matter reactor, they run gravity amplifiers, there is actually two parts to the drive mechanism. It is a bizarre technology, there is no physical hookups between any of the systems in there, they use gravity as a wave, using wave guides... the bottom of it glowed blue and began to hiss, like high voltage does on a round sphere... and then that stopped as soon as it reached twenty or thirty feet... I got to look inside and it had really small chairs, and that was I think the first confirmation I had that was just a shocking thing... why does it have little furniture inside? ...and things began to click together all too fast." - [[Bob Lazar]]

175. Side note from [[Jordan]] - a hybrid ally associated with the Pleadians  independently informed me of this same technology, where the craft essentially "surf" the wave function of gravity. He said the challenge was not traveling between star systems, but rather "the hard part is slowing down".  

176. "They threatened my life, the threatened my wife's life... guards were there with M16s, guys putting their finger into my chest and screaming in my ears, people pointing weapons at me. Like I said, it is not a good place to work." - [[Bob Lazar]]

177. "They issues involved here are so big. Huge. The American people are paying hundreds of billions of dollars (trillions according to others) for programs that they don't know anything about. And things are happening in their country that they don't know anything about. And they should know, because the United States forces... sort of operate with a 'shoot first and ask questions after' mentality... and **heaven knows what they could get us into if they start shooting at these things. They could get us into an intergalactic war, and that would be probably game over for us**." - [[Paul Hellyer]]

178. [[Jordan]]: We know from many other whistleblowers that Paul's fear were founded, and that the retrieval and reverse engineering programs revealed to US Congress are not merely passive. They are not waiting around for craft to crash, they are actively taking them down. 

179. "...Primarily in communications... and in interpretations of the language, interpretations of the heiroglyphics... at Douglas I sort of got involved in a different manner... with extraterrestrials. So I was addressing some of the things that I had been involved in the Navy, which were heavily involved in **the Germans being supported by Reptilian extraterrestrials before World War II, and during World War II**." - [[William Tompkins]] 

180. A History channel program brought forth an interesting corroboration of these hieroglyphics:  
	1. NARRATOR: Rumors of **extraterrestrial activity in Antarctica** have circulated for years. If these accounts are true and there is, in fact, an extraterrestrial presence in Antarctica today, could it have been there for hundreds or even thousands of years? In July 2018, Linda Moulton Howe interviewed a whistleblower who offered to provide her with classified information regarding Antarctica on the condition that she not reveal his identity. Her source, a retired Navy SEAL who she identifies as Spartan 1, provided her with details of an ancient structure he claims to have visited during his time at the South Pole. 
	2. SPARTAN 1: At that time, my rank was first lieutenant commander of Naval Special Operations. We were inbound to southeast coast of Antarctica. We were dispatched for - unofficially, it was a research reconnaissance mission. Officially, it was to find a certain individual, obtain any information, and bring it back. 
	3. LINDA MOULTON HOWE: What was the date?
	4. SPARTAN 1: August of 2003.
	5. NARRATOR: According to Spartan 1, when he and his team reached their destination, they encountered a large octagonal structure protruding from the ice. Cautiously, they proceeded to enter it.
	6. SPARTAN 1: At the very top of the first structure that we entered, there was almost 18 feet poking from the ice. The rest of it was hidden under the ice. Each door was the same, anywhere from 18 feet thick to around 30 feet thick. And even though these doors were that thick and that heavy, you could take one finger and push them and they would open. There was no resistance whatsoever. The outside temperature was at least 40 degrees below zero. Once you stepped inside these structures, the temperature was an ambient 68 to 72 degrees. **It was lighted from the inside, but we could not find the source of light. It was a lime green in color. The walls were lined with what I call hieroglyphics**, but nothing of hieroglyphics that I've ever seen in my life. 
	7. NARRATOR: Buried underneath the ice in Antarctica could well be stone temple constructions. There could be biological material, remains of beings that lived there and could still be there. It could be the greatest reveal in all of human history." 

181. [[Daniel Sheehan]] also personally viewed and traced the **hieroglyphics** on a photograph of an extraterrestrial craft that he viewed in the classified portions of the Project Bluebook Archives, which he gained access to in association with his work for Congress under President Carter. 

182. [[Jordan]]: Above three unconnected sources attest to various hieroglyphic languages on the craft, advanced tools and technologies, and underground bases of various extraterrestrial groups, including the Reptilians. As we research unbelievable things, we often try to "triangulate" evidence with at least three apparently unrelated sources / observations. 

183. Captain Ray Bowyer, British Commercial Airline Pilot: "I saw a craft unlike anything I had ever seen before, hovering over the English Channel. It was a bright light with an unearthly intensity, and it was not ours."  

184. [[Jeremy Corbell]] regarding [[Immaculate Constellation]]: "Right now this is what I can say: Michael Shellenberger got it right. What he reported is 100% accurate." (Regarding the Immaculate Constellation program revealed by a whistleblower, and corroborated by multiple other sources, in and leading up to October 2024.) 
	1. George Knapp: "...this Immaculate Constellation... uses a lot of different kinds of platforms to collect UFO, USO, UAP type imagery, and collates it into one place." 
	2. Jeremy Corbell: "One of the primary missions of this program would be to acquire, both actively and passively, (inputs) from all sensor platforms in all domains... satellites, to underwater sensors, to land based sensors, to aerial sensors, to space-based sensors... basically capturing UAP... that is known not to be from any technologically nation on Earth... which people call NHI - Non Human Intelligence. And the program was to acquire imagery of how other nations may have reverse engineered, from NHI technology, human technology."
	3. George Knapp: "This program is a USAP - an Unacknowledged Special Access Program." 
	4. Jeremy Corbell: "Michael Shellenberger said that members of congress had been made aware. That is 100% true and I can testify to it under oath in the court of law because I was f&%#@$# there."
	5. Jeremy Corbell: "From the very get go, we have been in the know that **we have been trying to exploit derivative technologies of UAP**."  
	6. Jeremy Corbell: "Everyone is looking for David Grusch to speak outside his DOPSR (Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review) or his pre-publication agreement..."
	7. "Right now it is very real, and people don't understand that. There is a program the government has hid from Senate, from Congress, from the gang of eight, it is called Immaculate Constellation, and by the... way, **that is just the top of the pyramid, a piece of the pie chart. There is more up there, and there are a *lot* of "constellations" below**... That (Immaculate Constellation) is a tiny thing, we are just talking about it right now because it is public, but there is a much bigger story to tell..." 

185. [[Jordan]]: This is important to note, that as this wave of "whistleblowers" comes forward and begins testifying to Congress and in public, including Chris Mellon, David Grusch, Lou Elizondo, Tim Gallaudet, David Fravor, etc., they are still bound to the military and government approval processes regarding what they can and can not publicly disclose. 

186. [[Daniel Sheehan]] explains: 
	1. "There is a lot going on behind the scenes... one of the things that people who have worked in Washington DC for 20 years or more realize is that **the public hearings that take place in congress are kind of dog and pony shows... and that they are semi-scripted as a rule... there is a decision made on high as to what is going to get said publicly and what isn't, what questions are going to get asked and what aren't... and so there is bit a of theater involved, more than a bit of theater involved**, and what is going on in the background is the real deal making. And the challenge in Washington DC, among many others, is that everything is a deal."
	2. "It is not a matter of principle, it is not a matter of what the program needs, it is a question of the kind of false dialectic that is going on. Now we have come into the scene with the UFO phenomena... the one everyone knows about... is the December 17, 2017 front page story in the New York Times, Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon, and Chris Mellon, very importantly, was the deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, both under the Clinton... and W Bush administration... and Lou Elizondo was involved in the program that the Pentagon had, a secret program, above top secret... where they were attempting to develop... an advanced weapons system using the technology they recovered from UFO craft... The thing that people don't realize, is that there was this big hubub with the front page story in the New York Times, and everyone is saying "oh here is two amazing whistleblowers coming out of the shadows, and they have come forward, and they have made this extraordinary set of revelations about the existence of this secret program, and it turns out the whole thing was authorized... that the United States Defense Department Office of Prepublication Security Review... had cleared all of those videos to be shown, and had ok'd the New York Times to publish them, so there is this whole back story going on, that there is a pretense of an insurrectionist kind of whistleblower group coming forward to reveal this information and challenge the deep secrets of the state... but in fact there is decisions being made deeper in to reveal... The bottom line is that for some reason, which we can explore, there has been a decision made at the very end of 2017, to come forward, to begin a process of trying to establish control, literally, over the disclosure of the UFO information. And it actually generated an extraordinary piece of legislation that the United States approved, which was **a 64 page bill** that set up this complex process of undertaking a "Controlled Disclosure", and actually formulating a controlled disclosure campaign to go over a 7 year to start rolling out information into the public about what it is that the United States Government knew about the UFO phenomenon, and about some vaguely identified Non Human Intelligence." 

187. "After Unacknowledged... came out in 2017... it hit about 750 million people viewing it... they then stood up an operation from a counter-intelligence expert out of the Pentagon, [[Luis Elizondo]]... Elizondo and that crowd stood up and started saying "Yea, there is something out there, and here is this footage, but we don't know what they are." Ironically, the footage they were showing were objects from the Lockheed Skunkworks... I know who worked on them, I know where they are deployed from... I have a photo of the underground entry port for those out in the Mojave desert... We know where all the sites are, my list now has 145 facilities. We do know what they are. So that is a big lie that we do not know what these are. There are two types of UFOs. Man made, that are electrogravitic anti-gravs... the date that breakthrough happened, where we had a stable anti-grav system, was October 1954. Not 64. Not 94. Now the extraterrestrial vehicles are very different, although they move in a similar way and can be confused. So there are two things that are being confused as one thing - there are both man made and extraterrestrial UAPs." - [[Stephen Greer]]  

188. "The second big lie... is that we don't know how these operate. That is what they want everyone to believe, because if they were ackowledged that we know how these function, we would be going "then what are we doing making solar panels and wind mills?" When we have something that would be a (small box) that could run this whole building 24 hours a day rain or shine, wind or no wind. So that is what this new documentary The Lost Century and How to Reclaim it is about. It is in the interest of the war-mongering psychopaths and sociopaths to convince the world population that there is a threat from "out there", because that is how you unite the whole world. Regan... had a team of people, I knew the head of that team... sent in to convince Reagan of a threat like this to get funding for SDI, the Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative. One of the reasons Regan at the United Nations said "wouldn't our job of creating world unity be easier if we had a common alien threat to unite against?" I don't think he was a bad man, I think he had false information given to him. Which is the big risk right now with disclosure... these same operators, going and providing portfolios of false information to the Congress and to the White House, and to the media and to the people. We know that is already happening. If this goes sideways, they are going to take the disclosure of this subject and flip into a war of the world, Independence Day the movie thing... and create global chaos, and create a situation to unite the world. (Von Braun) wrote on his deathbed that they would hoax an alien threat... and that was the plan they had come up with in the 50s. So we are now 70 years into this long term plan..." - [[Stephen Greer]]    

189. George Knapp: "Elon Musk came out this week... and told Tucker Carlson, "All these UFOs are advanced secret US technology." ... Elon should know, right? It seemed like gaslighting to me... I would just put it this way... giving him the benefit of the doubt. Let's put him in the category of... he has billions of dollars worth of contracts with the Department of Defense, with NASA... let's say he is on par with an Admiral Wilson, and **he knows stuff, and *is required* to lie about it.**" 

190. "So MAJI, or MAJIC if you put the committee on it, the Majority Joint Intelligence group, is one of the key groups... it is incredibly deep cover, and it is not just US. What you have to understand about this is that it is global and transnational. I don't call it international, international would connote one government to another. This is transnational. So it is very deep, covert, and it is very powerful. So you not only have the kind of wealth this organization has, but they also have technologies that could put to shame anything that 99% of generals at the Pentagon know about in their kit... and this is a big national security threat... an organization like that... with no morals or ethics, and no regard for the law, with that kind of technology and power, is an existential threat to Earth... and unfortunately to this date no President and no member of Congress has had the courage to go full bore overt after them, and **this is why this whole matter may be taken out of the hands of the politicians fairly soon.**" - [[Stephen Greer]]  

191. "We are not alone." - Everyone involved 

192. "**The technology we faced was far superior to anything that we had**." - Commander David Fravor, in sworn testimony to US Congress. 

193. "I realized holy cow... lots of these things were in the air space, they were interfering with operations... you can hear the pilot say "there is a whole fleet of them"... there were a lot, and the pilots were seeing them all the time. What gets me is that commanders like me, Admirals who are responsible for the wellbeing and safety of their people and their forces, they were forced to turn a blind eye because of some over-classification issue, and make the pilots mitigate the safety threat on their own, which is feckless to me. We need to be stepping up as flags, as leaders, and saying "alright, let's address this. Let's talk about it at the four star meeting and make sure we don't... see pilots fall out of the sky because of interactions with these things..." So that is why I have come out..." - [[Timothy Gallaudet]]

194. "A lot of people are familiar with the Air Force program called the Fast Walker program, which is a program started by the Air Force to, among other things, detect UFOs. That is a fact. There was some information that was released publicly about a similar program that the Navy had... I can't talk about it because I don't have approval to talk about it, but obviously they are interested... if there is anything underwater that can perform beyond anything we have. I remember speaking to one individual who pulled me aside and said "Lou, we were tracking this thing, and I won't say the speed, but doing hundreds and hundreds of knots (per hour) underwater, and it was bigger than our own submarine." And you know how big our submarines are, right? They are huge." - [[Louis Elizondo]]
	1. [[Jordan]]: For example, Ohio and Columbia class submarines are over 560' in length. 

195. "An individual was a helo pilot in the late 90s in the Caribbean, and they were doing missile recovery. So the Navy would test fire missiles, they would run out of fuel, they would hit the water and sink, and at a predetermined time they pop to the surface, we grab it with a helicopter, bring it back to shore, and we test it... so they are out there in the helicopter, frogman hanging down the line, you have the helo pilot, the crew chief, and the co-pilot all looking down at the bubble... and as they are about to grab this cruise missile out of the ocean, something huge and round and what was described to me as "black as a devil" starts to rise to the surface. The water begins to churn, very much like [[David Fravor]]'s description of the tic tak incident... the frogman is totally panicked and trying to climb back up... and by the way this thing is the size of a small island, and round... right as this thing is about to break the surface, it sucks the missile down, and disappears. [[David Fravor]] could probably tell you the story a little better than I can... but when you compare that to a couple other things, you have to say "hmmmmmm..."" - [[Louis Elizondo]]  

196. "We know we see them in the water too, the last example I saw was from the USS Omaha in Southern California, a well known video... and there are other examples too, classified examples I can't talk about, but confirmation that we see these things underwater. I can tell a story about a submarine officer who came out to me... but so we know they are in the water, and that is my thing. I have done a whole career of ocean science. Now I am on two bodies that advise on ocean research and I am trying to get UAP studies into their research priorities. One reports to the White House, and one reports to the National Academies... We are never going to have a full understanding... of the nature of UAP unless we look in the water too." - [[Timothy Gallaudet]]  

197. "I get this email on the Navy's secret network, SIPRNet, and it is from my boss's operation officer, I was reporting a four star admiral... and the email was sent to all the subordinate commanders, at least twenty flags and SESs, all the deputies are copied on it, and the title is "URGENT SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE", all caps. The body of the email said "If any of you know what these are, tell me ASAP. We are having numerous mid-air near collisions, and if we don't stop it we are going to have to cancel the exercise." And attached to the email was the now-famous leaked "Go Fast" video. F18 pilots captured video of this UAP zorching over the water, there are no flight control surfaces or propulsion means that are visible..." - [[Timothy Gallaudet]]  

198. "A submariner came to me and he just said, "Hey, I was on a sub in the 80s and I would like to talk to you about what I saw." And this guy is, like most nuclear submariners I know, he is just the facts. They get a passive hit, then a contact, and then it started closing on them rapidly. That was every feature that a Russian torpedo would have in terms of constant bearing, decreasing range, at a very rapid rate. And they were so convinced, they called the captain of the bridge, they set general quarters, and they dived..." - [[Timothy Gallaudet]] 

199. "The Air Force did that (deception) intentionally. The main perpetrator was a guy named Richard Doty... I can see that happening now. They are obviously obfuscating, they are deliberately not saying what they know, and saying things that are patently untrue." - [[Timothy Gallaudet]] 
  

65. [[George Knapp]]: "We met (in Russia) with this guy [[Boris Sokolov]] who had been the head of what was then the largest UFO investigation conducted by a government in the history of the world. There was a period of 78 to 88 where the Russians had these dramatic UFO incidents, and they decided to create a program to get to the bottom of it... I won't explain how I got access to the files, but I did, thousands of pages from the Russian Ministry of Defense... so then we had the problem of how to get it out. That was pretty tricky. If they had caught me I would still be there in a gulag somewhere, but they didn't. And the goal was maybe we will find out more from the Russians about what our government knows about UFOs, than we will ever learn from our government itself. And it was true. We did. I asked Sokolov "What is is the interest? What are you guys trying to do here." And he said "It is really simple. **These craft can do things that we can't. They fly circles around our best aircraft, we know they do the same thing to you.** And we figured that if we could find one and figure out how they work we could kick your ass..." I interviewed this guy named Maltsev (spelling) who had been commander of the entire Russian air forces and he told me about these encounters that Sokolov had recounted. Forty different incidents where Russian war planes chased UFOs and boom they were gone. In three of those cases though, the Russian planes war planes crashed, two of the pilots died, and after that... Maltsev issued an order 'leave them the hell alone, because "they have incredible capacities for retaliation."'"

66. "We are in a competition with our adversaries to understand this. It is a multi-decade cold war that has been under our nose for so long... I think the obtuse secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where a country might make a breakthrough... and it is so destabilizing..." - [[David Grusch]]

67. "It was a journey that opened my eyes to a lot more, because here I am thinking that my event was something more specific, but come to find out I am just a cog in the wheel of this whole big thing... and I am also confirming these (other) guy's stories to a degree. The corruption, secret organizations that have some pull in this... the nasty stuff they are doing... I am hoping it can get people to actually do something about it and not be afraid of it like I was. It was 14 years. A lot of weight to carry to try to sweep it under. I want other people who have witnessed certain things, or are a part of certain things that are very controversial... to come out and understand that what is going on is not acceptable... This technology (can) help benefit humanity as a whole... to help humanity because now everybody is going to be on the same level technology wise. My event had nothing to do with ETs. The technology may have come from ETs... and that is what we witnessed, but we witnessed much more of a sinister plot with this that they are using it (for)..."
68. "I took videos and pictures of this thing. I had taken pictures of the chaos going on behind...the rubble, burning buildings, flooding and all that... and I turn around... and there is a clearing... with a UAP sitting there, hovering, and rotating clockwise... And all of a sudden we were enveloped by this military force that to this day I don't know who they are... the way these guys moved was so fluid... very very smooth... these guys had done it for a while. They started yelling at us... using the kind of lingo we use in the military... American dialects... said they were going to smoke us, throw us out of a helicopter, very easy to get the lost in the jungle... kept saying stuff like that... They knew where our military IDs were... had (highly advanced devices), looked like modern day smart phone (but in 2009)... took pictures of our military IDs... that is when we started seeing... uparmored F350 trucks... matte black... they had weapon cases in the back of each truck bed... and they had a shipping container... with a cylinder on top of it... oxygen supply... come to find out... **it was not drugs they were putting in these shipping containers... it was humans.** They use natural disasters where people are going to be missing anyway... the craft itself was an octagonal shape... some kind of an octagonal scale pattern on it... 300', about the size of a football field... Lockheed has circular craft... Raytheon has triangular craft... might have been Lockheed... (after the trucks load) the platform raises off the ground by itself, doesn't make any noise, doesn't disturb anything... lifts up and goes into the bottom of the craft. As that happen, (the craft) starts to rise up above the tree line... the rotation has not changed, the audible hum has not changed... as soon as it got to the top of the tree line... this thing shot off... didn't make a sonic boom, like you would see a fighter jet do... didn't disturb any of the trees, like rotor wash would do on a helo or jet... I like aircraft... I know everything we've got, I know everything about 'em." - [[Michael Herrera]], US Marine

69. "We have a Marine, Michael Herrera, and his platoon came across one of these gigantic, about 300' diameter, man-made UFOs... and there were crates... he first thought they were drugs... we later learned from other sources that those were people in there, being put into slavery, to be used in experimentation... children, women, specific ones to be used... these rogue operations are a serious problem..." -  [[Stephen Greer]] 

70. "When you go back, 70 years ago, it was Truman, and Eisenhower, and Winston Churchill, we know that from some documents now. They had made an agreement... Churchill said to Eisenhower after a disc had done rings around a RAF fighter that was coming back, apparently from the German France border, and Churchill said, "This is something that we must keep from the world public for 50 years, or stock markets will crash, religions will flounder, and we will lose civilization. And in World War II years, with Adolf Hitler having said he was going to populate with all tall Aryan blondes with blue eyes, and that he set about to annihilate another group of people that were considered to be enemies of these blondes, **the underbelly of World War II for Adolf Hitler always had a tincture of something from outer space, something extraterrestrial, weapons, a huge weapon that could annihilate the world**, and it was in that mix that our counterintelligence in the UK, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the allies of World War II, were honing their skills in how to keep the public and the media away from what they knew was possibly an existential threat, and if not an existential threat it was going to be so revolutionary that the leaders at the time could lose control of the planet." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]    

71. An example of one of the multiple whistleblower sources regarding Antarctica: 
	1. "I know for a fact, based on my own first hand observations in special forces, we have **a huge archeological site in Antarctica, it is 1.5 miles under the ice**, we get to it in a submarine, and for 15 years we have been on tasks to remove artifacts they want to sanitize before they open it up to the world. What right does any human element have to deny all the rest of us knowing what is under 1.5 miles of ice, that has been there somewhere between thirteen and thirty million years. 
	2. And I know for a fact, because this has been part of our mission, that on the backside of the moon and the interior of the moon... there are artifacts that have hieroglyphics and symbols that match Antarctica. 
	3. And we know from other operations that in Sidonia in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars are hieroglyphs and symbols there that match the moon and Antarctica. 
		1. [[Jordan]]: Note that [[Haim Eshed]] and [[William Tompkins]] also confirmed bases on Mars. 
	4. And your every breath is being tracked by the [[Men In Black]]. 
	5.  Former Marine and Special Forces whistleblower via Linda Moulton Howe 

72. "I took that to a retired Navy Captain who helps me on many many things, he is very trustworthy, and I said what do you suppose... that means, that my every breath, they are tracking. And he said "Well you know, I understand that **we are now monitoring human brain signals from satellites**, so Linda, they probably have a program, you have a unique brain pattern, everybody does, and they probably tune into you, and they when you are asleep, when you are awake, where you are... they don't care about cell phones, they don't care about equipment, they can track your brain waves." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]] 

73. Colm: I think everybody is aware of this, of the Air Force office of special investigation, having people out there um trying to dissuade witnesses from talking to the media, um threatening them...  I think there's this this multiple arenas of [[Men In Black]], all of which are sort of mutually supportive in driving paranoia witnesses and in the field in general.
74. ..a lot of these are multiple agendas for different reasons, and some of them are mimicking the Real Men In Black, some of them are the Real Men In Black... I would class it as another example of what I call bidirectional mimicry. 
75. I think there is enough evidence in the literature to indicate that [[The Phenomenon]] may be associated with some cases of what we call [[Men In Black]]... there's government agents that are also at the same time in parallel working on intimidating Witnesses... 
76. ...there's enough data in the literature especially if you go back all the way to the 1950s to corroborate that statement, even in the 1800s there there was a phenomenon like that. 

77. Jordan: [[Credo Mutwa]] also testified to the experience of nearly all African tribes with (what we call) the [[Men In Black]]... 

78. "Overseeing the US government's military programs to directly link human brains and computers is the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) which says its goal is "to develop an implantable system able to provide precision communication between the brain and the digital world". - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]

79. [[Jordan]]: Note that just as [[Daniel Sheehan]] pointed out that **ongoing programs at SpaceX etc. are front operations to conceal how these extraterrestrial technologies really work**, I have seen intel briefings indicating that the US military is way ahead for instance what Neuralink is publicly doing, in terms of wirelessly linking to and controlling minds, even before the true psychic alien technologies they are trading human lives for. Note that the extraterrestrial craft are technologies are often controlled directly by the minds of the extraterrestrials.  
	1. "It is consciousness that pilots the craft." - [[Daniel Sheehan]] 

80. "As afraid as Elon Musk says he is about the risk that weaponized Artificial Intelligence could be to humankind, he is enthusiastic about developing artificial intelligence for what he calls "human enhancement", and he is founder of a company called Neuralink. The research there is to link the brain to a machine interface by creating micron sized devices that can do **human genetic engineering at the nanotech level**, to repair damaged brain and body parts, and to provide technological enhancement such as enhanced memory, enhanced communication, enhanced senses, multi-dimensional thinking, and extending the human body's lifetime... (the question) is how we live and go forward on a planet where every great idea can be militarized... and (where we are being led into a future) where we are post-human cyborgs. A cyborg is a being with both bio and mechanical body parts... A new version of human cyborgs would actually be much better for space travel than frail homo sapiens sapiens... The ultimate irony would be if humanity on Earth sets about to create space traveling cyborgs that are supposed to work for humans, but instead become a self-perpetuating force that replaces humans. That is Elon Musk's implication when he warns that AI weaponization of robots poses and existential threat to all life on Earth, and he does think that we only have four years to get on top of this." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]   

81. "In 2017, 30 governors gathered to hear Elon Musk talk about tech and the future. Musk issued a warning that he has been making for some time, that the development of robots, androids, and cyborgs with human like artificial intelligence is "a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization." He said "I have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned about it. I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people they don't know how to react because it seems so etherial... AI is a fundamental existential risk to the existence of human civilization, and I don't know if people fully appreciate that." - Elon Musk. 

82. "One of the possible future human enhancement technologies that sticks out in relationship to the human abduction syndrome connected to alien intelligences and their interactions with home sapiens on Earth is called "mind uploading"... Based on my investigations of human abductees... I have listened to many people who talk about having their mind taken out by an alien being, and then put back with added information."  - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]

83. [[Jordan]]: Note parallels to scenes in the Matrix, Star Wars, Inception, etc. 

84. [[Jordan]]: Note that autonomous, weaponized, robots are already in existence in various warzones, making independent, automated, algorithmic decisions on wether and who to kill, and that at the deep levels of the Kontrolle Structure the decision makers are non-human, and in cases intensely anti-human. 

85. "For those who are new and may not understand what the reference to [[MJ12]] / [[MAJESTIC-12]] is, there is an organization that has been defined in a lot of leaked documents... the group was organized in September 1947 by Harry S Truman after the July 1947 Roswell and several other crashes as a secret committee of scientists, military leaders, businessmen, and government officials... under a classified executive order... to monitor and analyze the interactions of non-human intelligences with Earth, and to organize back-engineering of advanced ET technologies retrieved from downed ET craft." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]] 

86. "Mr. President, we have a Trantaloid, but it is dead. We captured it in 1961 in Canada and we had it in captivity until 1962 when it died." - SERPO 27a Release (The Trantaloids may be from Epsilon Eridani)

87. The Tau Cetians - (Tau Ceti) - humanoids that look like Irishmen... - Linda 
	1. "... the Tau Cetian who worked with Drake, at Cornell University, who worked with Carl Sagan... The Tau Cetian who our government had... experimented with..." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]  
	2. Jordan: 
		1. Frank Drake was an astronomer who pioneered the field of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). 
		2. Note that on Project Ozma "The receiver was tuned to wavelengths near 21 cm, which is the wavelength of radiation emitted naturally by interstellar hydrogen; it was thought that this would be familiar, as a kind of universal standard, to anyone attempting interstellar radio communication."
		3. For whatever it is worth, I have heard this theory validated by others that interstellar hydrogen is used by some species / civilizations for this purpose, and there are structures on Earth designed to transmit in this manner. 

88. Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2... Heavy duty trade routes going between Zeta R 1 and 2 and these other star systems... with exploratory research to Earth... - Betty Hill 

89. **Many races of aliens are cloning many other races of aliens**... The archquloid is likely a cloned biological entity (CBE) created by the Ebens. The Quadloids were also cloned from two other speies of praying mantis and lizards... - SERPO 27a

90. Presentation and photographs associated archquloid cloned biological entity with vertical pupil eyes (like snake or cat), holding "communication device" (stick with serpent), at White Sand Trinity Site, 6AM April 25, 1964, in meeting with American Military and scientist. Archquloid stood back while EBENs interacted with US representatives. Allegedly (the US government) gave them back bodies in exchange for technology. In association with an HBO project, Linda was shown a briefing paper at Kirtland Air Force Base about April 25, 1964 meeting between the US Government and the EBENs. Source of the sketch is Alan Sandler and [[Robert Emenegger]] who wrote and produced the documentary and book in 1974 entitled "UFOs, Past, Present, and Future". [[Robert Emenegger]] later personally told Linda face to face that the illustration (also cited by John Lear) was sketched in his presence directly from a 16mm film frame... delivered from the Pentagon, under the orders of General Winebrenner? and that they were expecting to be able to use and show the landing footage of the one craft down, two above in an offensive / defensive pattern... and at the last minute... the Pentagon pulled that film like they pull so many others.
	1. [[Jordan]]: Note the striking similarities, or exact match, between the [[Archquloids]] video recorded in 1964, and the representations of the "rulers" from ancient Egypt, Sumer, etc. 

91. A sketch by a Navy quartermaster based in Oahu, Hawaii, in 1972 of the same CBE (Cloned Biological Entity) matches the description. 5.5' tall [[Archquloids]]. 
	1. Likely made by the EBENs with Rapid Cycle Cloning. 

92. Name "archquloid" probably relates to "archon" meaning "ruler or lord". Sumerian sun "god" Shamash in ropey headdress with rod in Mesopotamia were Archquloid related, according to government whistleblowers. Coiled rod in Sumerian texts also described as communication device. Implication is that rods in Sumerian and Egyptian texts were used by archquloids to communicate with, manage, and control the homo sapeins... created by manipulation of DNA... in already evolving primates... to produce workers for Mesopotamia ruled by off-world overlords. But (homo sapiens) were deliberately kept ignorant of the bigger picture. Government insiders ran scared when they realized that the ancient Mesopotamian overlords were actually some form of archquloids made by the EBENs that humans have worshipped as Sumerian or Annunaki gods. How ironic that the EBENs made the archquloids... and then the EBENs and archquloids made homo sapiens, who ended up worshipping (them). The Reagan briefing (in SERPO 27a) introduces the US President to the big picture of the EBENs using Rapid Cycle Cloning to genetically create, whether you want to call them androids, organic robots, clones, the big-nosed archquloids and the four-fingered quadloids, these were made by the EBENs according to this briefing.  - [[Linda Moulton Howe]]   

93. "I wonder what President Reagan said privately to his old friend CIA director Casey, about **the revelation that ETs manipulated DNA in already evolving primates to create *various models of homo sapiens* that have been subjects of an EBEN social experiment for thousands of years**...
	1. ...And that could explain why Earth has been such a haunted planet... with so many mysterious phenomena, and why power structures have always ruled with secrecy. In their experimentation it might be vital to keep humans in the dark about **what we really are, why we are**, and if our destiny is to ultimately thrive and spread out through the solar system, the milky way galaxy, and beyond, in allyship with (the [[Helpful Extraterrestrials]])... 
	2. ...but what about the [[Hostile Extraterrestrials]]? There is one startling answer in the Reagan briefing... when Advisor #4 talks about the technology of the dangerous [[Trantaloids]]... "Mr. President the trantaloid technology is probably 1,000 years more advanced than ours... strange materials... nothing like on Earth... Space tunnels... using something like matter versus anti-matter... these trantaloids can imitate humans. They can look like blond humans, however they are not blond, but ugly looking insects. They can imitate looking like humans. They have the ability to change their bodies. So which tall or short blond nordics might be used as camouflage for trantaloids that President Reagan was told were actually dangerous insects... from Epsilon Eridani? 
	3. Or **are "we" somebody's androids? There is no way of getting around that as a fact.** That is why the government of the United States does not want any of us to know. **Are some of the blondes and red hairs of history actually another species** trying to help android humanity, such as archangel Michael, who historically has fought off dragons and serpents? 
	4. I have been told by a Washington DC based whistleblower that MJ12 evolved to a different code that began E2, perhaps related to an alleged black budget related military organization... called E2SCD - the **Extraterrestrial Space Command Directorate**. Does it exist in those letters and numbers today? Probably not. Part of the success of intel and counterintel is like a shell game... 
	5. **My Washington military source told me that the EBENs who made us and put us here watch us live and grow**... the EBENs have been here since before the beginning of the dinosaurs... I asked him what happened that caused the almost total annhiliation of earth-life including the dinosaurs almost 65 million years ago... and he said "I read in the Yellow Book" (an EBEN holographic book (I have talked with two or three people who have handled it... you can look through the history of our solar system... like Princess Lea in Star Wars)... that the EBENs knew back 65 million years ago that a very large asteroid was going to hit the Earth. The EBENs wrote that they were saving one of each species that was on this planet... before the asteroid hit... (but they chose not to avert the asteroid despite being capable of doing so)...  
	6. ...(we have) a prime intelligence... that genetically made with Rapid Cycle Cloning the next two ET species on that list of five, and that means those two, the archquloids and quadloids, would be equivalent to AI androids made to do service for the EBENs. 
	7. And then allegedly what do the EBENs do according to the Presidential briefing? The EBENs put the archquloids out in the Milky Way galaxy, including the probability that the big nosed archuloids with the elongated heads and the ropey headdresses had something to do with the Annunaki and the Sumerians on Earth... 
	8. and then the EBENs used the quadloid preying mantis lizard hybrids to be scientific overseers, of many other planetary life seeding projects.... 
		1. [[Jordan]]: This matches the face to face experiences of abductees, who often cite the presence of preying mantis or reptilian creatures in conjunction with the tall and short greys. 
		2. Because we are dealing with a diversity of alien species and civilizations, there are a variety of experiences. 
	9. ...And now in the 21st century, without yet being publicly introduced to our alien... makers, we ourselves are now creating other intelligences to be soldiers, truck drivers, cooks, house keepers... Human scientists have now produced the first primate clones (and now human clones)... 
	10. Maybe we should realize that genetic manipulation to make androids, clones, hybrids, and cyborgs has long been the EBEN process for distributing their civilization's intelligences and geopolitical control to other planets, solar systems, and galaxies." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]], citing Washington / intelligence source

94. "There was a very important crash retrieval, 6 years before Roswell, and I have no doubt about this, and that was in Cape Giradeau, Missouri. Date April 1941, discussed in leaked Majestic 12 documents, from which a neutronic propulsion device was retrieved and delivered later to Robert Oppenheimer when he began work... to produce the first atomic bomb." - [[Linda Moulton Howe]] 

95. "The far horizon is that we are going to make it through this, in fits and starts, and we are going to have a new civilization begin on this planet, the hallmark of which is a peaceful planet on Earth, living peacefully with these other planets. To get from criticality now to that point is going to be a *very* heavy lift. (This) pulled me out of my work as an emergency doctor because I realized that we are in a global emergency, and that is why I left medicine. The cosmic false flag that I want to talk about is the crown jewel of the secrecy that was hatched in the 50s, that led to Eisenhower losing control of these programs. And no President since that time has had full operational control over these rogue elements. So now we are in a period where these operations have run amok, so much so that it has become an existential threat to life on Earth." - Stephen Greer  

This is just a small sampling of thousands of credible government, military, law enforcement, and civilian witnesses who are now on the record, revealing the decades, centuries, and millennia of deceit of the human population.
