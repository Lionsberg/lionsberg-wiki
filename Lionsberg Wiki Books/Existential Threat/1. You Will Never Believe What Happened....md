# 1. You Will Never Believe What Happened...

"It is almost impossible to convince someone of something they do not want to be true." - anonymous 

Words cannot convey how profound the implications are if what this Story reveals is True. 

I experienced it for my Self, and desperately did not want to believe my eyes and ears. 

I am concerned that what follows is so shocking, so disorienting, and so contrary to everything We were taught about the world We thought We were living in, that no one will be able to believe it until they experience it for themselves. 

I pray that is not true, because for many, by the time the talons of Evil pierce their skin, it will be too late. 

The time to discover that aliens and demons are real is not the moment when an army of them suddenly bursts into your home and grabs your children.
