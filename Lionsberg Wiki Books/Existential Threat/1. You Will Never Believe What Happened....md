# 1. You Will Never Believe What Happened...

"It is almost impossible to convince someone of something they do not want to be true." - unknown 

Words cannot convey how profound the implications of this Story are. 

If it is True, it is the most shocking Story in human history. 

If it is True, WE ARE NOT ALONE in the Universe. 

If it is True, We are facing together into the greatest Existential Threat to the human civilization and life on Earth in modern history. 

I know it is True, because I have experienced various aspects of it for my Self.

At first, I desperately did not want to believe my eyes and ears. 

And yet, I Knew. I Remembered. In the summer of 2024, the Memories came flooding back. 

I am concerned that what follows is so shocking, so disorienting, and so contrary to everything We were taught about the world We thought We were living in, that no one will be able to believe it until they experience it for themselves. 

I pray that is not true, because for many, by the time the talons of Evil pierce their skin, it will be too late. 

For many, by the time they look up and see The Tsunami, there will be no where to run. 

The time to discover that aliens, ghosts and demons are real is not the moment when an army of them suddenly bursts into your home. 

I know they are real, because I have met them.
