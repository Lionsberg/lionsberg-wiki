# 7. The Truth Shall Set Us Free

The governing philosophy of the false authorities of the Old World is that they have the right, and even the warped "moral duty", to lie, cheat, steal, torture, and kill in order to advance the interests of the Evil Empire and the institutions it dominates and puppets, such at the United States, NATO, the United Nations, the Vatican, and virtually every other religious, political, and social institution on Earth. 

All reasonably Wise, Right, and Good beings have a very different philosophy of governance, which values the Spirit within each Being as the primary locus of Sovereignty and Authority, and promotes the search for Wisdom and Truth in a Spirit of Love. 

By Truthfully telling Jordan's Story, I am attempting to catastrophically shatter the Control Structure of the Evil Empire, and expose their process of Controlled Disclosure as part and parcel to the greatest fraud and deception in human history.
