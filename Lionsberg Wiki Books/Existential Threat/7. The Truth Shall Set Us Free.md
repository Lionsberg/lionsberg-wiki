# 7. The Truth Shall Set Us Free

The governing philosophy of the illegitimate authorities of the Old World is that they have the right, and even the warped "moral duty", to lie, cheat, steal, torture, and kill in order to advance the narrow interests of their little corner of the Evil Empire. 

This include the institutions it dominates and puppets, such at the United States, NATO, the United Nations, the Vatican, and virtually every other religious, political, and social institution on Earth. 

Now We should clarify that We refer to the United States or the United Nations, We are not referring to the good people of the small communities around the world. We are not referring to the everyday citizens doing their best, going to work, going to church, helping those who suffer, struggling to make ends meet, and coaching their kid's sports teams. 

We are referring to the corrupt and illegitimate institutional structures of "governance", "economy", etc. 

All reasonably Wise, Right, and Good beings have a very different philosophy of governance, which values **The Spirit** within each Being above All as the primary locus of Sovereignty and Authority, and promotes the Shared Quest towards Wisdom and Truth in a Spirit of Power, Love, and Sound Mind. 

By Truthfully telling Jordan's Story, We are attempting to catastrophically shatter the Control Structure and Controlled Disclosure of the Evil Empire, and thereby expose the greatest fraud and deception in human history.
