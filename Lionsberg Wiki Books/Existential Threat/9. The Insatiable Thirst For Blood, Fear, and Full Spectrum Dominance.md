# 9. The Insatiable Thirst For Blood, Fear, and Full Spectrum Dominance 

The explicit aim and insatiable thirst of the Evil Empire, as seen for instance through the planning and policy documents of various factions of the United States Government, is [[Full Spectrum Dominance]] of humanity and the planet. 

It is the classic game of draconian Empire and Oligarchy, derived from an insatiable, ancient, and primal thirst for blood, fear, and dominion. 

It ancient and archetypical, stretching back beyond the foundations of the world. 

Over the coming pages as you learn that the Deepest puppet masters of the [[Visible Power Structures]] on Earth are [[Not Merely Human]], you will come to understand why and how it is that their Quest for [[Full Spectrum Dominance]] extends not only to every corner of Earth, but throughout the Galaxy and Beyond. 

The real wars are fought not within, but over star systems, worlds, and their inhabitants. 

And like it or not, you were born into a world at war. 

What current and former "authorities" around the world are now admitting is that multiple advanced civilizations of extraterrestrial species have been coming and going from Earth, and warring over it, for millennia. 

And the unholy alliance of false religious and political authorities around the Earth have intentionally and successfully concealed this Reality from the human species they are trying to keep divided, conquered, dominated, and enslaved.
