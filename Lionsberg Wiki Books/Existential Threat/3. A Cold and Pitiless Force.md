# 3. A Cold and Pitiless Force

One of the last great South African wisdom keepers perhaps said it best before he died, as he desperately tried to warn humanity: 

"But now, you are going to face something even 1,000 times more dangerous for God's sake. A pitiless force. A force of destruction and enslavement. This is what you are going to face. And you are not in your right head at all... and when I say this I speak from experience."

He knew about "it" from experience, because for generations even the mightiest warriors of the tribes of Africa had lived in fear of them. 

He knew about "it" from experience, because "it" brutally abducted, tortured, raped, and experimented upon him. 

As I have said, those of us who have experienced their talons in our flesh and felt the merciless and compassionless cold that runs through their veins first hand KNOW.  

And We can never Unknow what We have experienced. We can never Unsee what We have seen. We can never Unhear what We have heard. We can never Unsmell what We have smelled. 

The Spirit deep within you knows it too, for beneath The Veil of Our Apparent Individuation, We Are One.
