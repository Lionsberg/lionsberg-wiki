# 3. A Cold and Pitiless Force

One of the last great South African wisdom keepers perhaps said it best before he died, as he desperately tried to warn humanity: 

"But now, you are going to face something even 1,000 times more dangerous for God's sake. A pitiless force. A force of destruction and enslavement. This is what you are going to face. And you are not in your right head at all... and when I say this I speak from experience."

He knew about them from experience, because for generations even the mightiest warriors of the tribes of Africa had lived in fear of them...

...and because he personally had been brutally abducted, tortured, raped, and experimented upon by them. 

As I have said, those of us who have experienced their talons in our flesh and felt the merciless and compassionless cold that runs through their veins KNOW.  

The Spirit deep within you knows it too, for beneath The Veil of Our Apparent Individuation, We Are One.
