# 16. Jordan's Interpretation and Hypothesis

Jordan's notebooks are bursting with far more information than most would have the time or desire to try to make sense of. 

But he left Us an updated Map of Reality, as a Hypothesis that some of Us can continue to explore and improve as We venture out together Beyond The Boundary.  

The religious, political, social, and economic implications are staggering. 

If it is True, All humanity can become, within a single generation, debt-free "billionaires" co-creating Heaven On Earth. If it exercises its Free Will and chooses that Reality. 

But first, We have to help All humanity wake up from their induced comas, exit the Alien Kontrolle Structure, and find their Way to Freedom. 

In between the Alien Kontrolle Structure and Heaven On Earth lies a vast Wilderness that We will have to cross together. 

So We are in a process of waking up and remembering, together: 
- Who We Are  
- Where We Are  
- How We Got Here  
- Where We Are Going  
- And WHY  

The most shocking and disorienting part of that for humanity is going to be grappling with the Reality that [[We Are Not Alone in the Universe]], and that other civilizations and species are thousands, millions, and billions of years more technically and psychically advanced than humanity is. 

Jordan came to Know that UFOs, alien craft, and alien visitors are Real through a very unique Journey of personal, experiential learning. 

Each individual will have to go on their own Journey of discovery to explore these realms for them Selves. 

We will never be able to fully understand how Jordan came to Know this, for some kinds of Knowing are very Deep, but his hypothesis is approximately as follows: 

1. Neither the phenomena of Extraterrestrial and Ultradimensional beings, their craft and technologies, nor any other aspect of Reality can be understood without acknowledging and understanding the realms and dimensions of Spirit, Consciousness, and existence beyond the typical experience of human beings. 
2. The relationship between The Phenomenon (of UFOs, their pilots, ultradimensional beings, etc.) with Consciousness is inseparable. One aspect cannot be fully understood without the other. 

Therefore, We must begin In The Beginning, with [[One]] and [[All]].

## One and All

1. In The Beginning, the conceptual field is defined by the notions of One and All, Creator and Creation, Ultimate Reality and Reality, God and Nature, Unity and Diversity. 
2. The entire Universe is One interexistent Living System, or Body. 
3. It is a single, omni-harmonic Whole, permeated by [[One]] Ultimate Spirit and Consciousness. 

## Trinity and Co-Creation

1. Co-Creation is (at least) Triune. 
	1. **Source**: The Generative Source of the Universe is Transcendent. 
	2. **Spirit**: Spirit and Consciousness are Manifest. 
	3. **Incarnation**: A fragment of the [[One]] Ultimate Spirit and Consciousness is Incarnate in every atom, cell, and aspect of the Living System / Universe. 
2. **Ultimate Unity**: Despite their [[Apparent Individuation]] and trinity, every individual Creature is Ultimately an aspect of the [[One]].  
3. **Fractal Holographic Nature**: Because an apparent "particle" of the "wave function" of the Universal Whole permeates every atom of every Being, Creation is (something like) fractal / holographic / holonic in Nature. 

## Space and Time

Once We Understand the Ultimate Unity of All Creation, We can begin to explore its various dimensions, aspects, and realms without getting lost. 

As We begin to explore what is happening in the Narrative Universe, it is crucial to remember that SpaceTime is an illusion that manifests relative to the Energy and Consciousness of each [[Apparently Individuated]] Being. 

How We experience Space and Time is different from how "you" experience it, which is different from how a planet, mountain, rock, butterfly, ant, or lion experiences it. 

It is also different from how far more psychically and technologically advanced species and civilizations experience it.

At the Limit, the [[One]] is completely transcendent of SpaceTime. SpaceTime exists within its Creation, but the One is Beyond it, just as an Author is Beyond the SpatioTemporality of the Story they are writing. 

The more an [[Apparently Individuated]] Being transcends its own [[Apparent Individuation]] by shifting its primary Locus of Being back towards the One, the more and more it transcends [[SpaceTime]] as experienced by others of its species or "type". 

## Physical Bodies and Lifespans 

Remembering that SpaceTime is a subjective illusion that exists only relative to the [[Spacetime User Interface]] of each Being in The Game... 

We can start to grasp how it is that various beings can live for hundreds, thousands, or millions of years. 

We can also start to grasp how various [[Apparently Individuated]] aspects of One Spirit and Consciousness could co-create and inhabit multiple bodies across vast expanses of apparent Space and Time. 

It then becomes apparent that Consciousness navigating over millennia or millions of years would be interested in guiding and directing the evolutionary co-creation of its vast diversity of physical embodiments. 

## Cloning and Genetic Engineering 

When species and civilizations reach a certain level of Psychic and Technological maturity, they tend to begin co-creating other forms of Life through genetic engineering and cloning. 

In early stages, this involves the discovery of DNA, genetics, hybridization, etc., and mostly occurs organically through consciously selecting and breeding certain traits into and out of various species of plants and animals.

In later stages, it evolves to directly engineering and cloning desired forms of life. 

Human beings have now crossed through the threshold where they are genetically engineering and cloning microbes, plants, animals... and humans. 

Human beings are further experimenting with the creation of cyborg humans which compose human bodies and minds with mechanical parts and brain / machine interfaces. 

[[Jordan]] also left us a link to a presentation by a military / intelligence official essentially confirming that the military was able to remotely control human minds, and use one human mind to control the physical body of another human. 

Multiple species of advanced extraterrestrial entities, over millions of years, are genetically engineering multiple species of advanced extraterrestrial entities, who are genetically engineering multiple species of advanced extraterrestrial entities, etc., all the way down to a human species who has been systematically deceived and enslaved. 

## Where We Are

### Earth

So here We are, together aboard [[Worksite Earth]]. 

Among the trillions of planets in the Universe, Earth is an extraordinary environment that produces flourishing and abundant Life. 

For this reason, it has been used as a Living Laboratory for at least hundreds of advanced civilizations of extraterrestrial beings for millions of years. 

Recall that multiple government officials, not that We trust them, confirmed at least alien species over millions of years. 

[[Jordan]] was told at least 280 species by someone he believed. 

Some of these advanced species reside more permanently on Earth, some come and go cyclically in accordance with the movements of their star systems and planets. 

### The Alien Kontrolle Structure 

[[Jordan]] discovered that within Earth, humanity is being systematically deceived, enslaved, harvested, hybridized, and preyed upon within what Jordan called an [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]]. 

When one has ventured out Beyond the Earth and glimpsed the trillions of stars and planets, it is easy to imagine various species on various planets in various star systems enslaved in a Matrix or Alien Kontrolle Structure that they do not even know exists. 

However when one is born into an [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]], especially if it has been operating for millennia, it is nearly impossible for its inhabitants to detect. The sheep born into the lamb factory do not know that there is another Reality Beyond The Boundary. They simply are born, grow, work, reproduce, suffer, and die. 

We will explore its details in more detail later, and it will be far easier to see once We are out in The Wilderness Beyond it. 

Remember the movie The Matrix... you cannot be "told" about the [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]]. You have to see and experience it for your Self. 

## How We Got Here

Ok... this is going to be a tough pill for many to swallow, for it violates entirely the teachings of the false religious, political, and academic authorities in the [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]]. 

At the time of his death, [[Jordan]]'s best understanding was that the ancient stories and tablets were True, and that human beings were the product of neither direct Creation by the Ultimate Creator, nor random unguided evolution. 

Rather, [[Jordan]] discovered just before his death that human beings in 2024 contained DNA from the genetic engineering of at least 22 different extraterrestrial civilizations, and that the Universe was full of our distant cousins on many, many planets. 

Many of the species we encounter on the Earth are indeed the products of intelligent design, not of the Ultimate Creator, but of a diverse array of advanced creative extraterrestrial co-creators.

The human beings they co-created "in their image", as spoken in the Bible, the tablets, and the origin stories from around the world, are also creators. 

The bible refers to them as Elohim. The adjacent texts from the same area as Annunaki. 

For those deeply entrenched in any one of the warring religions of the Kontrolle Structure, all that must be done to the conceptual field is to recognize that there are many layers and dimensions between the anthropomorphic "God" that humanity has imagined in the past, and humanity it Self. 

Just as the DNA of most pets, livestock, and food humanity interacts with has been genetically modified by human intervention... 

...so too will humanity be surprised to discover that it, indeed, is the product of a vast legacy of life seeding, genetic engineering, and warring by other advanced extraterrestrial species and civilizations...

...which has been ongoing throughout the universe over billions of years (as Time was perceived by humanity in 2024). 

But remember... Time is an relative illusion. 

Earth flourished far beyond most planets. It was a grand horticultural experiment. It became like a greenhouse and laboratory for hundreds of advanced spacefaring civilizations. 

[[Jordan]] learned that somewhere around 2,500 years ago, certain advanced civilizations that were more peaceful and benevolent tired of the constant conflict with other species of lower vibrations, and pulled out from Earth. 

This *temporarily* enabled the Darker forces to pull The Veil down over human history, and dominate, manipulate, kontrolle, and prey upon humanity for two millennia. 

However The Greatest Secret is hiding in plain sight. 

Once humanity rediscovers and remembers Who We Are, Where We Are, How We Got Here, Where We Are Going, and Why...

...We can partner with forces beyond Our wildest imagination to co-create Heaven on Earth, while venturing Beyond into the infinite Cosmos. 

Once humanity digests this information... everything will make so much more sense...

...In 2024, everything felt *wrong*, because it was. 

Humanity... was awakening. 
## Where We Are Going 

Humanity is awakening, and extraterrestrial and ultradimensional forces are incarnating and returning, in order to enable humanity TO CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE. 

From Where We Are, two paths lie before Us on Earth. 

If humanity so chooses, it will remain asleep in the [[Alien Kontrolle Structure]], its population will be significantly reduced, likely down into the hundreds of millions, and the few who remain will be genetically modified by their alien / fascist captors into something that no longer resembles humanity as We once knew it. 

Very realistically, We are facing the greatest Existential Threat to human being and civilization in human history. 

In this case, some of Us who could have been helpful to humanity will mourn terribly, before venturing back out into other realms and dimensions to continue to advance The Mission. 

However what We hope is that human will awaken, arise, unite, and partner with Us and One Another to vanquish the Forces of Darkness, co-create Heaven on Earth, and advance together towards the fullness of Our Potential and Destiny. 

Embedded in The Greatest Secret is that humanity's potential is far, far beyond what has so far been revealed to it. 

The stories are True. 

In the Creation of humanity, something extraordinarily special was added, which has thus far remained mostly dormant, but is Now being invited to Emerge. 

Human beings were imbued with an extraordinary spark of the Divine. 

There is a reason all these extraterrestrial civilizations care so much about the Earth and the human species. The Greatest Secret lies in the Living Library of Our DNA. 

Between 2024 and 2026, communications and connections between various extraterrestrial civilizations and humanity will accelerate. 

By 2027, humanity will Know it is not alone. 

According to some in the US Government, "the gods" will return. 

The self-interests and agendas of a diverse array of extraterrestrial civilizations will be revealed, both within and Beyond the Galactic Federation. 

It is Time. Humanity must Consciously Decide its trajectory, a decision that will set its course for millennia, and in a strange sense, for eternity. 

If humanity would like help, We are here. For you. For this. Please ask Us.
