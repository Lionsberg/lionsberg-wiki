We will have to co-create a New Way of Loving One Another.  

We will have to co-create a New Way of singing, of dancing, of laughing, of loving, of playing.

We were made to Free.

Each and every One of Us has slightly different thoughts, words, and images burst into Mind when We ponder the vision of [[Hell On Earth]].

[[Jordan]] traveled through dozens of countries and hundreds of counties and a vast diversity of dinner tables and ceremonies to discover the Truth that when We ask Our Selves "How Would You Like The World To Be?"...
