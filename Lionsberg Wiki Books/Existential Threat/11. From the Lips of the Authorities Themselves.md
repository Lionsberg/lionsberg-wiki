# 11. From the Lips of the Authorities Themselves

Because you might not have yet experienced angels, demons, aliens, extraterrestrials, and ultra-dimensional beings for your Self...

...and because you have been taught to trust and obey the religious and political authorities... 

...I will take a moment to allow you to hear about this Reality from their lips rather than mine. 

It is a strange trap, because as We advance into Our Future, We will not be able to trust, believe, or rely on "them" in any Way. 

But nevertheless let's listen as they affirm that what Jordan discovered and experienced firsthand on his Journey is, in fact, real. 

We have confirmation of the existence of a diverse array of highly advanced non-human extraterrestrial species via the sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste of millions of government, military, and civilian witnesses, along with photos, videos, radar, and readings from the most advanced military equipment on our carrier fleets, jets, drones, and satellites, alongside the vast array of purpose-built water, land, air, and space based sensors in the "Immaculate Constellation" revealed in October 2024. 

And we have evidence going back millennia in the Bible and the records and oral traditions of nearly every indigenous tribe and tradition on Earth. 

It is Time to get over the debate on whether human beings are alone in the 

Reporter: "Why do you say that UFOs are as real as the airplanes flying over our heads?"

Response: "Well, because I know that they are, and they have been visiting this planet for **thousands of years**. And there is what is called **a federation** of these people." - Paul Hellyer - former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Deefense for Canada. 

Former Chief of Israeli Space Security Haim Eshed confirmed that there is indeed **a galactic federation**, that **multiple world leaders and governments are in communication with delegates of this galactic federation**, that **agreements have been signed** with the federation, and that there are **joint bases where extraterrestrial and humans work side by side**. Including on Mars. 

"...the headline hits, "**WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE**." It is preposterous that this is still the superimposed... "government sanctioned" point of view... We have not been introduced to any of this as a world civilization... We are still in a segmented, fragmented world when it comes to any of this information. Leaks give you hints, what we need is the whole truth and the big picture about who is interacting with us, our planet, why, and how many of our own military forces... have been going out to other solar systems since at least 1972... and the disconnect between what human beings may already be existing in other solar systems in a military way, versus a planet that has still not even been told the truth. That disconnect... has to end." - Linda Moulton Howe  

In 2023, in sworn testimony before the United States Congress, senior intelligence officer David Grusch revealed the existence of a multi-decade program to retrieve and reverse engineer alien craft and advanced technologies. He clarified under questioning that the United States was in possession of both extraterrestrial craft and "biologics". 

We know from an array of other sources that the "biologics" recovered along with the craft were both living and dead. 

Highly decorated military pilot John Lear confirmed at least 30 to 50 alien bodies back in the 1980s. 

"The question in my mind is not *what*, but *who*? I know what they are. Hynek knows what they are. The United States Government knows what they are. The Soviet government knows what they are. Everyone who has done any investigation in depth knows what they are." - Dr. Walter Martin 

"I have no doubt whatsoever, zero doubt, that there is an element inside our government structures, that is part of the intelligence community, that is part of the military, that have direct knowledge about the existence of these extraterrestrial beings that are here on the planet. The question then would be, in light of the fact that they know they are here,... that it would be almost *impossible* to believe that they hadn't made efforts to have some kind of communication with them. They aren't just going to let them sit there. They clearly would have made the effort to have communication with them. So the next question you have to ask is, is it reasonable to believe that the beings would have communicated with them? There does seem to be some kind of tacit understanding that they have about being able to coexist in some way, whereby the United States government is not just going to run out say "Hey everybody, there are beings from another star system here on our planet." So they obviously have some kind of protocol established here where they are not going to be revealing it, and the beings themselves are not just going to land in Central Park and tell everybody." - Danny Sheehan  

History Channel Narrator: "J Rod was one of the crash survivors, and worked directly with our own government. Captain Bill Uhouse, a former Navy pilot who later worked for the US Air Force performing experimental testing on aircraft, was assigned to Area 51 in the mid 1960s. He claims he not only studied the craft that crashed in Kingman Arizona, but also had direct contact with J Rod."
Bill Uhouse: "We had a long period of introduction into meeting, you know, an alien... and I called him J Rod, that was the name the linguist gave him. And he'd talk, he would talk, but if you spoke, he would sound just like you... basically it was only engineering or science advice."
Narrator: "There was also another whistleblower by the name of Dan Burish... who said he was hired as a microbiologist to basically care for J Rod, ensuring that he remained healthy, and this went on for years. According to Dan Burish and Bill Uhouse, J Rod was housed in a special underground chamber at Area 51, and there have been numerous other accounts of extraterrestrials working with the United States Government. There are a lot of stories of how we worked with the aliens at Area 51, or some say at a base nearby (referring to S4)... and we have been working with them in underground labs and they have been sharing information for us to enhance our technologies."

"All sorts of things, including the armada that flew South over Europe... of about 50 UFOs... The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe... ordered a study to be done, and it took three years. And what the study concluded was that there had been **at least four species, at least four, visiting Earth for thousands of years**. This is not a new phenomenon... and **predates what we call our modern history of the last ten or fifteen thousand years**." - Paul Hellyer 

Hundreds of military officials, including those guarding the most powerful weapons on the planet at our nuclear sites, who are on the PRP (Personal Responsibility Program) reporting if they take even an over the counter painkiller, claim to consistently see UFOs in the most restricted airspaces of the planet, that they are powerless to counteract (see UFOs and Nukes by Robert Hastings). The extraterrestrial forces often appear in disc or tic tak shaped objects, and are capable of arming and disarming our nuclear missiles at will, overriding systems, altering missile trajectories, etc. 

"The people that say this is not a repeatable thing... it is just not true... it is just that they are ignorant. I mean, the only thing worse than being ignorant, and then arrogant about it... and lot's of people are... So I have just ignored that... There is a whole other level of human people in our family who are not ignorant, that follow protocols and try to figure out what is really going on, and that is what we are talking about here. And one of most important issues that this element of our human family deals with is the UFO issue. And the reality is that it mixes in with these psychic faculties..." - Danny Sheehan

"...So even thought you have something as, dare I say prosaic, as extraterrestrial beings who have been like 2 billion years more technologically advanced than we are, and psychically advanced than we are, who have figured out how to come and go from our planet, ok, BANG... But then then is all this other stuff, all this other strange phenomenon that goes on at our planet, that exists at this other level of insight, such as the capacities of our human family. Telepathy, teleportation, astrotravel, remote viewing, transmutation of matter... but what we have done is we've culturally riveted on some of these beings from the past... it is extraordinarily important... people who gufaw at it and poke fun at it are not only ignorant, but they are arrogant! ...they are still stuck in the scientific, logical, positivist, materialist worldview. It is institutionalized at the academy and the university level, and therefore you can't get cutting edge exploration on the part of some of the better minds of our human family, they won't allow it. Philosophy, theology, any of them, you can't go there." - Danny Sheehan

"They are still, like lighting rocket fuel on fire and burning it to shoot a rocket up into space, and they are spilling billions of dollars on that, *as a front operation.* (SpaceX), etc. are totally a front for what is really known about the way that these craft really work... They ran into a major problem that they were not able to pilot the craft, because it is *consciousness* that pilots the craft."

"A woman named Karen... was furious... because she had been abducted, and after she had been returned... she found she was pregnant, and she hadn't been with anyone for over a year, and she didn't know what was going on... and she went all the way through to the end of the first trimester, and she was going to the obstetrician, and couldn't figure out what was going on, and then she gets abducted again, and she is not pregnant anymore. And she was just furious about what they were doing with her. So when they would show up again, she would actually throw things at them, throw lamps at them, kick them... So these three little dudes show up in her living room... brought her onto the craft, now totally conscious about it... and then they bring her to this other place, took her off the craft... and there was this little hybrid two year old girl... kind of stringy hair, and big eyes, but she knew instantaneously that it was her daughter..." - Daniel Sheehan 

I have had multiple men and women personally testify to me of their experiences of abductions relating to reproductive issues and medical experiementation. 

John Mack, head of Harvard's psychiatry department, wrote a book called Abduction which is a source for sampling highly credible and vetted testimonies regarding abduction experiences. 

"(So I had him) give me the generals number, and give him a heads up that I would be calling... So I phoned him, and before I could even say "Hello, how are you, what's the weather...", he said "Every word is true and more." Those were his opening words. And he spent 20 minutes telling me the "and more"... the most important thing he said during that period was that there have been face to face meetings between United States officials and visitors from other star systems. Period. No equivocation." - Paul Hellyer 

When Laura Eisenhower was asked about the rumors that her great grandfather President Eisenhower had signed a treaty with extraterrestrials, she replied flatly "It's a true story... In 1954 there was a meeting at Edwards Air Force base... they seemed to have diplomatic intention... the treaties had to do with bartering exchanges of "planetary goods", and it was in exchange for things like abduction..." When asked why the extraterrestrials would like to abduct humans, she replied "They need our DNA. We have a treasure of DNA that is basically a living library..."

"They issues involved here are so big. Huge. The American people are paying hundreds of billions of dollars (trillions according to others) for programs that they don't know anything about. And things are happening in their country that they don't know anything about. And they should know, because the United States forces... sort of operate with a 'shoot first and ask questions after' mentality... and heaven knows what they could get us into if they start shooting at these things. They could get us into an intergalactic war, and that would be probably game over for us." - Paul Hellyer

We know from many other whistleblowers that Paul's fear were founded, and that the retrieval and reverse engineering programs revealed to US Congress are not merely passive. They are not waiting around for craft to crash, they are actively taking them down. 

"...Primarily in communications... and in interpretations of the language, interpretations of the heiroglyphics... at Douglas I sort of got involved in a different manner... with extraterrestrials. So I was addressing some of the things that I had been involved in the Navy, which were heavily involved in the Germans being supported by Reptilian extraterrestrials before World War II, and during World War II." - William "Bill" Tompkins 

A History channel program brought forth an interesting corroboration of these hieroglyphics For a parallel account of hieroglyphics: 

NARRATOR: Rumors of extraterrestrial activity in Antarctica have circulated for years. If these accounts are true and there is, in fact, an extraterrestrial presence in Antarctica today, could it have been there for hundreds or even thousands of years? In July 2018, Linda Moulton Howe interviewed a whistleblower who offered to provide her with classified information regarding Antarctica on the condition that she not reveal his identity. Her source, a retired Navy SEAL who she identifies as Spartan 1, provided her with details of an ancient structure he claims to have visited during his time at the South Pole. 
SPARTAN 1: At that time, my rank was first lieutenant commander of Naval Special Operations. We were inbound to southeast coast of Antarctica. We were dispatched for - unofficially, it was a research reconnaissance mission. Officially, it was to find a certain individual, obtain any information, and bring it back. 
LINDA MOULTON HOWE: What was the date?
SPARTAN 1: August of 2003.
NARRATOR: According to Spartan 1, when he and his team reached their destination, they encountered a large octagonal structure protruding from the ice. Cautiously, they proceeded to enter it.
SPARTAN 1: At the very top of the first structure that we entered, there was almost 18 feet poking from the ice. The rest of it was hidden under the ice. Each door was the same, anywhere from 18 feet thick to around 30 feet thick. And even though these doors were that thick and that heavy, you could take one finger and push them and they would open. There was no resistance whatsoever. The outside temperature was at least 40 degrees below zero. Once you stepped inside these structures, the temperature was an ambient 68 to 72 degrees. It was lighted from the inside, but we could not find the source of light. It was a lime green in color. The walls were lined with what I call hieroglyphics, but nothing of hieroglyphics that I've ever seen in my life. 
NARRATOR: Buried underneath the ice in Antarctica could well be stone temple constructions. There could be biological material, remains of beings that lived there and could still be there. It could be the greatest reveal in all of human history." 

Danny Sheehan also personally viewed and traced the heiroglyphics on a photograph of an extraterrestrial craft that he viewed in the classified portions of the Project Bluebook Archives. 

I am providing here three brief unconnected sources attesting to various hieroglyphic languages on the craft, advanced tools and technologies, and underground bases of various extraterrestrial groups, including the Reptilians. As I research unbelievable things, I often try to "triangulate" evidence with at least three apparently unrelated sources / observations. 

Jeremy Corbell: "Right now this is what I can say: Michael Shellenberger got it right. What he reported is 100% accurate." (Regarding the Immaculate Constellation program revealed by a whistleblower, and corroborated by multiple other sources, in and leading up to October 2024.) 
George Knapp: "...this Immaculate Constellation... uses a lot of different kinds of platforms to collect UFO, USO, UAP type imagery, and collates it into one place." 
Jeremy Corbell: "One of the primary missions of this program would be to acquire, both actively and passively, (inputs) from all sensor platforms in all domains... satellites, to underwater sensors, to land based sensors, to aerial sensors, to space-based sensors... basically capturing UAP... that is known not to be from any technologically nation on Earth... which people call NHI - Non Human Intelligence. And the program was to acquire imagery of how other nations may have reverse engineered, from NHI technology, human technology."
George Knapp: "This program is a USAP - an Unacknowledged Special Access Program." 
Jeremy Corbell: "Michael Shellenberger said that members of congress had been made aware. That is 100% true and I can testify to it under oath in the court of law because I was f&%#@$# there."
Jeremy Corbell: "From the very get go, we have been in the know that we have been trying to exploit derivative technologies of UAP."  
Jeremy Corbell: "Everyone is looking for David Grusch to speak outside his DOPSR (Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review) or his pre-publication agreement..."
"Right now it is very real, and people don't understand that. There is a program the government has hid from Senate, from Congress, from the gang of eight, it is called Immaculate Constellation, and by the... way, that is just the top of the pyramid, a piece of the pie chart. There is more up there, and there are a *lot* of "constellations" below... That (Immaculate Constellation) is a tiny thing, we are just talking about it right now because it is public, but there is a much bigger story to tell..." 

This is important to note, that as this wave of whistleblowers comes forward and begins testifying to Congress and in public, including Chris Mellon, David Grusch, Lou Elizondo, Tim Gallaudet, David Fravor, etc., they are still bound to the military and government approval processes regarding what they can and can not publicly disclose. 

Danny Sheehan explains: 

"There is a lot going on behind the scenes... one of the things that people who have worked in Washington DC for 20 years or more realize is that the public hearings that take place in congress are kind of dog and pony shows... and that they are semi-scripted as a rule... there is a decision made on high as to what is going to get said publicly and what isn't, what questions are going to get asked and what aren't... and so there is bit a of theater involved, more than a bit of theater involved, and what is going on in the background is the real deal making. And the challenge in Washington DC, among many others, is that everything is a deal."

"It is not a matter of principle, it is not a matter of what the program needs, it is a question of the kind of false dialectic that is going on. Now we have come into the scene with the UFO phenomena... the one everyone knows about... is the December 17, 2017 front page story in the New York Times, Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon, and Chris Mellon, very importantly, was the deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, both under the Clinton... and W Bush administration... and Lou Elizondo was involved in the program that the Pentagon had, a secret program, above top secret... where they were attempting to develop... an advanced weapons system using the technology they recovered from UFO craft... The thing that people don't realize, is that there was this big hubub with the front page story in the New York Times, and everyone is saying "oh here is two amazing whistleblowers coming out of the shadows, and they have come forward, and they have made this extraordinary set of revelations about the existence of this secret program, and it turns out the whole thing was authorized... that the United States Defense Department Office of Prepublication Security Review... had cleared all of those videos to be shown, and had ok'd the New York Times to publish them, so there is this whole back story going on, that there is a pretense of an insurrectionist kind of whistleblower group coming forward to reveal this information and challenge the deep secrets of the state... but in fact there is decisions being made deeper in to reveal... The bottom line is that for some reason, which we can explore, there has been a decision made at the very end of 2017, to come forward, to begin a process of trying to establish control, literally, over the disclosure of the UFO information. And it actually generated an extraordinary piece of legislation that the United States approved, which was **a 64 page bill** that set up this complex process of undertaking a "Controlled Disclosure", and actually formulating a controlled disclosure campaign to go over a 7 year to start rolling out information into the public about what it is that the United States Government knew about the UFO phenomenon, and about some vaguely identified Non Human Intelligence." 

(LEFT OFF HERE). 

George Knapp: "Elon Musk came out this week... and told Tucker Carlson, "All these UFOs are advanced secret US technology." ... Elon should know, right? It seemed like gaslighting to me... I would just put it this way... giving him the benefit of the doubt. Let's put him in the category of... he has billions of dollars worth of contracts with the Department of Defense, with NASA... let's say he is on par with an Admiral Wilson, and he knows stuff, and *is required* to lie about it." 

"We are not alone." - Everyone involved 

"The technology we faced was far superior to anything that we had." - Commander Fravor, in sworn testimony to US Congress. 

"The far horizon is that we are going to make it through this, in fits and starts, and we are going to have a new civilization begin on this planet, the hallmark of which is a peaceful planet on Earth, living peacefully with these other planets. To get from criticality now to that point is going to be a *very* heavy lift. (This) pulled me out of my work as an emergency doctor because I realized that we are in a global emergency, and that is why I left medicine. The cosmic flag that I want to talk about is the crown jewel of the secrecy that was hatched in the 50s, that led to Eisenhower losing control of these programs. And no President since that time has had full operational control over these rogue elements. So now we are in a period where these operations have run amok, so much so that it has become an existential threat to life on Earth." - Stephen Greer
