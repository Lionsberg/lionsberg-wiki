# 3.16 The Quality of the New World
A few may get a glimpse of the [[New World]] in advance. No one can see what is coming in all its Glory. 
 
The quantum tectonic shift is at hand. Mountains are about to rise.  Great cities are about to fall. 
 
A [[New World]] will emerge in the [[New]] millennium that will be unrecognizable from the [[Old World]] of the [[Old]] millennia. 
 
The entire System is about to transform. 

The System Wise phase shift is at hand. 
 
Everything we do must be imbued with the [[Quality]] of the [[New World]].
 
That [[Quality]] can be known and embodied through each individual as a [[Pattern Language]]. 
 
The Patterns all reflect and are harmonized with the [[Quality]]. 

The [[Quality]] is the Fundamental Tone. 
 
The [[Quality]] of the [[New World]] causes all generations of life to elevate, transform, and rise towards their greatest potential. 
 
The core harmonizing [[Quality]] is [[Love]]. 

Because [[ONE]] is [[Love]]. 
 
It is core harmonizing [[Quality]] of the [[New]].
