The [Process] and [Practice] through which we help all [Creation] rise and progress towards the [Goal] is one of deep transformation and becoming. It is a process of transforming and being transformed.
 
We first understand the [Intent] of the [One]. 

We then analyze the existing forces and conditions. 

We see the gap. 

We then act in the most wise, powerful, and pragmatic way we are capable of to transform the root causes of suffering and injustice so that true, sustainable, flourishing wellbeing can emerge.
 
With the right levers, and the partnership of [One] and [All], we can move and transform heaven and earth for the benefit of the [One We Love].
