# 3.1 The Meta Quest
Ok. Now that we have made our subconscious stories conscious, our next step is to see if we can align our individual stories within a [[Meta Story]] that will allow us to [[Perceive]] a similar subset of [[Reality]].  

If we cannot agree on the [[Meta Goal]] of the [[Meta Quest]], we will not be able to orient and move together, for we will not be perceiving the same subset of the universe, or heading in the same direction within it. 

What is a [[Quest]]? 

_A quest is a [[Journey]] toward a specific [[Mission]] or a [[Goal]]. In folklore, this word is often used to describe a difficult or epic [[Journey]] towards a great prize, which is often infused with sacred, symbolic or allegorical meaning. Tales of [[Quests]] figure prominently in the folklore of every tribe, nation and tradition._ 

What is [[Meta]]? 

The word [[Meta]] is used to describe something transcendent, beyond, self-referential, or of a higher order kind. 

In our [[New]] language, we are using it describe something of the [[Highest Order]] kind. 

The [[Meta Quest]] therefore is our highest overarching and uniting [[Journey]] towards our highest overarching and uniting [[Goal]] - the [[Meta Goal]]. 

By definition, the [[Meta Goal]] is the only possible Goal of the [[Meta Quest]]. They are each the Highest Order One of their kind, and contain withthemselves and order All other Quests, and All other Goals.
