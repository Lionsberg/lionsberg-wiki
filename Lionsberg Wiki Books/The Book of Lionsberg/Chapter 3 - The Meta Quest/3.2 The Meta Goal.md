# 3.2 The Meta Goal
If [[All]] of [[Creation]] was engaged in One unifying, highest order Quest, what would its Goal be? 

If we [[All]] are adving towards something, what is It? 

What is it that [[ONE]] Intends for [[All]]? 

Like all things that belong to the [[Meta]] realm, it relates to the [[Absolute]] and therefore cannot be concretized and set it stone. 

Yet we [[All]] have a natural intuition for it. 

If we Love something, we desire for it to develop into the fullness of its unique [[Potential]] and flourish. 

If [[ONE]] Loves [[All]], It would desire for [[All]] things to develop into the fullness of their unique Potentials and flourish in harmony with [[One Another]]. 

Therefore the [[Meta Goal]] can be expressed in terms such as: 

_The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of All generations of Life._

It is what lies at the end of the [[Logic of Love]] flowing from [[ONE]] to [[All]], from [[All]] to [[All]], and from [[All]] to [[ONE]].
