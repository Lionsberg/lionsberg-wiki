# 3.5 The Universal Movement
The essence of the spiritual element is the great universal movement towards [[Unity]] through [[Love]].
 
The great movement of [[All]] things towards [[The Goal]]. 
 
The great movement of [[All]] things towards the [[ONE]]. 
 
The great movement of all things towards [[Coherence]], [[Integrity]], and [[Wholeness]].
 
This [[Meta Movement]] encompasses and transcends all other motion.

Every other movement is secondary to the primary [[Meta Movement]] of [[All]] upwards towards [[The Goal]]. 

Upwards towards our [[Best And Highest]] [[Destiny]].
