# 3.4 Supercharging Progress
If we were Elevating and Transforming towards our [[Best And Highest]] [[Potential]] in isolation, there would be a number of ways we could go about it. 

However since it is impossible to reach the fullness of our [[Potential]] unless and until [[All]] things reach the fullness of thier [[Potential]], there is only [[ONE]] [[Logos]] or [[Logic]] that solves the equation. 

That is the [[Logic of Love]]. 

The [[Logic of Love]] constrains and compels us to Elevate and Transform in a very particular [[Way]]: 

_By helping [[All]] do the same._

If [[All]] things Elevate and Transform by helping [[All]] things [[Elevate And Transform]], incredible [[Synergy|Synergetic]] powers are unleashed as all things accelerate [[One Another]] upwards towards [[The Goal]]. 

In addition to being what Logically flows from the [[Spirit]] of [[Love]], in a complex adaptive system of systems it is also very near the definition of [[Good|Goodness]]: that we Help, and do not Harm, [[All]] elements of the System we Interact with. 

Therefore the [[Logos]] that supercharges Progress in the [[Meta Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] is: 

We **PROGRESS** by [[Elevate And Transform|Elevating and Transforming]]  

**FROM**: Our current [[State of Being]]  

**TO**: Our [[Best And Highest]] [[Potential]]  

**BY**: Helping [[All]] do the same 
 
**THROUGH**: [[Love]]. 

The [[Meta Quest]] can be thought of as the [[Meta Movement]] of [[All]] things towards [[The Goal]] through [[Love]]. 

This very closely maps to the timeless understanding that the spiritual element in the universe is that which moves us towards [[Unity]] through [[Love]]. 

[[Love]] is the [[Logic]] of the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]].
