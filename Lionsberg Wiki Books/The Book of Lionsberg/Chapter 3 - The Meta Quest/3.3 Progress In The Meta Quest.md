# 3.3 Progress In The Meta Quest
If the [[Meta Quest]] is something like the movement of [[All]] things towards their best and highest [[Potential]]... 

...and if that ultimate Highest Potential and Greatest Good is beyond [[Where We Are]] today...

...then the [[Meta Quest]] necessarily becomes a [[Journey]] of [[Transformation]]. 

The only [[Way]] to progress towards the [[Meta Goal]] is by elevating and transforming our [[Self|Selves]] and our world:
 
FROM: Our current [[State of Being]]  
 
TO: Our Best and Highest [[Potential]]
