# 3.11 Rising Towards The Goal
Having set our [[Goal]] and [[Aim]] as the [[Most Worthy]] One we can conceive of and relate to, our daily purpose becomes clear. 

We must progress and rise towards the [[Most Worthy Goal]], which is One. 

And as we progress and rise, we must help All Creation progress and rise with us. 

In fact, we progress and rise towards the Goal of Love _by_ helping All things progress and rise with us. 

This is the [[Power]] of the [[Force]] and [[Logic of Love]]. 

It is the most powerful manifest [[Force]] in the universe, second only to the Source from which it flows.
