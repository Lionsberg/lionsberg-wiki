# 3.18 Powerful Love
[[Love]] is not weak. [[Love]] is the most powerful force in the [[Universe]]. It is the Divine essence of the [[ONE]] who creates and sustains All [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]]. [[Love]] is the only force that can reconcile, redeem, and heal the tribes, nations, peoples, and species of the earth.
 
[[Love]] is not idle. It does not stand by in non-involvement and tolerate oppression or exploitation. 

[[Love]] moves mountains and raises valleys to come to the aid of the One we Love. 

[[Love]] demands that we rush powerfully with the full force of our individual and collective being to come to the aid of those in need, those who are oppressed, those who are imprisoned, those who are exploited, those who are sick, those who suffer, those who mourn, those who are poor, those who are weak, those who are abused. 
 
The heart and power of [[Love]] liberates the captives, heals the sick, elevates the oppressed, seeks and saves the lost, and lifts the universe upward, every higher towards its potential.
 
[[Love]] is the lever that lifts All things.
