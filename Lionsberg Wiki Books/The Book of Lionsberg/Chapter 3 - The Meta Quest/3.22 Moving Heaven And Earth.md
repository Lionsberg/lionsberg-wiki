# 3.22 Moving Heaven And Earth
Hearing her cries for help... 

Seeing plainly the acute danger and suffering our Loved One is in...

Animated by the ferocious and powerful [[Love]] of the Mother, the Father, and the [[One]], we begin to move heaven and earth to transform the root causes of suffering and injustice that are plaguing the [[One We Love]].

We will not rest until the [[Chaos]] and Oppression have been vanquished, and a new [[Order]] that is [[Good]] has been established. 

The Chaos is mighty, but our Spirit is Greater. 

We rise above it. We hover over it. We speak to it and vanquish it with the Sword that flashes forth from our mouth.
