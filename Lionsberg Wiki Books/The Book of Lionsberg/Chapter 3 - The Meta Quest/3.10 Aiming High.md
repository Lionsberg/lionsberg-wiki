# 3.10 Aiming High
If we must [[Aim]], how high shall we [[Aim]]? 

How high can we [[Aim]]? 

How high can we conceive? 

If we must [[Aim]], towards what other [[Aim]] shall we consciously progress if not towards the Highet and the Best? 
 
Why consciously settle for anything less, and thereby doom ourselves and [[All]] generations of Life to less success, less happiness, and less flourishing than would have been possible had we dared to dream and believe? 

How high can we go? 

If we are going to Aim, why Aim for anything short of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]? 

Why Aim for anything short of the  [[Most Worthy]] Ideal? 

Why knowingly spend our lives in pursuit of anything less? 
 
The [[Highest Intention]], the [[Most Worthy Ideal]], is [[The Goal]]. 

If we Aim at its [[Source]], we shall never err, even if we miss the mark. 

As it is said, 

_"Be perfect, as [One] is perfect"_.
