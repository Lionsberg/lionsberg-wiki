# 3.14 Love
What is the Highest Intention? 
 
What answer could there be but [[Love]]? 

It is the answer that has poured forth throughout the millennia to the eternal question.
 
This hypothesis has been so thoroughly vetted across all cultures over thousands of years, that it is accepted as a [[Generalized Principle]] of the [[Meta Science]]. 
 
The permeating nature and Intention of the Spirit That Hovers Over the Waters of Chaos and Co-Creates That Which is Good is Love. 
 
The [[Universal Law]] is [[Love]].  

[[Love]] [[One]], and [[Love]] [[All]]. 

Love One, and Love your neighbor as your Self. 
  
[[Love]], understood and expressed into embodied [[Reality]], is the nature of the [[New World]]. It is the nature of the [[One]].  
 
It is the great [[Fundamental Tone]] that harmonizes the Symphony of [[Life]]. 

It is the overarching and uniting design principle that coheres the masterpiece. 
 
It is the fractally expressed guiding principle that permeates every element of the design, from the highest level conceptual [[Whole]], to the lowest level detail. 
 
[[Love]] is [[One]]. 

[[One]] is [[Love]]. 

[[One]] [[Love]]. 

[[One]] Life. 

[[One]]. 

[[Love]].
