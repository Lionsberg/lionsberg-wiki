# 3.21 The One We Love Is Suffering
As we look with loving compassion on the universal and [[All]]-encompassing [[One We Love]], we see that it she plagued by suffering and injustice. 

She is exploited and oppressed. 

She is being bullied and beaten up. 

She is riddled with the diseases inflicted upon her. 

She is starving for purpose, meaning, [Love], affection, attention, embrace, and belonging. 
 
She is in pain and suffering. 

She is afraid. 
 
Her [[Potential]] within is bursting at the seams and longing to emerge. Yet she is bound by chains that it cannot break free from alone.
 
If we [[Love]] her, then we will act with full force of our being to come to her aid. 

Now. 

We will not finish our dinner. We will not go to bed and hope she survives through the night. We will not assume that someone else will risk their life to save her. 

If the [[One We Love]] is suffering, we immediately rush to her aid. 

There is no other moral or ethical action in the joint presence of [[Suffering]] and [[Love]]. 

[[Love]] moves heaven and earth.
