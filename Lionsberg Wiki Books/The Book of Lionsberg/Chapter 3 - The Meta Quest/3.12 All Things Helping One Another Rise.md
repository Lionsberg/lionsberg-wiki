# 3.12 All Things Helping One Another Rise
If we [[Love One Another]], we will [[Help One Another]]. 

Awaken. Arise. Transcend. Ever higher towards flourishing and abundant life. 
 
The [[Creative One]] is [[Love]]. The [[Creative One]] loves All people and all [[Creation]]. 
 
The [[Creative One's Intent]] is for [[All]] things to rise into their unique fullness of being and flourish. 
 
The [[Creative One’s Intent]] is for [[All]] things to flourish in their greatest state of wellbeing, happiness, and harmony.
 
This [[Best And Highest]] [[Potential]] would be something like heaven on earth. 

A dwelling place in which fully enlightening consciousness could flourish for eternity. 
 
As we work together to [[Discern]] and [[Operationalize]] the [[Creative One’s Intent]], the [[New World]] progressively in-breaks and becomes our Reality. 

This is the motion of bringing heaven to earth. 

[[All]] things [[Helping One Another]] rise towards [[The Goal]]. 

The motion of bringing heaven to earth is the motion of helping All things rise towards heaven. 

When All things are Helping One Another rise towards heaven, then [[New World]] is already here.
