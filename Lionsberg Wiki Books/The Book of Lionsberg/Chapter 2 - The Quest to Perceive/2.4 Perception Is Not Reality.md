# 2.4 Perception Is Not Reality
_"In order to begin to apprehend and comprehend the Nature of the [[Living System]] in which we find ourselves, we must first learn to accurately differentiate between our [[Perception]] and [[Reality]]._  
 
_There is an [[Old]] saying bantered around in the [[Caves]] that “Perception is reality”._  
 
_While it is psychologically true that for the Observer chained in the Cave the tiny fraction of 1% of the universe we actually perceive feels like our reality…_ 

_…it is also True that there is another 99.999….% of objective [[Reality]] beyond our Perception that we are either incapable of seeing or are ignoring._  

_Critically, we must understand that what we Do Not Perceive and [[We Do Not Know|Do Not Know]] makes up approximately All of the universe, and what we Do Perceive and Do Know makes up approximately none of the universe._  

_Therefore what we Do Not Perceive and Do Not Know is far more important, interesting, and relevant than what we Do Know and Perceive._ 

_Wise Right Perception is therefore first rooted in Humility and Right Relationship to the Absolute and the Unknown."_
