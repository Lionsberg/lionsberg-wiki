# 2.6 The Illusion of Spacetime
"*We mentioned that the first thing to know is that what you are currently perceiving is not [[Reality]] as such. It is a very low resolution and oversimplified image approximating Reality at a  level of analysis that is approximately useful.* 

*The [[Spacetime]] that you feel like you dwell in is an illusion of sorts.*  

*We cannot overemphasize the importance of liberating yourself from the constraints and illusion of [[Spacetime]].*  

*[[Spacetime]] is not fundamental. It is not objective. It is not Reality. And it is not objectively how Reality "works".*  

*Back inside the [[Boundary]], 99% of scientists are still modeling their theories and formulating their hypotheses as if [[Spacetime]] was a fundamental objective reality within which our world manifests itself.* 

*It is not so at all.* 

*The [[Spacetime]] that you [[Perceive]] is much better thought of as a simplified [[User Interface]] that allows your [[Consciousness]] to interact with [[Reality]] in all its infinite complexity.*  

*[[Spacetime]] is a purely a product of our individual perception.* 

*Out of the infinite array of actual [[Reality]], it simplifies things into shapes and sizes of things that we can interact with.*

*While this simplification is useful and necessary, it is critical to understand that when you pick up a “cup” and drink “water”, the “cup” is not ultimately a “cup”, and the “water” is not ultimately “water”.* 

*Those are simple outer forms we perceive and name.* 

*Each has a much deeper energetic nature.* 

*This [[Spacetime User Interface]] allows our [[Consciousness]] to [[Perceive]] and [[Interact]], through an embodied form, with a simplified representation of the ultimate underlying [[Reality]].*"
