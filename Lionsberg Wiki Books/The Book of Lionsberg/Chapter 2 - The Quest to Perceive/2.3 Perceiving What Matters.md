# 2.3 Perceiving What Matters
"_There are many things we must learn together, however the first [[Skill]] we must [[Learning|Learn]] is how to [[Perceive]] [[What Matters]] outside the [[Boundary]]._  

_Accurately Perceiving [[What Matters]] is the key to avoiding death and staying alive._ 

_What I am about to tell you may seem startling or unbelievable at first, but I beg you, for your own sake, to please temporarily suspend judgment and listen._  

_What I am about to say is a simplification, but it is likely far more accurate than the model you were taught in the cave. It will be an upgrade to your [[Mental Models]] that you can retain for as long as it is useful to you._"
