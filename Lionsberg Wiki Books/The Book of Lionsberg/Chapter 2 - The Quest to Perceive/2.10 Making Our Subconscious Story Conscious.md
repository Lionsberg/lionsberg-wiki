# 2.10 Making Our Subconscious Story Conscious
"Before we move on, let’s sort out our stories so that we can understand [[One Another]], [[Perceive]] together, and move [[Together]] towards our highest overarching and uniting shared [[Goal]]. 

Let’s take out our writing tools, pause, meditate, invite our Minds into a creative, imaginative, and childlike space...   

Question 1: What story are you telling yourself about you? 
1. Who are you? 
2. Where are you on your [[Quest]]? 
3. How did you get here? 
4. Where are you going? What is the [[Goal]] of your [[Quest]]? 

Question 2: What story are you telling yourself about us as a human species? 
1. Who are we?

Question 6: What self-limiting beliefs or fears are present in your stories, that may limit our progress forward? 

Question 7: In order to be safe, loved, and accepted, I must (fill in the blank). 

Quetion 8: Are you willing to join us in choosing the [[Meta Goal]] as our highest overarching and uniting shared Goal? Are you willing to put the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]], and the [[One]] from Whom it flows, at the absolute top of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] and [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]]? 

If we cannot agree on the [[Meta Goal]], we will not be able to orient and move together, for we will not be perceiving the same subset of the universe, or heading in the same direction within it.
