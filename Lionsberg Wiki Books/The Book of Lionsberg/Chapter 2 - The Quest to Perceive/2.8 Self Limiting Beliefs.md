# 2.8 Self Limiting Beliefs
*"Our Stories tell us [[Who We Are]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]]. They shape our [[Identity]].*

*They tell us [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]]. They thus shape our present, our past, and our future.* 

*They tell us our [[Goal|Goals]], and shape what we are moving towards and Why.* 

*These perceived identities and goals, structured narratively, largely determine the boundaries of what is possible for us.* 
 
*These stories exist at many fractal levels, from the individual, to the team, to the organization, to the community, to the state, to the nation, all the way out to the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves as a human species, the universe we find ourselves in, and the Source from which it all flows.* 
 
*What is possible for us in [[Reality]] is exceedingly and abundantly beyond anything we could imagine. We cannot even start to conceptualize the upper limits of what might be possible if all things helped one another rise towards the unknowable limits of [[Potential]].*  

*We cannot even start to conceptualize the upper limits of what might be possible if all things had Faith and believed that the [[Best And Highest]] was possible, and worth striving towards.* 
 
*The stories that we exist in largely determine our individual and collective destiny.* 
 
*They are also the principle limiters of our individual and collective destiny. They are the primary inhibitors of throughput of our Goal.* 

*This is because they are _always_ lower and baser than what Reality and its Source allow.* 

*There is one very important characteristic of these Stories, and that is that they only exist in our [[Mind]].* 
 
*The amazing thing is that because our unique stories exists only in our [[Mind]], and not objectively in [[Reality]], we have the power to consciously examine, elevate, and transform them.* 
 
*As we continuously elevate and transform our stories, we can retain all the benefits of our previous stories, while gaining tremendous new capabilities."*
