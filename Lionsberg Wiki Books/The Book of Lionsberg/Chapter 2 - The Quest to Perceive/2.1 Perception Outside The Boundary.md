# 2.1 Perception Outside The Boundary
The next morning we awoke, and invited the our new friends to make their Way out into the Light on the New Dawn. 

It was much easier for them to experience the first rays of Light before the sun emerged from behind its veil. 

Their skin was pale, their muscles atrophied, and they strained under the weight of Reality. 

_"Congratulations again._

_We have crossed the [[Threshold]] and taken our first steps out into Reality beyond the [[Boundary]]._

_How do you feel? Isn't it beautiful out here?_

_The [[Light]] can feel blinding at first, but don’t worry, it is absolutely magnificent and illuminating once you get used to it."_

The looks of pain, consternation, and sheer overwhelm reminded us that we had a problem on our hands. 

"_Ah... wait._

_We forgot, you don't yet Know How or What to [[Perceive]] out here._  

_Life outside the [[Boundary]] demands that we learn, or remember, how to [[Embody]] an entirely [[New]] yet [[Eternal]] [[Way]] of Being and [[Perceiving]]._  

_The [[Way of Being]] and [[Perceiving]] that works to stay alive within the [[Endarkenment]] of the [[Caves]] will get you killed you killed outside the [[Boundary]]._  

_Ok... everyone back into the Fortress, and let's meet in the Assembly Hall to align our lenses."_
