# 12.7 Ignorance and Unintentional Harm

It is a beautiful and dreadful thing to be human.

We Love. We understand what helps us and others. We understand what harms us and others. We try to do the right thing.

However through our ignorance and weakness we constantly harm our Selves and One Another.

This is not the same as malevolence.

Having the capacity for suffering ourselves… knowing what it means to hurt deeply… knowing what would hurt us deeply… knowing what would make us suffer…

And doing our very best to stumble through life, loving people, hurting people, but trying to do the right thing and apologizing when we make others suffer…

This is to be human, not evil. It is not willful harm. It is accidental harm borne of our ignorance, our weakness, and our fear.
