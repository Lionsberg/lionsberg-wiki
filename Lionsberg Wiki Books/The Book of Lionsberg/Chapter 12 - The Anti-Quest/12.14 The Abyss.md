# 12.14 The Abyss

When you finally confront, overcome, and bind the ultimate spirit of the Anti-Good and its penultimate manifestation, what do you do with such an evil dragon?

You cannot kill it, for its spirit cannot yet be killed.

All you can do it bind it and cast it into the abyss, place a seal over it, set a guard at the entrance, and celebrate in the paradise that emerges for a thousand years, while remaining vigilant and prepared and teaching your children to do the same, lest the snake once again appear in the garden to tempt the sons and daughters of God.
