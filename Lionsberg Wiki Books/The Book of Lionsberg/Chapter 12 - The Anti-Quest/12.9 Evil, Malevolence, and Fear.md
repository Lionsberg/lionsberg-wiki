# 12.9 Evil, Malevolence, and Fear

Having the capacity to fear ourselves… knowing what it means to fear deeply… knowing what would cause us to fear deeply…

And wishing this fear upon others…

Or worse working willfully and intentionally to inflict fear upon others…

This is evil. This is malevolence. This is anti-good. This is sin. 

You know what you are doing is going to inflict fear.

And yet you chose to do it anyway.

This is headlong rush down the Patterns of Death that lead towards Hell.
