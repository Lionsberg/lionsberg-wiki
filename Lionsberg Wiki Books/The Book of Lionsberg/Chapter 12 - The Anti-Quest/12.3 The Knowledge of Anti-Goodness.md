# 12.3 The Knowledge of Anti-Goodness

The Way to inoculate ourselves against anti-good is to slowly, voluntarily, and carefully get to know it. To understand its habits and its abode.

It is far easier to confront and slay dragons of anti-goodness when you understand them, are prepared, and go out voluntarily to confront and overcome them in their lair, rather than waiting in fear until they suddenly burst in upon you.

It is not wise to remain weak and na√Øve and wait to figure out how to deal with a dragon until it jumps out into your path as you tread through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

We must learn to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death in comfort, knowing that we are properly prepared, and that it is ultimately the [[ONE]] who is walking through us and fighting for us.
