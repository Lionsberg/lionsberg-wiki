# 12.8 Evil, Malevolence, and Intentional Harm

Having the capacity for suffering ourselves… knowing what it means to hurt deeply… knowing what would hurt us deeply… knowing what would make us suffer…

And wishing this harm upon others…

Or worse working willfully and intentionally to inflict harm upon others…

This is evil. This is malevolence. This is anti-good. This is sin. 

If you know that what you are doing is going to injure and inflict suffering, and you choose to do it anyway, this is headlong rush down the [[Patterns of Death]] that lead to Hell. 

If the essence of Love and Goodness is to [[Help]] and [[Do No Harm]], the essence of [[Evil]] is to consciously and intentionally inflict suffering and harm.
