# 12.6 The Gift and Curse of Fear and Anxiety

This innate fear and anxiety of the things that we know would cause pain, suffering or death has the benefit of helping us avoid those things and stay alive.

Fear and anxiety are a gift. We manifest them for a reason.

They help us sense and avoid the dragon that is seeking to devour us, and live to see another day.

And yet what a damned curse they are as well!

Unless we have experienced perpetual, deep, existential fear and anxiety, or lived with one who has, it is difficult to articulate the hellish and crippling suffering that the fear of suffering can cause.

***Many people suffer far more from the fear of suffering that from suffering itself***.
