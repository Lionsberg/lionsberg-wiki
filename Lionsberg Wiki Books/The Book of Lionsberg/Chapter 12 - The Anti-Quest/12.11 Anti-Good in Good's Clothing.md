# 12.11 Anti-Good in Good's Clothing

And as the forces that forsake the [[ONE]] wait and plot, they often lurk about like wolves in sheepâ€™s clothing.

Hiding in churches, mosques, synagogues, ashrams, and other dojos. In governments. In non-profits. Concealed by the lies and viscous false words that drip like blood from the lips of the guilty after they have consumed the innocent.

And when the spirit, wisdom, and intention of the One manifests itself in their domain, in-breaking and threatening their power, the sheep-skins fall off and they attack.

Religious and government leaders, suddenly conspiring to kill the embodied voice and manifestation of the One that threatens to expose them for the illegitimate and traitorous brood of vipers that they are.

The life and words of Jesus illustrate this well.
