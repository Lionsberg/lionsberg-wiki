# 12.4 Pain, Suffering, and Death

Perhaps a good place to begin the theory of anti-goodness is with a theory of pain, suffering, and death.

The great gift and curse of human consciousness is that:

1)    We can consciously understand and can contemplate what pain, suffering, and death are, even when we are not experiencing them.

2)    We can consciously understand that even if we are not experiencing them now, we are capable of experiencing them in the Future.

3)    We can consciously understand that not only are we capable of experiencing them, but that is inevitable that we will experience them.

4)    We can consciously understand that not only is it inevitable that we will experience them in this life, it is also possible that we might experience them in life after death. 

5)    We can consciously understand that not only will we experience these things, but our loved ones will all experience them.

So here we are. Face to face with the inevitable pain, suffering, death, and possible extension of those into eternity for us and all our loved ones.

If that is not enough to give you pause you haven’t thought about it enough yet.
