# 9.42 Using Our Best Judgment And Doing Our Best To Bring The Highest Intention Into Reality

The [[Way]] to avoid the [[Hell]] of [[Absolute Chaos]] or [[Absolute Order]] is to Voluntarily [[Stacking Up And Aligning|Stack Up And Align]] [[Sovereignty]] from the [[Bottom Up]], starting with the [[Deepest Thing]], and returning to the [[Highest Thing]], which are [[ONE]]. 

This is the only [[Way]] towards [[Proper Order]], the equilibrium that contains neither an excess or lack of [[Order]]. 

Because the [[Endstate]] of [[Proper Order]] is entirely voluntary, we cannot get there through Compulsion or the use of Force or [[Power Over]] another. 

And yet because the [[Endstate]] of [[Proper Order]] is actually a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that can pragmatically meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities inherent in any moment in the Story, we understand that it takes tremendous systems, coordination, infrastructure, and mutual aid that can only be brought forth in partnership. So we can't remain isolated, working solely towards our [[Individual And Local]] Goals and Values.
