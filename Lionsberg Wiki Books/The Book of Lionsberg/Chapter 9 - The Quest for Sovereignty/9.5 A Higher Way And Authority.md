# 9.5 A Higher Way And Authority

Few issues are more germane to the heroic [[Quest]] towards our [[Destiny]] than the issue of [[Authority]].

This is because the hero must rediscover their true [[Identity]] and [[Sovereignty]], which empowers them to [[Break The Rules]] in order to do what the [[Wise Right Thing]]. 

The hero [[Break The Rules]] of [[Society]] in order to do what is right, and acts as if this liberty is an obvious birthright, because it is. 

The hero [[Act As If|Acts As If]] they sincerely believed they were a child of the eternal King, and therefore prior to every temporal human law of [[Authority]] in whatever [[Time]] or [[Space]] they happen to find themselves [[Thrown]] into.

And yet the hero does not abolish the human law, but reminds and calls humanity up towards a Higher and [[More Perfect Law]], a Higher and [[More Perfect Way]], and a Higher and [[More Perfect Authority]] than could ever be articulated or embodied in human writing or in human institution.

What is the [[Source]] of this [[Authority]]?

And why is it so confusing and confounding to temporal watchers and temporal authorities?

The [[Authority]] of the hero flows directly from the [[Meta Authority]] of the [[Universe]] and is therefore transcendent of and higher than every temporal authority on earth. 

The [[Source]] of [[Being]] and [[Authority]] are [[ONE]].
