# 9.38 Commanders Intent

[[Commander's Intent]] in the armed forces is akin to [[Designer's Intent]] in architecture, engineering, and construction. 

This notion is crucial to the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

The [[Commander's Intent]] is the [[Endstate]] the Commander desires. 

It is the [[Unifying Principle]] or [[Unifying Focus]] that draws all [[Subordinate]] elements up into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. 

In general, Commanders Intent must: 
- Articulate the [[Purpose]] of the [[Mission]]  
- Articulate the [[Conditions of Satisfaction]] that characterize the [[Endstate]]. 
- Articulate the [[Current Best Understanding]] of the Key milestones and activities that mark the [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]]. 
- Be clearly understood at least two levels below the issuing commander. 

Why introduce the notion of [[Commander's Intent]] into a [[System]] that is not based on [[Command And Control]]? 

Crucially, the notion of all [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and Self Governing elements voluntarily aligning themselves to a shared [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]...

...is what liberates us [[All]] from inevitability of being subordinated to a structure of authoritarian control. 

When the Meta Commander of [[All]] is [[ONE]], each and every [[Individual]] and Locality is liberated from ever having to obey a local directive that in their [[Best Judgment]] violates the Universal [[Commander's Intent]]. 

Additionally, they gain an objective philosophical, moral, and legal defense for rejecting / refusing to validate or participate in any [[Proposal]] or directive that, in their [[Best Judgment]], would prevent the Group from accomplishing its Aim in full harmony and integrity to the [[Commander's Intent]]. 

Beyond liberation from the obligation to obey orders that contradict the [[Highest Intention]], [[Commander's Intent]] / [[Designer's Intent]] also implies an Affirmative [[Responsibility]] of every Individual and Locality to organize them Selves, their Families, their Groups, and their Resources, to help [[Progressively Realize]] the [[Highest Intention]].
