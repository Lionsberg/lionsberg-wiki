# 9.10 Developing And Articulating Across Time

The development of a body of [[Law]] can be likened to the development of all basic human consciousness and frameworks.

It might be that the [[Left Hemisphere]] of the [[Mind Of Society]] deals with logic and maintains a simplified and stable articulated framework or map by which society is navigating through the world. 

It might be the that [[Right Hemisphere]] of the [[Mind Of Society]] is more creative and exploratory in nature and updates the logic of the map based on the entire [[Gestalt]] of what it encounters in the [[Reality]] it is venturing out into.

In this way the logically [[Articulated Framework]] complexities and updates itself over time as a result of its own inadequacies, in response to the discovery of scenarios when the existing map of [[Reality]] fails to work in [[Reality]], or where there are discrepancies and anomalies between the [[Map]] and [[Reality]]. 

As in all frames of conscious development, in these update scenarios the [[Map]] should be updated in a way that retains all the best elements of the previous [[Map]] / [[Way]], while becoming capable of performing more competently across a broader [[Span Of Reality]] / [[Array Of Scenarios]]. 

Conscious [[Development]] is not a matter of discarding the [[Old]] in its entirety at each transformation and beginning anew from zero. 

It is a matter of continual and conscious evolution or transformation to become ever more competent and effective in advancing towards [[The Goal]]. 

In the mythological stories, each time the [[Phoenix]] rises from the ashes, it gets stronger and more competent because the [[Spirit]] guiding its subsequent transformations across [[Time]] is retained, purified, and improved, even as various temporal incarnations are laid down and "die". 

As people and cultures meet, they can communicate, share maps, and create new and better frameworks by [[Abstracting Out]] and [[Synthesizing]] what is [[Most Good]] about each of the previous frameworks, and dispensing with the elments of the [[Old]] Stories and [[Old]] frameworks that we know understand are not [[True]], or are [[No Longer Serving Us Well]]. 

These articulated bodies of information are part of the collective inheritance of [[Metaphysical DNA]] passed from one generation to the next, which is the [[Information]] that animates and instructs the [[Energy]] of [[Society]] and inform it how to behave and manifest itself.
