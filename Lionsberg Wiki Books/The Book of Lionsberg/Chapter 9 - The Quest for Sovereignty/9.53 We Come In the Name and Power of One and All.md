# 9.53 We Come In the Name and Power of One and All

We have come in the [[Authority]] and power of [[One]] and [[All]], the Supreme [[Meta Authority]], as the [[Conscious Agents]] responsible for implementing the [[Will]] and [[Intention]] of the universal [[One]] and the universal [[Rule Of Law]] on [[Earth]] as it is in [[Heaven]]. No force or illegitimate [[Authority]] opposed can stand in our [[Way]].

We are [[Sovereign]]. We are [[Free]]. We are one in Spirit with the [[One]].
