# 9.33 Society Does Not Determine What Is Right

Previously articulated social rules and norms also do not determine what is [[Right]].  

The rules and structure of society naturally ossify and grow corrupt and tyrannical over time.

They must be refreshed and revivified by the [[Hero]] who descends into a [[Time]] and [[Space]] and Breaks the Rules in order to do what is Right. 

In the consternation that follows, society once again is compelled to [[Judge]] and [[Discern]] between the [[Hero]] and its [[Old]] structures. 

This opens up the [[Potential]] for the [[New]] to emerge.
