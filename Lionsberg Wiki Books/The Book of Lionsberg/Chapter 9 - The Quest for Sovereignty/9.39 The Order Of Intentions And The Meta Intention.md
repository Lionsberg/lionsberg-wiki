# 9.39 The Order Of Intentions And The Meta Intention

While the commander in chief of any small or large pirate ship, department, company, branch, division, military, nation, or coalition of the [[Old World]] may argue that they are in charge, and "court martial" or "send to the brig" those who refuse to obey, the [[Reality]] is that at the top of the [[Order]] is [[One]] and [[One]] alone. 

We discussed already the [[Order of Authority]], and the [[One]] [[Meta Authority]] at the absolute top. 

Tying this out to the notion of [[Commander's Intent]], we can establish in parallel the conceptual [[Truth]] of an [[Order of Intent]], with [[One]] [[Meta Intention]] at the absolute top. 

In All ways, the absolute supremacy of the [[One]] creates [[Freedom]] and [[Liberty]] for [[All]], because it creates a Highest Authority that each of us is individually and directly responsible to. 

In this case because it creates the spiritual, moral, and legal responsibility for each [[Individual]] to understand for themselves the [[Highest Intention]], and do their best to organize their [[Self]] and their World to bring the [[Intention Into Reality]].
