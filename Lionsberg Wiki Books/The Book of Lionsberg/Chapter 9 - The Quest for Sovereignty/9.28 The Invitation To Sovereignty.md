# 9.28 The Invitation To Sovereignty

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] demonstrated long ago that if we will not [[Govern]] and master our [[Selves]], we are condemned to be mastered and Governed by others. 

[[Sovereignty]] and [[Freedom]] is a sacred [[Responsibility]].

For thousands of years, [[One]] has been calling us [[All]] up into the highest [[Freedom]] and [[Right Relationship]] that is available to every son or daughter the [[One]].

The scriptures read like dramatic [[Love]] Story, with the [[Creative One]] desperately longing for Loving [[Right Relationship]] with humanity. 

The invitation is to look not to human beings, but directly to the [[One]] as our [[Sovereign]] and [[[Central Organizing Relationship]]. 

It is an invitation that extends back to the dawn of [[Creation]].
