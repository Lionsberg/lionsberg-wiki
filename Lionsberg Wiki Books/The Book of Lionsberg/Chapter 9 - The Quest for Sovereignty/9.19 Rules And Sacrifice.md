# 9.19 Rules And Sacrifice

Rules are a critical and fundamental element of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Conditions]] that must be [[Co-Created]] to encourage us to make sacrifices and short term behavioral changes in order to transform and improve the [[Future]] that will manifest to us.

[[Rules]] are essential to creating a productive game that we can play together.  

Where there are no agreed upon [[Rules]], the people perish. 

A [[Meta Game]] requires a [[Meta Rule]], that contains and orders within itself the [[Total Nested Hierarchy Of Rules]] required for the Game to succeed eternally. 

Both the [[Meta Game]] and its [[Total Nested Hierarchy Of Rules]] must be constructed in a [[Wise]] and [[Fair]] [[Way]], such that we can reasonably expect that if we all [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] a certain [[[Way of Being]], we will be able to play together across a large period of [[Time]] and [[Space]], in a [[Way]] that causes a better [[Future]] to manifest for us [[All]]. 

Without [[Rule Of Law]], Individuals and Localities will not [[Sacrifice]].
