# 9.46 The Sovereignty, Authority, and Loyalty of Every Individual Citizen or Member of Any Old World Structure

We call upon every individual leader, member, and citizen of any [[Old World]] structure to recognize that your supreme duty and allegiance is to [[One]] and [[All]], and to the [[Universal Law]]. 

And NOT to any local or provincial ruler or oligarchy.

If an authority directs you to harm or hinder to another and you obey, you are guilty of treason against the [[One]].

If you exercise power or authority to the harm of another, you have broken the highest law, and you are individually responsible.

“I was doing what I was told” is never an excuse for breaking the highest law.

Do not fear the illegitimate local authority to whom you are accountable.

Fear the [[Meta Authority]] to whom we are [[All]] accountable.
