# 9.43 The Sovereignty, Autonomy, And Responsibility Of Every Individual Soldier, Officer, And Wielder Of Force

Soldiers, Officers, and those trained to wield [[Force]] on behalf of [[Society]] are usually required to take vows to submit to and obey the orders they are given from the [[Hierarchy]]. 

We hereby pronounce every Soldier, Officer, and Wielder of Force, like all other members of [[Society]], [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and [[Free]]. 

Of course it is [[Good]] to collaborate and obey orders when the orders are [[Good]], and the System is aligned with the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]]. 

However the moment there is a break in the alignment, and obeying an Order issued by a human would violate the [[Universal Order]] issued by the [[ONE]], we must choose who to Obey, and who to Fear. 

For those in the military, this is likely best conceptualized via the notion of [[Commander's Intent]]. 

Like every human being on earth, every soldier, officer, and wielder of force is [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and [[Free]]. 

Our supreme duty and allegiance is not to any provincial institution or oligarchy on earth, but to [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

If an authority directs you to harm or hinder to another and you obey, you are guilty of the highest order treason against the [One].

If you exercise power or weapons against the weak, you have broken the highest law, and you are individually responsible.

“I was doing what I was told” is never an excuse for breaking the [Highest Law].

Do not fear the illegitimate authority to whom you are accountable.

Fear the [Meta Authority] to whom we are [All] accountable.

It is inexcusable to betray your [Soul] to save your [Life].
