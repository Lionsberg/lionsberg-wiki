# 9.18 The Meta Law

We can arrive at a shared and universal [[Meta Law]] through the same processes of conscious communication, comparison, meditation, and abstraction through which we arrive at all aspects of [[Wisdom]] and [[Philosophy]].

If Hammurabi has a code, and Moses has a code, and a South American tribe has a code, a European tribe has a code, and an Asian tribe has a code, they can sit down together, compare notes, abstract out what is in common and [[Most Good]] between them, and forge a shared and higher [[Way]] of being that will allow them and their societies to cooperate and work together.
