# 9.2 Navigating Through The Unknown

When one thinks of [[Sovereignty]], one often thinks of [[Governance]].

The word “govern” is derived from Greek and Latin words which mean “to steer”.

This is a beautiful reminder. 

How do we wisely navigate or steer through the infinite unknown on our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]?

How do we rightly navigate the [[Vessel]] of [[Life]] and [[Society]] throughout the millennia?

How do we keep on the course, and prevent our vessel from being dashed on the rocks of [[Chaos]]? 

We have a [[Navigation Issue]].
