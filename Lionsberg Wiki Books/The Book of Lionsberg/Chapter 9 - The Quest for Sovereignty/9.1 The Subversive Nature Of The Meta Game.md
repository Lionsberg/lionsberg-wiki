# 9.1 The Subversive Nature Of The Meta Game

This book is dangerous.

The [[Meta Game]] is subversive.

For the [[Goal]] inherently lies beyond the total transformation of [[Authority]] on earth.

There is no way to accomplish [[The Goal]], without a fundamental transformation and realignment of all [[Power]] and [[Authority]] that is not aligned in service of [[The Goal]].

The nations and kingdoms of the [[Old World]] must become the rightly related [[Meta Community]] of the [[New World]].

In the [[New World]], there is no corrupt or illegitimate authority oppressing vulnerable populations.

That kind of injustice is incompatible with the [[New]]. 

It is incompatible with [[Where We Are Going]].
