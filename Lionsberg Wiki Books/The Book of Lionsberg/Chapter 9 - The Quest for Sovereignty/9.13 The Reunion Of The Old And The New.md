# 9.13 The Reunion Of The Old And The New

The [[Antidote]] to this [[Fundamental]] / [[Conservative]] and [[Progressive]] / [[Liberal]] dichotomy is not divide them against one another. 

It is to [[Reunite]] and [[At-One]] them by walking in the [[Way]] of the [[ONE]] who is eternally guiding the [[Subsequent Transformations]] of [[All]] [[Creation]] as it elevates and transforms towards its [[Destiny]] and [[Goal]]. 

The [[Law]] and [[Way]] of the [[ONE]] is eternal and unchanging. It is the most fundamental and conservative and ancient and proven approach one could possibly take.

And yet the [[Law]] and [[Way]] of the [[ONE]] is also Continual [[Transformation]]. It is the most progressive and liberal and transformative approach one could possibly take.  

We just have to be able to rise [[Above The Chaos]] and see it as such. 

It is the simple, transcendent, [[Truthful]], Higher perspective that sees [[All]], perceives [[All]], and Reconciles and Redeems [[All]].
