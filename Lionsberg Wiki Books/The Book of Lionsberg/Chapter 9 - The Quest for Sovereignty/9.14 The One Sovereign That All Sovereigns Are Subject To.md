# 9.14 The One Sovereign That All Sovereigns Are Subject To

The notion of [[Individual And Local]] [[Sovereignty]] cannot exist without the Higher Idea that there is [[One]] [[Sovereign]] that [[All]] [[Sovereigns]] without exception are subject to. 

The [[Individual And Local]] [[Sovereignty]] of each Drive or Personality, if not integrated into some kind of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]], actually becomes a schizophrenic tyranny of the various Drives warring and grasping at the [[Control Tower]] of the [[Whole]].  

For this reason, an Individual, Locality, or Whole of any kind simply cannot stand or function properly unless it integrates its various [[Subordinate]] Systems into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] within its Self, and then subsequently integrates its Self into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with the various [[Superordinate]] Systems it is a part of. 

Above [[All]] [[Superordinate]] Systems is [[One]]. 

This is the eternal idea, found in all religions, that God's Law stands above every written law on earth, and above every nation, ruler, and authority, such that [[All]], equally and without exception, are subject to [[One]].
