# 9.4 Freedom Isn't Free

Everyone wants [[Freedom]]. But [[Freedom]] isn’t free.

The default condition in our modern society isn’t freedom. It is slavery, scarcity, and suffering.

Without a fierce and heroic battle to rediscover who we truly are, come into the fullness of that higher [[Identity]], and rightly judge and rule ourselves so we can rightly judge and rule [[All]] things, there is no [[Freedom]].

There is only the authoritarian control, suffering, and scarcity that is left when we fail to take up our [[Sovereignty]] and [[Responsibility]], and thereby abdicate  our [[Governance]] to others.

Voluntary slavery comes with great certainty. All it costs us is our [[Freedom]], our [[Potential]], our [[Joy]], and the opportunity to discover and achieve our [[Destiny]].

[[Freedom]] comes with great [[Authority]], [[Responsibility]], [[Risk]], and [[Adventure]].
