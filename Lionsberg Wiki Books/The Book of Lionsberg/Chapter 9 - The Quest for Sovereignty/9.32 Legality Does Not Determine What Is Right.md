# 9.32 Legality Does Not Determine What Is Right

Previously articulated and written human laws do not determine if something is legal or [[Right]]. 

The [[Spirit]] of the [[Meta Law]] determines what is legal, [Right], and [Wise], regardless of if articulated human law has caught up with it or not.  

Every temporal body of human Law is merely a shallow attempt to articulate something [[Universal]] and [[Eternal]].
