# 9.11 The Insufficiency And Inadequacy Of The Old

As we [[Elevate And Transform]] across [[Time]], we will always, [[Individually And Collectively]], be confronted with the fact of the insufficiency and inadequacy of the [[Old]].

As [[Reality]] and [[Consciousness]] evolve, we will always find ourselves in a [[New]] position that the [[Old]] frameworks are not suited for, with a [[New]] and better understanding than the [[Old Frameworks]] reflect.

This is the basic conflict that gives rise to the [[Potential]] for enduring horrendous abuse at the hands of stultifying fundamentalism in the face of rapidly evolving [[Reality]] and [[Consciousness]].

The [[Old]] is (nearly always) outdated. Beset by corruption and decay. Willfully blind. Devoid of the Spirit that once brought it into Life. 

Created for another time and place that are certainly not [[Here]] and [[Now]].
