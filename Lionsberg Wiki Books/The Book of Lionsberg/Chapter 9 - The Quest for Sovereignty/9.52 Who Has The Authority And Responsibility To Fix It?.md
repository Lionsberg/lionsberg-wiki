# 9.52 Who Has The Authority And Responsibility To Fix It?

There is nothing superficial about [[Truth]], [[Love]] and [[Justice]]. They leave no room for averting the eyes.

Someone needs to do the hard work of going up into the caves, evicting the robbers, bringing them to [[Justice]], and establishing the [[Authority]] of the [[One]], the [[Rule of Law]], and the reign of [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], and [[Wisdom]] over the roadways of life.

So who has the [[Authority]] to implement the universal [[Rule of Law]] and the reign of [[Peace]] and [[Justice]] on [[Earth]], as it is in [[Heaven]]?

You do. We do. This gets right back to the issue of [[Sovereignty]], [[Authority]], and [[Right Relationship]] with the [[One]].

You are a child of the King and Queen. If you see some little, illegitimate, corrupt nation state or army oppressing people, you, the individual have the responsibility to stand up, speak truth, and transform the situation.

The [[Way]] to fix it is to speak and embody the [[Truth]].
