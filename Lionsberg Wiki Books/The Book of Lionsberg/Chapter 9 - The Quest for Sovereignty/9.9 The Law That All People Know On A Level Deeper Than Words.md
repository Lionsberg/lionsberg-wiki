# 9.9 The Law That All People Know On A Level Deeper Than Words

This unending exercise leads us “know” on a level deeper than words, that there is an [[Absolute]] and inarticulable  [[Standard]] of the [[Perfect]] [[Ideal]], the perfect [[Way of Being]], that we are progressively conforming our [[Selves]] to. 

The [[Absolute]] and [[Perfect]] [[Ideal]] is [[One]]. 

The same [[One]] that belongs at the absolute pinnacle of every [[Order]].  

When we are in the presence of the [[Ideal]], we experience something like [[Awe]].

[[Awe]] facilitates an act or [[State of Being]] that is something like [[Worship]].

A state of being that is something like [[Worship]] facilitates our incredible ability to [[Imitate]].

Our incredible ability to [[Imitate]] facilitates the pragmatic act of [[Conforming]] ourselves to the [[Absolute]] we are standing in [[Awe]] of. 

However this is a process that cannot be completed by That Which Is Being Transformed alone. 

The [[New]] is a [[Divine Partnership]], a [[Synergy]], a [[Co-Creation]] between the [[Individual]], the [[Spirit]] guiding the transformation of the [[Individual]], and its [[Source]].

This, like any [[Golden Thread]], leads back to the basic spiritual impulse, which is the eternal movement towards [[Oneness]] through [[Love]]. 

This has been called [[Theosis]].

[[Theosis]] speaks to the [[Process]] of [[Transformation]] or [[Metamorphosis]] through which the [[Old]] / [[False Self]] is continually laid down, and the [[New]] / [[True Self]] is continually resurrected into every greater unity and conformity to the [[One]], in [[Divine Partnership]] with the [[One]].

“Be therefore Imitators of God.”

“You were created in the Image of God.”

“Transform yourself into the Image of God.”

“I pray that they would be one, even as we are [[One]].”

What does it mean to become one with the [[One]]? 

We always return to the mystery of what it means to progressively [[Elevate And Transform]] our [[Selves]] into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with the [[Absolute]], such that we become, individually and collectively, living Embodiments of Its [[Spirit]], and therefore [[Co-Creators]] of the [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]] It is creating and sustaining. 

Returning to Rules, Law, and Rule of Law, in the end we [[Realize]] that [[Embodying]] the [[Spirit]] of the [[One]] is the ultimate endeavor, and that it can only be impelled from within by the [[Spirit]], and never compelled from without by the [[Law]]. 

Just as we can teach elementary forms of mathematics or martial arts, we can teach children the basics of the [[Way]] of the [[One]].

However the ultimate [[Art]] and [[Science]] of living in the [[Way]] of the [[One]] is far beyond forms or words. 

To know the [[Way]] and the [[One]], one must live it. 

You cannot articulate all the situations, across every domain of space and time. And if you did, you would be so inundated and oppressed by the endless dogma that nearly everyone would be paralyzed and drown in the [[Chaos]] of too much stultifying [[Order]]. This is the trap of bureaucratic and dogmatic fundamentalist religion and ideology. 

As a book, turned into books, turned into dozens of books, turned into libraries of books, turned into institutions, authorities, and certifications to manage and update the books, you would soon learn that you need to lay down all the books, close your eyes, be present, meditate, and immerse your [[Self]] and your [[Consciousness]] as deeply as you can into its [[Source]], and then Be and Do what [[One]] would Be and Do.

And then to remain in that state of presence and unity with the [[One]] as you go out to confront the challenges and chaos of the world, and exist as a conduit of the [[One]] into the infinite array of complexity and change you find yourself in.

You must know the [[Way]] and the [[Law]] and the [[Spirit]] of the [[One]] on a level far deeper than words. 

The [[Universal Law]] is is about [[The Spirit Of The Law]], not [[The Letter Of The Law]].
