# 9.29 Humanity's Desire For A King

Human beings who are fearful and lack moral and spiritual [[Freedom]] have a strange desire for other human beings to rule over them and fight their battles.

Yet since the battle for our life and society runs directly through our own [[Soul]], we cannot abdicate this fundamental [[Responsibility]] to rule our Spirit and fight our battles to others. 

To do so is to sentence our [[Selves]] and our children to slavery and oppression.  

As soon as we betray our direct [[Right Relationship]] to [[ONE]], and take on a Religious or Political Leader as our [[Authority]], we immediately violate the [[Intention]] and [[Order]] required for Properly Ordered and Flourishing Society to manifest.
