# 9.24 Right Relationship And Inter-Existence

In a [[Universe]] of [[Inter-Existence]] in which we are consciously are of what causes [[Suffering]] and death, and what causes [[Joy]] and [[Life]]…

And in which we can consciously choose towards what ends we direct our [[Being]], [[Mind]], and [[Action]]…

Our basic affirmative [[Responsibility]] under the [[Universal Law]] is to render the mutual assistance due from every being to every being, as we all progress towards [[The Goal]]. 

Our basic restriction is that no being, organization, or community is allowed to inflict suffering, harm, or hinder the progress of others as we all strive to progress towards [[The Goal]].  

We must progress towards [[The Goal]] in [[Harmony]] and [[Right Relationship]] with all other [[Life]] that is also trying to progress towards [[The Goal]].

The one who unconsciously hinders the progress of others or causes others to suffer for the sake of their own [[Progress]] is foolish, ignorant, and unwise.

The one who consciously and willfully hinders the progress of others or causes others suffering for the sake of their own [[Progress]] is Enacting and Embodying [[Malevolence]]. 

The permeating principle of the [[Universal Law]] is [[Love]]. It is the nature of the [[ONE]].

[[Love]] demands that we help, and do not harm, life.

[[ONE]] demands that we help, and do not harm, Its sacred family of [[Life]].

In the final account, there is only one [[Life]], and only one [[Love]].

In the final account, there is only [[ONE]].
