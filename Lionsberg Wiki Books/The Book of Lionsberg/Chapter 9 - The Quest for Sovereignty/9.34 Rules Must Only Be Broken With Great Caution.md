# 9.34 Rules Must Only Be Broken With Great Caution

Just like the [[Higher Order]] rules and systems we are [[Co-Creating]] will be there to protect and preserve the order and structure of society for generations to come, so too are the rules and structure of society, no matter how corrupt, part of the fabric of society holding disaster and [[Chaos]] at bay.  

One [[Potential]] descent into [[Chaos]] occurs from failing to overthrow and revivify a failing and corrupt System. 

Another [[Potential]] descent into [[Chaos]] occurs from shattering the [[Old]] without something [[New]] to take its place. 

Rules must only be broken by the [[Hero]] with the greatest of caution, in a way that does not destroy, but elevates and transforms the underlying societal structure.

The generalized #principle is (something like):  

_A Rule or Law must only be broken when it would violate a [[Higher Order]] Rule or Law not to do so._

When we make the [[Quantum Leap]] / [[Phase Change]] from one framework to another, we must ensure that we do not destroy the entire old frame, but retain the very best of its benefits and incorporating them into the [[New]]. 

#warning Be careful if you kill the [[Spirit]] and structure of society in this transition, or you and your progeny may find yourself alone in the midst of the wolves for generations.
