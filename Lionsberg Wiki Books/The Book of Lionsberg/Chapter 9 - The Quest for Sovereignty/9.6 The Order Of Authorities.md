# 9.6 The Order Of Authorities

We discussed the [[Order of Loves]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Love]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Goals]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Goal]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Games]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Game]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Projects]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Project]].  

We discussed the [[Order of Laws]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta Law]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Systems]], integrated and cohered by the [[Meta System]]. 

Now we come to the issue of the [[Authority]]. 

Just like there are countless goals and drives, that must be integrated and properly ordered in service of the [[Meta Goal]] / [[Meta Drive]], so too are there countless authorities, which must be properly ordered and rightly related in service of the [[Meta Authority]].  

The [[Meta Authority]] is the highest order authority, which aligns all underlying authority into a functional unity which is capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in life and society.

What belongs at the top of the [[Order Of Authorities]]?

The only possible answer that does not immediately doom us to failure is:

The [[Meta Authority]].  

What is the [[Meta Authority]]?

It is what lies beyond and unifies all authority of which we can conceive. It is [[ONE]]. 

The [[Authority]] of the Universe flows directly from the [[Source]] of the universe, and the [[Source]] of the [[Universe]] is [[ONE]]. 

The [[Meta Authority]] _is_ the [[Source and Sustainer]] of the universe.

This is why religions have used the visual imagery of the [[Kingdom Of God]] to denote the Time and Domain in which proper authority is restored, and all [[Creation]] lives in [[Harmony]] and [[Right Relationship]] in accordance with the [[Meta Law]].  

This [[Order Of Authorities]] is implicit in the [[Logos]] of the [[Universe]].
