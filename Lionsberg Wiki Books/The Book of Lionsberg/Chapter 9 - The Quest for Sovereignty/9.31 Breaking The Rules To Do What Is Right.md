# 9.31 Breaking The Rules To Do What Is Right

As soon as the [[Hero]] embarks on the [[Critical Path]] of the [[Quest]] and begins to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] to [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]], they immediately begin to run afoul of temporal [[Authority]] and Law.

Unless the [[Hero]] understands the proper [[Order of Authority]], they will be beat back, submit to illegitimate [[Authority]], and fail on their [[Quest]].  

Because [[ONE]] is [[Perfect]], and impels us towards Perfection, the [[Spirit]] animating the [[Hero]] collides with the [[Old]] / Failing / Corrupted / Blind / Unjust structures of [[Reality]]. 

And so the [[Hero]] is compelled, again and again, to [[Break The Rules]] to do what is [[Right]].
