# 1.30 Warning 3

*"In addition to the previous warnings about the [[Suffering]] and [[Danger]] that awakening and thinking and [[Truthful Speech|Speaking Truthfully]] may bring us…"*  

*"...there is one far more serious [[Warning]] that we must pass through."*   

*"This greater danger lies in what can happen to us if we begin to [[Perceive]] and [[Understand]] what the [[Spirit]] of [[Truth]] and [[Love]] is speaking, and then [[Turn Back]] out of [[Fear]] rather than advancing in the [[Way]] and through the [[Threshold|Threshholds]] that progressively open to us."*  

*"Once we [[Perceive]] and [[Know]] that there are cracks in the [[Structure]] upon which we have founded our deepest [[Belief|Beliefs]] and [[Identity]]…"*  

*"…and when we are faced with the profound implications of admitting that…"*    

*"…if we [[Turn Back]] in [[Fear]] and re-cling to that which we now [[Know]] is not entirely [[True]] in order to save our former life, home, relationships, or positions in a false ideological hierarchy…"*  

*"…we betray the [[Spirit]] that is beckoning us forward and guiding the transformation of our [[Spirit]] and [[Soul]], which is the same [[Spirit]] that is guiding the universal transformation of our lives and our World, which is the same [[Spirit]] of the [[One]] through Whom [[All]] thing are created and sustained."  

*"Every other [[Sin]] can be [[Forgiveness|Forgiven]], [[At-One-Ment|Atoned]] for, and set right."* 

*"However the [[Conscious]] and [[Continual]] betrayal of the [[Spirit]] of [[Truth]] will destroy us."* 

*"Every time we reach a moment of [[Truth]] and betray it, we become more and more the kind of being who betrays the [[Truth]]."*  

*"If there is a [[Patterns of Death|Pattern of Death]] that will lead us to plumb the depths of [[Suffering]] and [[Chaos]], it is the [[Conscious]] and habitual betrayal of the [[Spirit]] of [[Truth]]."*  

*"Remember, we are venturing out on a dangerous [[Quest]] into the [[Unknown]]. If we cannot [[Navigate]], we will get [[Lost]] and [[Perish]]."*   

*"[[Truth]] is our [[Compass]] and our [[Guide]]."*   

*"It is our [[North Star]]."* 

*"It is that which never changes."*

*"It is the [[Reference Point]] by which we calibrate our Instruments."* 

*"It is [[Reality]]."* 

*"If you lose touch with [[Truth]], you lose touch with the [[Light]]."* 

*"If you corrupt the [[Truth]], you corrupt your inner [[Compass]]."* 

*"If you corrupt your inner [[Compass]], you will get lost and perish."* 

*"If we lose touch with the [[Light]] and corrupt our [[Compass]], we will lose the [[Way]], and soon, we will be [[Alone]], in the [[Darkness]], in the [[Unknown]], [[Lost]] and [[Disoriented]], having ventured far from the upward Path towards [[Destiny]], and having potentially so damaged our [[Inner Compass]] that we will Perish wandering in circles through the [[Chaos]] that overwhelms and encompasses us."* 

**SO DO NOT READ ON…**

**DO NOT VENTURE ON…** 

**DO NOT CROSS THROUGH THIS FINAL WARNING SIGN…**

*"…unless and until you are willing to embark and never turn back from the epic [[Quest]] to follow the [[Golden Thread]] of [[Truth]] towards [[Destiny]] through [[Love]], no matter where it may lead."* 

*"It will lead us face to face with our [[Deepest Fears]] and [[Worst Nightmares]]."* 

*"However perhaps we are destined to [[Become]] the kinds of Beings who are not imprisoned and held captive by [[Fear]]."* 

*"Perhaps we are destined to [[Become]] the kinds of Beings who forever reject [[The Illusion Of Permanent Security]], and embrace the reality that our only [[True]] [[Security]] lies in our combined [[Strength]], [[Competence]], and ability to face into and [[Contend]] with the [[Unknown]], in [[Eternal]] and perpetual [[Partnership]] with [[One]] and [[One Another]]."* 

*"If the [[One]] is on our side, what could possibly stand in our [[Way]] and prevail?"* 

*"In light of the [[Reality]] that there will always be a proverbial [[Serpent]] in any [[Walled Garden]] that we forge for ourselves, perhaps instead of making our [[Selves]] [[Safe]] we need to make our [[Selves]] and [[Strong]], so that no matter what [[Existential Threat]] or [[Fear]] manifests itself to us, we can grapple with it and overcome it together."* 

*"On the other side of [[Becoming]] the kinds of transformed Beings who can [[Truthfully]] confront and overcome our [[Deepest Fears]] and [[Worst Nightmares]] is [[Liberation]], [[Sovereignty]], [[Peace]], and [[Right Relationship]] with [[All]] things and the [[One Thing]] that is the Source and Sustainer of [[All]]."*  

*"If we really allow our [[Mind]] and [[Consciousness]] to deeply, prayerfully, spiritually, intellectually, and physically ponder these realities, we will come to [[Know]] things that we will be unable to [[Unknow]], and [[Perceive]] things that we will be unable to [[Unperceive]], without betraying [[Truth]], [[Wisdom]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], and their [[Spirit]] and [[Source]]."* 

*"If we are unwilling to courageously embark on the [[Quest]] and walk in the [[Way]] towards [[Truth]] and [[The Goal]], no matter where it arises from or where it may lead, we must avert our eyes from the [[Light]] and burn this Book."* 

*"If we do so, some day after we have once again suffered long enough in the [[Bondage]] and [[Captivity]] that lies at the end of that [[Patterns of Death|Pattern of Death]], the [[Eternal]] [[Spirit]] contained herein will once again rise from the ashes, and be ready to lead us on."* 

*"Yet it would be better for us to avoid [[Voluntarily]] reentering [[Bondage]] and [[Captivity]], and the only [[Way]] to do that is to [[Voluntarily]] venture out together into the epic [[Adventure]] that lies ahead."* 

*"Come what may."* 

*"The moment has finally arrived. You last few who have courageously made it this far, it is time to cross through the [[Threshold]] and move out into the [[Reality]] that lies beyond the [[Boundary]]."*
