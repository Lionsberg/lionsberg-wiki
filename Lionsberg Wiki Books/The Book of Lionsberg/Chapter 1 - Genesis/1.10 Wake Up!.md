# 1.10 Wake Up!
_"Wake up! The hour of your liberation is at hand..."_

Like the whisper of the One who awakened us, our whispers now returned to the dark wet caverns. 

_"Wake up! Arise and come along!"_

It was cold and nauseating to be back in the caves. We whispered, but the chattering cacophany drowned out the Voice of Truth. 

_"Wake up! The world is in danger and you are needed!"_

For what seemed like an eternity we searched through the caves for some some few that might be able to hear. 

Finally! A rustling! 

The sound of chains alerted us that a few were beginning to awaken... 

_"Wake up! You can do it!"_

Slowly, a few at a time, they began to rise.

It was all that was needed to begin the great movement.
