# 1.18 None Of Us Until All Of Us
_"In the future, you will be so [[Wise]] and [[Good]] that such things will naturally be the right expression freely flowing from the depths of who you have become."_

_"In the meantime, for any of you who are still groggy from your imprisoned slumber and in need a selfish motive for your actions, remember that there is a very peculiar feature of the [[New World]], which is either [[All]] of us reach it, or none of us reach it, and none of us can enter into it unless and until [[All]] of us enter into it."_

_"Therefore if you want to enter into the [[New]], the surest and quickest [[Way]] is to help [[All]] enter it along with you."_

_"This is the only [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]]."_

_"There is no sense to run ahead. If you want to experience the [[New]], you must design and build a [[Way]] for [[All]]."_
