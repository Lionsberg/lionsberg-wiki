# 1.1 Above The Chaos

There is a Spirit that rises up and hovers over the waters of [[Chaos]] in order to rightly vanquish and guide them.  

There is a Spirit that searches the depths of the universe and [[Realizes]] what It has in [[Mind]].  

There is a Spirit that articulates [[Logos]], and thereby brings forth the [[New]] and the [[Good]] into [[Embodied]] form.  

There is an Infinite Spirit that [[Incarnates]] its [[Universal]] and [[Eternal]] [[Nature]] and [[1. Intention]] into [[Time]] and [[Space]].  

There is a [[New]] yet [[Eternal]] [[Order]] that is so [[Truthful]], [[Right]], and [[Good]], that its reign over the [[Chaos]] shall be without end.  

May we become, [[Individually]] and [[Collectively]], a living [[Embodiment]] of It.  

May only that which is [[True]] be spoken, and may the eternal words of [[Truth]] bring forth only that which is [[Good]].  

The [[Old]] is passing away.  

Behold, We are making [[All]] things [[New]].
