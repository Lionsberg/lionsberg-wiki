# 1.32 The Fear Of Hell
We held her as she sobbed. 

_"It is ok beloved, you can lay it all down and leave it behind."_  

_"I CAN'T! I CAN'T! I CAN'T!"_ she began to scream. 

Over and over and over again. Now her screams echoed throughout. 

_"Shhhhhh... be still beloved... it is ok... please try to be quieter. It is critical that we get at least a few more through the [[Boundary]] before the Authorities attack. It is ok, you are safe and you are loved."_

And that it was only by affirming their propositions, saying their prayer of salvation, subordinating our spiritual and intellectual will to their authority, and paying them money that we could be saved from eternal conscious torment in a lake of fire that would continuously sear our skin off in the pure darkness, with it eternally growing back so that it could be burned off again._
