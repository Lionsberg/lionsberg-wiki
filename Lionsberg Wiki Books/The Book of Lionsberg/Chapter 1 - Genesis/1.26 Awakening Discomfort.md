# 1.26 Awakening Discomfort
_"We made it past the first Warning."_

_"Are we still together? Or did you turn back?"_ 

_"Are you uncomfortable yet?"_ 

_"It is ok to feel uncomfortable."_  

_"Rest with it. Experience it. Do not run from it. Do not shy away from it. Reach out. Touch it. It will not hurt you. What does it feel like?"_ 

_"We should feel uncomfortable. We are entering somewhere [[New]]."_ 

_"We haven’t been here together before."_ 

_"In due course we will learn more about [[Why]] our emotions impact us as they do."_ 

_"For now, just understand that as we venture out beyond the [[Boundary]] of the feeble light that was cast from the fire in the center of the [[Old]], it is ok to feel terrified."_ 

_"It is where we have been told that all our worst [[Fears]] dwell."_ 

_"It is indeed [[Dangerous]] out there."_ 

_"But it is [[Good]]."_ 

_"Look ahead. There is a second Warning we must pass though."_
