# 1.7 Piercing Eternal Truth In The Midst Of Lies
Entering back into the [[Cave]], we must recognize that the environment is inherently a viscous sea of lies, deception and propaganda, mindlessly spewing forth from the decaying Authorities and their captives. 

Against this backdrop, it is no small task for [[Truth]] to inbreak, illuminate and recontextualize the whole of the past, present, and future of the universe and our existence.

Inside the Caves, the available words to speak of the [[Most Important Things]] that are critical to our survival and flourishing have been co-opted and weaponized to keep the captives triggered, fearful, asleep, and divided. 

Yet somewhere within, deep within, no matter how buried they might be, the [[True]] concepts and ideas are universally known. Even by those who are asleep. 

The [[Light]] of eternal [[Truth]] will always be strong enough pierce and shatter the [[Darkness]]. 

The [[Light]] of [[Truth]] issues forth like a sword from our mouths when we speak it. 

It is a Divine weapon, capable of tearing down the mightiest fortresses of darkness. 

But it must be spoken! It is the [[Truthfully]] articulated [[Logos]] that will bring forth the [[New Era]].
