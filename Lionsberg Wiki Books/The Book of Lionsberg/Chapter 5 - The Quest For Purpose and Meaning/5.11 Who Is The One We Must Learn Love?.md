# 5.11 Who Is The One We Must Learn Love?

Who is the one we must learn to [[Love]]? 

_Love [[ONE]], and Love your Neighbor as your Self._ 

_Love [[ONE]], and [[Love]] [[All]]._

We must learn to [[Love]] [[ONE]]. 

We must learn to [[Love]] [[All]]...  

..."_as your Self_". 

If we must learn to [[Love]] [[All]] as we [[Love]] our [[Self]], who is this [[Self]] we must learn to [[Love]]? 

It is perhaps just as great of an inexhaustible mystery as the [[ONE]] and the [[All]]. 

_Know Thyself._

The [[Way]] towards the [[ONE]] is within you.  

The Kingdom of Heaven is within you. 

Can you remember [[Who We Are]]?
