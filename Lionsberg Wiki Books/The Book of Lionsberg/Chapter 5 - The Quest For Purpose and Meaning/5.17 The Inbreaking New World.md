# 5.17 The Inbreaking New World

As we [[Become]], we [[Become]] conduits through which the [[New World]] Inbreaks into every moment in which we are present, displacing the [[Old World]] as it passes away.
Â 
The [[Old World]] is only present where we do not have enough conduits displacing it with the power of the [[ONE]]. The [[Old World]] cannot stand or remain in presence of transformational [[Love]], just as [[Darkness]] cannot remain in the presence of [[Light]].
