# 5.22 Starting With The Source Of Time And Energy

If our [[New System]] and [[New]] [[Way]] is to be totally harmonized with the [[Living System]], [[ONE]], and [[All]]... 

…and totally optimized to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]…
 
…then we must think and design very deeply, returning all the way back beyond our [[Being]] and [[Doing]], to their [[Source]]. 

What is [[Space]]? What is [[Time]]? What [[Being]]? 

Where is the Ancient Foundation? 

What is the [[Source]] from which [[All]] arises? 

What is the [[Meta Intention]]? What is the [[Meta Goal]]?  

Return to the [[ONE]]. 

Start with [One]. 

Progress with [[ONE]]. 

End with [[ONE]].  

Start with the absolute and eternal abundance of [[Time]] and [[Energy]] that we are freely given with every moment and every breath. 

Then, step by step, one by one, begin aligning seconds and breaths to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].   

If it is not producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]], do not spend a second or a breath in that way. 

The [[Way]] is to [[Co-Create]] [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] in Divine partnership with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

This is the [[Way]] towards [[Purpose]] and [[Meaning]]. 

This is the [[Way]] we begin to optimize each unit of [[Time]], [[Energy]], Breath, and [[Life]] to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] via a [[New System]] entirely harmonized with the [[ONE]] and the [[Living System]] flowing from It. 
  
This will need to be a very Wise and comprehensive design indeed. 

Perfectly consistent with the Highest Intention and Goal, from highest level concept, to lowest level detail; from the [[Source]] of [[Time]] and [[Energy]], through [[Time]] and [[Energy]], through our [[Way]] of [[Being]] and [[Becoming]], expressed into our [[Doing]], in order to bring about [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]], for the benefit of [[All]] past, present, and future generations of [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]]. 

This is the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

This is the [[Way]] towards greatest [[Purpose]] and [[Meaning]]. 

This is the [[Way]] towards the [[ONE]]. 

This is the Ancient yet [[Eternal]] [[Way]]. 

*Walk ye in it.*
