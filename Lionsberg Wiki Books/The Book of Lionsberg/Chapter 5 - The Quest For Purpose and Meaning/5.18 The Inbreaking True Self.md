# 5.18 The Inbreaking True Self

In a similar way, the [[True Self]] emerges by [[Inbreak And Displace|Inbreaking and Displacing]] the [[False Self]], which is passing away. 

The [[New]] inbreaks and displaces the [[Old]]. 

The [[False Self]] cannot stand or remain in the presence of transformational [[Love]].

Transformational [[Love]] flows from [[ONE]] [[Source]]. 

Like living water clearing away blockages, with each and every bit of the [[Old]] that is displaced and washed away, more and more of the [[New]] can flow through us. 

Eventually, we are consummately present, as a conduit of [[Spirit]] of the [[ONE]], eliminating the [[Old]], so that the [[New]] can flow into our [Reality]. 

The [[Old]] is dispelled by the [[New]] like [[Darkness]] is dispelled by the [[Light]]. 

The [[True Self]] is Inbreaking and [[Becoming]] our [[Reality]].
