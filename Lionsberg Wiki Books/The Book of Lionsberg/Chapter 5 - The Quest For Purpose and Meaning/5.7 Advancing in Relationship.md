# 5.7 Advancing in Relationship

Choosing the most epic, meaningful, significant [[Quest]] we can possibly conceive of towards the Highest and [[Most Worthy Goal]] sets us out on an adventure that we should not attempt alone. 

The meaningfulness of our work is amplified by the meaningfulness of our relationships. 

The meaningfulness of our relationships all comes back to the same thing. 

[[Right Relationship]] is [[Love]]. 

If we [[Love]] [[One Another]], we will [[Help]] [[One Another]]. 

Towards what? 

Towards [[Where We Are Going]].

Away from pain and suffering, and towards [[The Goal]].   

Can you imagine a [[Community]] in which every one was helping every one advance towards [[Where We Are Going]]…

…and in which [[Where We Are Going]] is [[One]]? 

Recognizing that we can’t succeed alone, gather up those around you, and take on as much [[Responsibility]] as you can bear for the success of your team, your community, and All generations of Life, and move with the full force of your Being towards the [[Goal]]!
 
Measure your [[Progress]], [[Get A Little Better Every Day]], and continuously elevate your performance as the challenges and obstacles of the [[Quest]] transform you towards your [[Potential]]. 

The growth, development, and Realization can only come through [[Progress]]. True [[Progress]] can only come in [[Community]]. And true [[Community]] can only be found in a place of [[Right Relationship]].
