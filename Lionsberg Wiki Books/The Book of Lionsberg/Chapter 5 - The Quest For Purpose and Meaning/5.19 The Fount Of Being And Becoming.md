# 5.19 The Fount Of Being And Becoming

What is the [[Source]] of the Living Water that longs to [[Flow]] through us and bring forth the [[New]]? 

Is it not the [[ONE]]? 

Is it not the Fount of [[All]] [[Being]] and [[Becoming]]? 

Is not the [[Source]] of these Living Waters also the [[Source]] of the [[Purpose]], the [[Meaning]], the [[Progress]], and [[The Goal]]? 

Are not the Wellsprings of [[All]] [[ONE]]? 

Can we see yet that it is [[All]] [[ONE]], flowing from [[ONE]], through [[ONE]], and to [[ONE]]?
