# 5.3 The Purpose And Meaning Of Life

The great question: What is the [[Purpose]] and [[Meaning]] of [[Life]]? 

The Answer has been expressed by a thousand prophets and poets in a thousand different languages, in a thousand different ways. 

Yet in the end, the Answers all point to [[One Thing]]. 

The Answers are all [[ONE]]. 
 
We are here to [[Love]], to [[Become]], and to [[Serve]]. 

We are here to [[Elevate And Transform]] our [[Selves]] and our World. 

We are here to Progress towards [[The Goal]] of the [[ONE]], and help [[All]] others do the same. 

For in the end, we are here to [[Realize]] that there are no "others", and that [[All]] are flowing from and progressing back towards [[ONE]] through [[ONE]].  

Therefore the Purpose and Meaning is to Progress towards Perfect Oneness through Perfect Love. 

All Purpose and Meaning are One, and One is [[Love]].
