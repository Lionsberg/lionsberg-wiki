# 5.15 Transformation and Emergence

How do we [[Become]]? 
 
[[Becoming]] is a never ending process of [[Transformation]]. 

It is a continual death of the [[False Self]] and a continual resurrection of the [[True Self]]. 

It is a continual death of the [[Old]] and a continual resurrection of the [[New]]. 

It is a continual [[Co-Creation]] or filling up of what is lacking, and a removal or destruction of all that is not intended to be here now. 

It is a continual [[Re-Creation]] of the [[New]], and purging of the [[Old]]. 

It is a continual application of the transformational [[Patterns of Life]], and shedding of the [[Patterns of Death]].
 
It is an ongoing rediscovery and fulfillment of the unique and inherent [[Potential]] that is already within us and longing to [[Emerge]]. 

You would not be longing for it, if it was not within you and able to be [[Realized]].
