# 5.20 The Fallacy of 90-10

The builders of the [[Old World]] built an [[Old System]] in which approximately 90% of all human activity was [[Waste]] that clogged the System and hindered throughput of [[The Goal]]. 
 
They chained them [[All]] to the system, and goaded them on. 

They then encouraged them to give 10% of their time, energy, and resources to try to fix the problems they were creating with 90% of their energy, and told them this was the source of eternal meaning and salvation. 
 
Only the very religious or generous actually gave 10%. 

Most were far too distracted or desperate. 

In reality, the total system ended up with about 2% of the energy and resources attempting to treat the symptoms and injustices created by 98% of the energy and resources. 
 
In hindsight, this was not a wise or logical design. 

Yet it was nearly impossible to see from within the matrix. 

It was only in retrospect, looking back from [[Beyond]], that these things become horrendously apparent.

How had we been so blind? 

How had we been so deceived?
