# 5.8 All For One, And One For All

The spiritually-and-logically-obvious-yet-intentionally-and-dreadfully-concealed [[Truth]] is that none of us can reach [[The Goal]] unless and until [[All]] of us reach [[The Goal]]. 
 
We are all on the same vessel, and we all end up where it takes us. It is indivisible. We are indivisible. We [[All]] are one.  
 
None of us can truly discover or achieve our [[Potential]] unless and until [[All]] of us discover and achieve our [[Potential]]. 
 
We are one eternal and universal family of [[Life]].
 
The only logical orientation is to become [[All]] For [[ONE]], and [[ONE]] For [[All]].
