# 5.21 The Truth Of The 10-90

Observers of systems have developed a heuristic that 80 to 90 percent of the real results come from 10 to 20 percent of the inputs or causes. 
Â 
As we grow in our understanding of the Goal, we will need to grow in our focus on the 10 to 20 percent of inputs which are actually producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

It is here, at the [[Critical Chain]], that must direct our [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]]. 

We must progressively realign our time, energy, and resources so that they are 90% focused on that which produces [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]]. 

With the remainder, we can rest, recreate, procreate, and play. 

If something is not producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]], it is [[Waste]]. 

[[Waste]] must be progressively eliminated. 

Perhaps we will find out that the vast majority of our [[Doing]] is Harming rather than Helping us and [[All]]. 

If we stop [[Doing]] what is Harming, we will have far more [[Time]] and [[Energy]] to Be and Do in a far more Meaningful and Purposeful [[Way]].
