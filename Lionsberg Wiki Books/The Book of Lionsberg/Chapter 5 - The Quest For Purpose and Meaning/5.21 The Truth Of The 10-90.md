# 5.21 The Truth Of The 10-90

Observers of systems have developed a heuristic that 80 to 90 percent of the real results come from 10 to 20 percent of the inputs or causes. 
 
As we grow in our understanding of the Goal, we will need to grow in our focus on the 10 to 20 percent of inputs which are actually producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

It is here, at the [[Critical Chain]], that must direct our [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]]. 

We must progressively realign our time, energy, and resources so that they are 90% focused on that which produces [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]]. 

With the remainder, we can rest, recreate, procreate, and play. 

If something is not producing [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]], it is [[Waste]]. 

[[Waste]] must be progressively eliminated. 

Perhaps we will find out that the vast majority of our [[Doing]] is Harming rather than Helping us and [[All]]. 

If we stop [[Doing]] what is Harming, we will have far more [[Time]] and [[Energy]] to Be and Do in a far more Meaningful and Purposeful [[Way]].
