# 5.6 Choosing the Meta Goal

We are repeating this in each chapter for a reason, for it is the [[One Thing]], that if we get it right, will cause all other things to be added unto us. 

_Do not worry... only seek First the (Kingdom of God), and all these things will be added unto you._ 

Since the amount of [[Meaning]] we will experience if life is directly proportional to the [[Quality]] / [[Value]] / [[Worthiness]] of the [[Goal]] we are progressing towards, why consciously choose anything short of the [[Most Worthy Goal]]? 

There is only [[ONE]]. 

The only suitable object of the [[Quest]] is the proverbial “Holy Grail”. 

The only suitable object of the [[Meta Quest]], by strict definition, is the [[Meta Goal]]. 

It is not a philosophical or spiritual or religious. It is a matter of definition. 
 
The [[Meta Goal]] is the [[Meta Object]] of the [[Meta Quest]], which can only be from, towards, and through [[ONE]]. 
 
Each of these is the highest order one of its kind, and all the highest order things of all kinds are united by [[One Thing]].
