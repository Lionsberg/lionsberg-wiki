# 4.34 Towards Perfect Oneness, Through Perfect Love

We now have enough basic alignment in our [[Story]], [[Intention]], and [[Goal]] to be able to [[Perceive]] and [[Navigate]] together. 

If you ever get lost along the [[Way]], come back to the present moment and remember that we are simply [[Doing Our Best]] to [[Navigate]] towards Perfect [[Oneness]] through Perfect [[Love]]. 

We are navigating towards [[ONE]] through [[Love]]. 

We are navigating towards [[Love]] through [[Love]].

We are on the [[Meta Quest]] towards the [[Meta Goal]]. 

It is all [[ONE]]. [[ONE]] is the beginning. [[ONE]] is the end. [[ONE]] is the [[Way]]. [[ONE]] is [[The Goal]]. 

If you ever get lost, return to [[ONE]], and your feet will be back firmly on the only [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]].  

It is impossible to get lost when your Goal and your Way are One.
