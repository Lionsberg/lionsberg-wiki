# 4.2 Continually Transforming Conscious Agents
Key to the  [[Navigation Issue]] is the understanding that as [[Conscious Agent|Conscious Agents]] perpetually in motion towards our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], we are continually moving and interacting with the [[Reality]] that manifests itself to us along our [[Way]]. 

The subset of [[Reality]] that manifests itself to us depends on [[What Matters]]. [[What Matters]] depends on [[Who We Are]], our [[Goal]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]]. 

When a subset of [[Reality]] manifests itself to us, we [[Interact]] with it. 

When we [[Interact]] with [[Reality]], we transform it, and it transforms us. 

When we enter each subsequent moment, neither we nor our [[Reality]] are the same as they were the moment before. 

This is because we are ourselves a Conscious Living System that exists in a broader and inherently inter-existent and inter-transforming Conscious Living System.  

What we do to the [[Reality]] that we are nested within, we literally do to ourselves. 

We are continually transforming Conscious Agents within One interexistent, interactive, Conscious Reality that is reciprocally opening through our inter-action. 

At least that is our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the [[Story]].
