# 4.33 Away From Pain, Towards Flourishing

Lest all that be confusing, we could also simply say that we should [[Navigate]] away from [[Pain]] and [[Suffering]] and towards flourishing and abundant life, and Help [[All]] others do the same. 

When the Voice speaks, it eternally beckons us up and out of our present mire. 

Out of slavery. 

Out of suffering.  

Out of oppression. 

For [[All]] are [[Loved]] by [[ONE]], and [[The Goal]] of [[All]] is [[ONE]].  

What if we tuned the fullness of our [[Being]] and [[Doing]] to produce [[Throughput]] of that [[Goal]]?
