# 4.10 Where We Are

Here. Now. 

Wherever we find ourselves. 

In this time. In this place. In this present moment. 

Right here, in the infinite now, that is our interface to eternity. 

We are two places simultaneously. 

We are in the infinite and non-temporal. 

And we are here. Now. 

Do not confuse which is more real. 

Do not confuse what you see through your [[Spacetime User Interface]] for the underlying [[Reality]].  

There is far more. Deeper.
