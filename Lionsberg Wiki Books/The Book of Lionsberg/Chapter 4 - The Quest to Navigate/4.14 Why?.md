# 4.14 Why? 

[[Love]]. 

The most powerful force on earth is [[Why]]. The most powerful force force on earth is what impels us on. 

If we [[Love]] [[ONE]] and [[All]], if we [[Love]] our [[Selves]], if we [[Love]] [[One Another]], if we [[Love]]... if we [[Love]]... if we [[Love]]... if we [[Love]]... 

If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... If we [[Love]]... 

That is worth meditating on forever. If we [[Love]]... if we were [[Love]]... if we embodied [[Love]]... if we truly embodied the living Spirit of the [[ONE]] Who is [[Love]]... 

Oh how the depths of the universe would rise up through us and move heaven and earth to seek, to save, to Love, to serve the [[ONE]] and the [[All]].  

Even if it cost us our life! 

Every logic, every how, every why, everything ought, can be derived from [[ONE]] word. From [[ONE]] thought. From [[ONE]] Spirit, which IS [[Love]]. 

[[ONE]]. [[Love]].  

They are [[ONE]]. They are [[Why]]. They are the [[Goal]]. They are the [[Way]]. They are the [[Spirit]].
