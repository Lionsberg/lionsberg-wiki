# 4.8 The Conscious Choice of One's Intention and Goal

The [[Conscious]] Choice of One’s [[Intention]] and [[Goal]].  

Thousands of years of spiritual, philosophical, building, manufacturing, and technology learnings have offered us a very interesting solution to this first moral decision. 

That solution is to transform the sentence above to: 

The [[Conscious]] Choice of [[ONE|One’s]] [[Intention]] and [[Goal]]. 

If both ethically and pragmatically we must choose an [[Aim]] as a prerequisite to proper [[Perception]]… 

… and if that chosen [[Aim]] will determine the subset of [[Reality]] that manifests itself to us… 

…and if that subset of [[Reality]] is what we will transform and be transformed by… 

The only rational choice is, to greatest extent possible, to harmonize and unify our individual [[Intention]] and [[Goal]] with the [[Intention]] and [[Goal]] of the [[ONE]].   

The only rational choice is to choose the One [[Highest Intention]], [[Greatest Good]], and [[Greatest Goal]].  

Intentionally choosing anything lower is a conscious decision to separate ourselves from the [[ONE]] and thereby literally distort our [[Perception]] of [[Reality]].   

The reunification of our [[Spirit]], [[Consciousness]], [[Intention]], [[Aim]], [[Goal]], [[Will]], [[Volition]], [[Agency]], [[Values]]… with those same elements of the [[ONE]]… progressively and to the greatest degree possible over [[Time]]… is the One and Only [[Way]] towards the highest possible integration, coherence, integrity, and [[Realization]] available to us. 

By harmonizing our [[Intention]] and [[Goal]] with the [[Intention]] and [[Goal]] of the [[ONE]], [[What Matters]] to us will be [[What Matters]] to the [[ONE]].  

The result of this conscious ethical decision is that when we [[Perceive]] and [[Interact]], we will be [[Interacting]] with [[Reality]] as it were on behalf of or in service of the [[ONE]].   

We become [[Conscious Agents]] of the [[Ultimate]] [[Conscious Agent]]. 

We become [[Co-Creators]] of that which the [[Ultimate]] [[Creator]] Intends.  

And because we are All harmonizing our Selves to [[One Thing]], we are harmonizing our [[Selves]] not only with [[ONE]], but with [[One Another]] and [[All]].
