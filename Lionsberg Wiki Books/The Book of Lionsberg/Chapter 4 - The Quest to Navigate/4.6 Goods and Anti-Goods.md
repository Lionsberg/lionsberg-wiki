# 4.6 Goods and Anti-Goods
The critical Navigation #principle is that: 

1) The tiny subset of infinite [[Reality]] that manifests itself to us is entirely dependent upon our [[Goal]]. 

2) What we [[Perceive]] as [[Good]] or [[Anti-Good]], Helpful or Harmful, [[Tools]] or [[Anti-Tools]] is entirely dependent upon our [[Goal]], and how it orders within itself our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. 

3) There is by definition only one [[Meta Goal]] / [[Meta Good]] that can properly cohere within itself and order the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] / Goods.
