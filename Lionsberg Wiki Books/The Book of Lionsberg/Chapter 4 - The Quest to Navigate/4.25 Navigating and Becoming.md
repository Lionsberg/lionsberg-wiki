# 4.25 Navigating and Becoming

So it is that our [[Way]] of [[Navigating]] together towards [[The Goal]] is one with our [[Way]] of elevating, transforming, and [[Becoming]]…

It is all an act of [[Co-Creation]]. 

And we can’t do it alone. 

If we can’t do it alone, we must do it together. 

In partnership with [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]]. 

This is the only [[Way]].  

So we must elevate, transform, and [[Become]] the kinds of Beings who are [[Co-Creators]] with [[One]] and [[One Another]].   

If we are going to [[Move]] together, we must [[Move]] towards the same [[Goal]]. 

The only [[Goal]] big enough the encompass and unite us [[All]] is the [[Meta Goal]].

The [[Meta Goal]] is for [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]] to develop towards the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish in harmony. 

Having made the moral decision to [[Move]] together towards the [[Meta Goal]], and understanding [[Who We Are]] and [[Where We Are]], and [[Who We Are Becoming]] and [[Where We Are Going]], we begin to solve the fundamental issue of [[Perception]]. 

The [[New Dawn]] begins to [[Inbreak And Displace]] the fog of our present [[Chaos]].  

Once we [[Rediscover]] how we can [[All]] [[Perceive]] [[What Matters]], we have a [[New]] [[Framework]] for how to [[Orient]] our [[Selves]] and [[Move]] together as One towards One [[Goal]]. 

Our movement towards the [[Goal]] is a process of [[Reciprocal Opening]] between [[Being]] and [[Doing]]. 

It is like an exploration, an adventure, or a [[Quest]]. 

It requires that we gather up our [[Courage]] and [[Move]] out beyond the [[Boundary]]. 

Once we can [[Move]] together, we can begin to [[Explore]] our [[New]] [[Reality]] outside the [[Boundary]]. 

Once we can [[Competently]] [[Explore]], we can begin to [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

As we [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]], we will continually encounter [[Challenges]], [[Issues]], and [[Obstacles]] that require us to [[Transform]] into a higher [[State of Being]]. 

And one by one, we will build up the individual skills, and begin to coordinate them and group them together, so we can progress from moving, to scooting, to crawling, to walking, to running, to dancing, to riding, to driving, to flying, to flying together in formation towards [[Destiny]]. 

We will become One [[Body]] that is capable of exceedingly and abundantly beyond all that we could presently conceive of.  

It all begins with becoming ever more one with [[One]] and [[One Another]].  

It all begins with the simple, eternal, universal call, from deep within, to progress [[Towards Oneness Through Love]].
