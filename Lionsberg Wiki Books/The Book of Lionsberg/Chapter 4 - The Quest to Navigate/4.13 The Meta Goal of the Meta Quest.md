# 4.13 The Meta Goal of the Meta Quest

Our [[Goal]] is [[ONE]]. 

What is [[ONE]]? 

What is the [[Highest and Best]]? 

What lies at the absolute top of the hierarchy of [[Values]] and Goods? 

What is the [[Meta Goal]] of the universal and eternal [[Meta Quest]] we are [[All]] on? 

We [[Know]] It is [[ONE]]. 

And we are always striving to [[Realize]] what It Is. 

It is. 

I am. 

We are. 

[[ONE]]. 

Whatever It is, It is [[Absolute]], It is ineffable, It is transcendent, It is [[Conscious]], It is beyond, It is within.  

It is the [[ONE]] [[Meta Goal]] of the [[Meta Quest]]. 

Living right here within us, and impelling us onward towards It, and back towards It. 

"Why are you so cryptic? We KNOW what It is - it say it right there in the Book!"  

They all Know. Therefore they are Blind. They bow down to their concretization of the Absolute, and thereby commit the greatest [[Sin]]. 

They Know. Therefore they will never be able to cross the [[Boundary]].  They will forever remain prisoners within the walls of the [[Old]]. 

Try to bottle up or box in the Goal of our noble Quest, and it will destroy you. 

[[We Do Not Know]], therefore we are on a [[Quest]] to search it out! 

This is the beginning of the [[Way]] towards [[Wisdom]].
