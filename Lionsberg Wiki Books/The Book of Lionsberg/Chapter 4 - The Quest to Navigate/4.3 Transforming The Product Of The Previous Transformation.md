# 4.3 Transforming The Product Of The Previous Transformation
It is interesting to speak about Transformation in the context of Navigation on our Quest towards [[The Goal]].  

The reason for this is that we Progress towards [[Where We Are Going]] by Progressing towards [[Who We Are Becoming]].  

It is impossible to reach out [[Destiny]] unless and until we Become [[Who We Are Becoming]]. 

As we continually elevate and transform our lives and our world, every transformation produces a new [[Being]] and a new [[Reality]] that is then subsequently acted upon and transformed. 

The pattern is (something like) one of successive transformations applied to the product of previous transformations in inter-adaptation with the surround environment. 

This slower, iterative, evolutionary transformation is the most typical pattern. This is the way things normally Progress.  

There is a different, far rarer pattern, which is a quantum leap forward towards a more optimal [[State of Being]].   

This usually occurs when a [[Living System]] has been pushed right to the edge of [[Chaos]], _but has not yet fully collapsed into it_.

If our intuition is correct about this moment in history, it would be very [[Wise]] for us to pay special attention to this quantum shift / phase change type of transformation, and to consciously prepare for it, and to determine how to participate in it and Be through it. 

We are therefore, moment by moment, continually [[Co-Create|Co-Creating]] our [[Selves]] and the [[Reality]] we experience.  

In each moment, we are a new [[Conscious Agents|Conscious Agent]] that must [[Orient]], [[Adapt]], and [[Navigate]] towards its [[Goal]].
