# 4.1 The Navigation Issue
Now that we have sorted out our basic stories, we have a [[Navigation Issue]].  

It bears repeating that if our [[Narrative Framework]] is not conceptually aligned, and if we do not conceive of our Selves on a shared [[Meta Quest]] towards the [[Meta Goal]], there is no sense trying to orient, navigate, and move together... 

...for we will not be perceiving the same subset of the universe, or heading in the same direction within it. 

However providing that we are all committed to [[Progress|Progressing]] towards [[The Goal]], and doing so in a Spirit of Love guided by our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], our next challenge is to learn to Navigate and Move together. 

This is the second key skill. 

Finding ourselves awakened out of our semi-unconscious slumber, and [[Thrown]] into a [[Perceived]] [[Time]] and [[Space]], we have to becomes skilled at continually discerning 1) [[Who We Are]] 2) [[Where We Are]] 3) [[How We Got Here]] 4) [[Where We Are Going]], and 5) [[Why]] it [[What Matters|Matters]]. 

Without knowing [[Where We Are]], [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]], we will not be able to [[Orient]] our Selves and [[Navigate]] Wisely towards [[The Goal]].  

Our understanding and capability to grapple wisely with these questions will increase over time, for in each moment, with each step of Progress, we are transforming ourselves and our [[Reality]], and becoming more and more [[Aware]].
