# 4.11 How We Got Here

It has been a long journey to get here. 

Through the most breathtaking mountain tops, the darkest valleys, and the most peaceful and serene prairies. 

Through many dangers, toils, and strains. 

It has been difficult. It has been dangerous. It has been high. It has been low. 

But what happens next is amazing. 

[[Grace]] has brought us safe this far. 

[[Grace]] will lead us on, if we let Her.
