# 4.9 Who We Are

We are the beloved creation of [[ONE]]. 

We are one family of [[God]]. 

We are [[Conscious Agents]], united in [[Vision]], [[Intention]], and [[Goal]]. 

We are the free and empowered [[Co-Creators]] of our lives and our world. 

We are the unique individual parts of One collective body.

We are the [[Agents]] of the [[ONE]] Source of All Life, Light, and Love. 

We are unique and [[Sovereign]] expressions of [[ONE]] [[Creative Consciousness]]. 

We are uniquely chosen for this moment in history.

We are one family of [[Life]], [[Light]], and [[Love]].  

We are one circle of [[Life]], [[Light]], and [[Love]].   

We are one river of [[Life]], [[Light]], and [[Love]].  

We are citizens of the One [[Universal and Eternal]] Kingdom or Nation.  

We are the rightful heirs to a collective inheritance that has been concealed from us. 

We are [[Loved]].  

We are [[Forgiven]].  

We are [[Sovereign]].  

We are [[Free]]. 

We are no longer subjugated to illegitimate [[Authority]].  

From this highest overarching and uniting shared [[Identity]], we can begin to  [[Orient]] ourselves and move towards our highest overarching and uniting [[Goal]], which is [[ONE]] for us [[All]]. 

Never forget [[Who We Are]]. 

Always remember [[Who We Are]]. 

Never forget the highest [[Identity]] that calls us [[All]] up towards [[Oneness]] through [[ONE]] [[Love]]. 

We cannot know [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]] unless we know [[Who We Are]].  

Or perhaps you have forgotten. If so, then then this is an invitation for you to remember and become who you truly are, which is [[Who We Are Becoming]].
