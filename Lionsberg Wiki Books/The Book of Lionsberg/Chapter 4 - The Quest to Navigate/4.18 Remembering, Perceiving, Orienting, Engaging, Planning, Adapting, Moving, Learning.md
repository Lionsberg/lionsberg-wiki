# 4.18 Remembering, Perceiving, Orienting, Engaging, Planning, Adapting, Moving, Learning

So we have discussed our limited [[Spacetime User Interface]] that imposes upon a universe that is for all intents and purposes infinitely complex, a highly simplified overlay at an appropriate level of analysis that allows us to interact with the underlying Reality. 

We then explored how our [[Narrative Lens]] shapes what, out of the near infinite number of things in [[Reality]] we could pay [[Attention]] to, we actually [[Perceive]]. 

We dealt with the [[Perception]] as a moral decision, rooted in the [[Narrative Framework]] we choose, and specifically, in the choice of the [[Meta Goal]] of our [[Story]]. 

So let us now assume that we find our Selves [[Thrown]] into a particular [[Place]] and [[Time]]. 

We become something like warriors or adventurers who have been dropped into a very strange, distant, and uncertain place. We understand our transformational [[Mission]] and our [[Goal]]. 

Yet we are not beginning at a beginning. We never get to start from a blank slate. We are dropped mid-way into a [[Story]] and a [[Context]] that is already unfolding in that [[Time]] and [[Space]]. 

We are like a new Avatar, dropped into a certain scene mid-way through an epic tale, and we don't know exactly what is going on around us. 

So the first thing we need to do upon landing, before we even open our eyes in [[Spacetime]], is Remember [[Who We Are]] and our [[Meta Goal]]. Because remember, that moral decision is prior to [[Perception]]. 

Second, we must become [[Consummately Present]] in the eternal [[Now]]. We know [[Who We Are]], we know [[Who We Are Becoming]], we know the [[Meta Story]], however we must strive to Remember that the [[Universal and Eternal]] Story we are living out descends and touches Earth [[Here]] and [[Now]]. In us and through us. 

Third, we must [[Orient]]. 

Fourth, we must [[Engage]]. 

Fifth, we must [[Plan]] and [[Adapt]]. 

Sixth, we must [[Move]], with the full [[Force]] of our [[Being]], towards [[The Goal]]. 

Seventh, we must Learn and Continuously Improve the [[Quality]] of each of these elements Being and Doing. 

Let's explore stage 3, [[Orienting]].
