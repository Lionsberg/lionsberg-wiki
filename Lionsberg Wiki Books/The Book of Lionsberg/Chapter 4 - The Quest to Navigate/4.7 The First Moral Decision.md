# 4.7 The First Moral Decision

It bears repeating in our discussion on Navigation, that as a result of the above: 

_The first moral decision, prior even to the act or phenomena of [[Perception]], is the [[Conscious]] choice of one’s highest overarching and uniting  [[Intention]] and [[Goal]]._ 

It is the one decision that will guide all the rest of the Way the universe manifests itself to you, and you interact with and navigate through it.
