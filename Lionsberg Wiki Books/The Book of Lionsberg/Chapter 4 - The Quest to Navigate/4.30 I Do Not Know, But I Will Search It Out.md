# 4.30 I Do Not Know, But I Will Search It Out

The precondition to [[Wisdom]], [[Understanding]], and [[Knowledge]] is admitting [[We Do Not Know]]. 

In the [[Meta Science]], everything is a [[Hypothesis]].  

Our deepest convictions are only our [[Current Best Understanding]].  

If we are ever to open up the possibility of Knowing, every semantic proposition and articulation that we have clung to for certainty must be laid down.

Every petrified or stagnant place must be loosened and made to [[Flow]] again. 

Loose, flowing, supremely confident in nothing but [[One]]. 

It is from this place that we can freely confess the great unifying statement, the [[One Thing]] we [[All]] know for certain: 

[[We Do Not Know]]. 

It is not until we admit that we do not know, that the possibility of Knowing reemerges.  

And when the possibility of Knowing reemerges, and yet is [[Beyond]] our grasp, it calls us up into the greatest adventure and search. 

A [[Quest]] towards [[Truth]]. 

A [[Quest]] towards [[Wisdom]]. 

A [[Quest]] towards the [[Source]] of [[Truth]] and [[Wisdom]]. 

A [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]].  

A [[Quest]] towards the [[One]].  

*“I do not know, but I will search it out.”* 

This is the watchword of the Wise.
