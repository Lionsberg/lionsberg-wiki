# 4.12 Where We Are Going

We are going towards our [[Goal]].  

We are shooting towards our [[Aim]].  

Towards the [[Highest and Best]] we can presently conceive. 

Towards the fullness of our [[Potential]]. 

Towards the fullness of All's [[Potential]]. 

Towards the [[Source]] of All [[Potential]]. 

There can only be [[One]] Goal if we are [[All]] going to go there together as One Body.
