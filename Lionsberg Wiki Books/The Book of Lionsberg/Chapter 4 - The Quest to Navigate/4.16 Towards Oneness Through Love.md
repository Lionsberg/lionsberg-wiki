# 4.16 Towards Oneness Through Love

At the absolute top of the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] is [[One]] that contains within itself, orders, and gives rise to [[All]] that is Valuable and [[Good]]. 

This [[Unity]] is the [[Goal]]. This [[Unity]] is the [[One]]. 

[[One]] is beckoning us towards [[Oneness]] with [[One]] and [[All]]. 

This [[Unity]] is what we are [[Navigating]] towards. 

We move towards [[It]] through [[Love]], for [[It]] is [[Love]]. 

[[Love]] is the only [[Way]] towards [[Love]].  

The [[Way]] is the [[Goal]]. 

The [[Way]] and the [[Goal]] are [[One]]. 

[[One]] is [[Love]]. 

There is only [[One]] answer to the equation, and It is [[Love]].  

Follow me! Let us progress towards [[Oneness]] through [[Love]], by helping [[All]] do the same.
