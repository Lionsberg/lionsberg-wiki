# 13.3 What Beckons Beyond

There is something [[Beyond]] [[The Boundary]]. There is *something more* beckoning. Out beyond the walls of safety, security, and structure, danger and opportunity beckon. Life beckons. The very keys to our life and survival, guarded by the terror that can destroy us.

The whispers can be hard to discern. Sometimes it is the [[Spirit]] that creates order out of chaos that is beckoningâ€¦ the voice of the [[Potential]] that lies beyond the holy grail. And sometimes it is the spirit that creates chaos out of order. Sometimes it is the snake in the garden; the dragon guarding the grail that is hell-bent on our destruction, and through which we must pass.
