# 13.33 Why Us?

It has to be Us, the rising global Community, because there is no “them” that can save “us”. There is only us. 

The massive and positive transformation of our lives and our world logically cannot be led by any institution or oligarchy. 

It must spring forth a rising, united, and empowered grassroots Community. 

Everyone of us, today, can arise and set our own feet on the path, and begin helping everyone around us do the same.

As it has been prophesied, *we are the ones we have been waiting for.*
