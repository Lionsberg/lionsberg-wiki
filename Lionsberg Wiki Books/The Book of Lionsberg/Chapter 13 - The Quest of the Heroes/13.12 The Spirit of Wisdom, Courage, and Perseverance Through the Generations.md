# 13.12 The Spirit of Wisdom, Courage, and Perseverance Through the Generations

This is not just about our own individual transformation.

It is about the ultimate transformation of the human species and [[All Creation]] guided by the the Wisdom and Spirit of God as all generations of life and consciousness progress through the millennia towards their [[Destiny]].

Therefore [[Courage]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Perseverance]] must transcend any current embodiment of them.

[[The Flame]] must ever be passed to the next generation as our legacy, their inheritance.

There is the individual spirit of the [[Phoenix]], that is like the [[Spirit of Christ]].

And there is the collective and universal spirit of the [[Phoenix]], which is like the [[Spirit of God]]. 

They are [[ONE]]. 

*Because we were old, corrupt, and lacked faith, a generation had to perish in the desert before all generations could flourish in the [[Land Of Promise]]. May this not be Our Story this time around.*
