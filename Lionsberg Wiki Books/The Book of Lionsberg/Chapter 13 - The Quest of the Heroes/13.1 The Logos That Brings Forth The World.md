# 13.1 The Logos That Brings Forth The World

[[Logos]] is an amazing word.

It relates to the fundamental generative principle of the universe, to Truthful speech, and to the perfect Divine Wisdom and Intention.

It is a deep concept to consider the spoken [[Truth]] that brings [[Order]] out of [[Chaos]] and overcomes [[Evil]] with [[Good]].

The spoken Truth that calls forth [[What Ought To Be]] out of [[What Is]], and destroys what ought not to be.

It is the properly articulated Word that properly articulates the world.

This is the [[New Yet Eternal]] Language that the heroes learn to speak.
