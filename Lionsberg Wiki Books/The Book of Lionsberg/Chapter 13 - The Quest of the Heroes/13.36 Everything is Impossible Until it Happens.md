# 13.36 Everything is Impossible Until it Happens

All the great achievements and moments in human history seemed impossible until they occurred. Miracles always seem impossible until they are witnessed. Everything is impossible until it happens.

There is an entire universe of [[Potential]], which belongs to the class of things that we will never know if they were possible, until we die trying.  

Let us suspend judgment and belief for a time about what is possible and impossible, and start moving together on the Quest towards what lies [[Beyond]] the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good of Which We Can Presently Conceive]].
