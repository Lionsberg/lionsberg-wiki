# 11.32 Success in the Meta Game

Recognizing that the [[Meta Goal]] is beyond our ability to conceptualizeâ€¦

... and that [[We Do Not Know]] the [[Upper Limit]] of our [[Potential]]... 

Success in the [[Meta Game|Meta Game]] becomes something like a process, rather than an outcome... it becomes something like the [[Progressive Realization]] of the [[Most Worthy Goal]] or Ideal. 

Success is a matter of [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]], not attainment.

It is a matter of [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] into reality.

Our [[Meta Game|Meta Game]] should therefore be designed as a higher order System, that integrates the energy, resources, and ability of all players of the game, into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]], that produces [[Throughput]] of the [[Meta Goal]], FROM [[Potential]] INTO [[Reality]].

It becomes about Consciously Selecting, from among all possible Potentials, the [[Best And Highest]] One, and bringing it into [[Reality]], while humbly recognizing that it can be known by us - only navigated towards. 

Success in the infinite game is defined by meaningful progress towards the most meaningful Goal, which is God.
