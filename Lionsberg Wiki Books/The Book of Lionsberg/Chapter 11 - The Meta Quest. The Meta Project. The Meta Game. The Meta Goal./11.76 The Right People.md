# 11.76 The Right People

It is the right people, with the right integrity, who determine the success or failure of any prototype or society.

We must be exceedingly wise and discerning in who we relate with and how.

Do not be deceived by words, but look to the fruit and the results. You know a tree by its fruit.

Find those already bearing good fruit around the world, with good roots that are already growing. Cultivate, strengthen, empower, and spread the best of what is working and bearing fruit.

Patiently try to heal, but be willing to uproot that which is not bearing fruit so that New Life can emerge and flourish in its place.

Corrupt or fruitless trees have no place in the garden of the [[New World]].
