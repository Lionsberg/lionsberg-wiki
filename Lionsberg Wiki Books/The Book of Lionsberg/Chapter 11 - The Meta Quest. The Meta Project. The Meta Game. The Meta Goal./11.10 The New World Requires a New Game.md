# 11.10 The New World Requires a New Game

How far removed this Vision is from the false dream in which we have been asleep. 

How far removed is this Reality from [[The Caves]] in which we have been shackled and kept. 

We cannot be fully alive in any of the [[Old]] games we were imprisoned in.

When we awaken and rediscover our true identity, our sovereignty, our authority, and our responsibility, we move.

And when we move, we move together, towards [[ONE]] intention. Towards [[ONE]] Goal. 

And as we attempt to move, we immediately discover that none of the [[Old]] self-optimizing games is compatible with the [[New]] Game that optimizes for [[ONE]] and [[All]].

The [[New World]] requires a New Game.

If you try to put a [[New World]] into an [[Old]] game, they will both be ruined. 

New Wine must be poured into New Wineskins.
