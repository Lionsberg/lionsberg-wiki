# 11.16 The Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals and Loves

The [[Way]] we structure and properly order our [[Relationships]] and [[Goals]] is inherently, inextricably, and by its very nature *the* values-based moral decision that every human being must make.

At any given time we have a variety of [[Sub Personalities]] moving towards divergent goals and vying for control of the mainframe of our being. These range from the most primal drives towards food, water, and shelter, to romance and sex, to relationships and community, to the higher order goals relating to purpose, meaning, fulfillment, spiritual enlightenment and [[Right Relationship]].

Out of the [[Infinite Storehouse]] of [[Potential]] [[Goals]], identities, and orientations, we must [[Consciously Choose]] the primary Goal and [[Identity]] that we orient ourselves towards and manifest into [[Reality]].

This is inherently a matter of discerning, out of the infinite potential of things we could pursue, what potential goals have the highest relative [[Value]] / [[Worth]] to move towards.

Because we cannot select for only one, we are forced to construct a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], so that we can have loving relationships, amazing sex and great food while elevating and transforming our lives and our world.

This requires us to integrate a total [[Personality]], properly functioning in pursuit of a properly ordered [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. 

A fully enlightened, conscious, integrated personality is one that has [[Properly Ordered]] itself, harmonized itself, and brought all its constituent parts into right relationship, and then properly harmonized this new [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] into [[Right Relationship]] and [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with nature, society, and the [[One]] from which [[All]] things flow.

Likewise, as we move up the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Abstraction]], a fully enlightened, conscious, integrated [[Society]] is one that has properly ordered itself, harmonized itself, and brought all its constituent parts into [[Right Relationship]], and then properly harmonized this new functional unity into right relationship and functional unity with nature and the [[One]] from which society and nature flow.

As we discuss elsewhere, this order of relationships and goals will nearly entirely shape the [[Way]] that the universe manifests itself to us, in us, and through us.
