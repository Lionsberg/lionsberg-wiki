# 11.27 The Meta Movement of the Meta Game

The [[Meta Movement]] of the [[Meta Game]] is is something like the movement:

FROM: Our current state of suffering and injustice

TOWARDS: The [[Meta Goal]]

If we are going to move towards something, why would we consciously choose to move towards anything but the Highest [[Ideal]] we can conceptualize?

Why would we ever choose to consciously sub-optimize?

Why would we move towards anything but the Ultimate Unity of God, through [[Love]]?
