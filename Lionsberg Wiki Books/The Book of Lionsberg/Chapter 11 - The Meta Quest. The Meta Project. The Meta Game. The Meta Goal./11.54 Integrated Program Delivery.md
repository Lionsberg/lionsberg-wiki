# 11.54 Integrated Program Delivery

After a few thousand years of research and development as a species on how to transform the world around us, the leading practice for bringing the most complex and risky projects into reality is [[Integrated Program Delivery]]. 

The core innovation of Integrated Project Delivery is the view of any program of action as a _goal delivery system._

Success on a project involves [[Throughput]] of the [[Goal]] of the [[Project]] into [[Reality]]. The way to accomplish the [[Work]] of bring [[Intention Into Reality]] is through a proven [[System]] and methodology that *causes* that to happen, in a reliable and continuously improving [[Way]] over [[Time]].

We have prepared a separate Integrated Program Delivery Guide that explains in detail how to do this for a [[Meta Project]] that encompasses the set of all potential projects that humanity is undertaking at any given point in time.
