# 11.2 A Light Tale of New

In a bright [[New Era]], when the veils had been torn and [[Light]] flooded the darkness, Christian crusaders and Muslim warriors approached one another on a great battlefield to wage what both sides thought was a holy war.

As they approached, both sides feverishly prayed to the [[ONE]] for favor and victory against the enemy.

In a thousand Christian churches, worried mothers and fathers prayed to the One for the victory and safe return of their beloved children. 

In a thousand Muslim Mosques, worried mothers and fathers prayed to the One for the victory and safe return of their beloved children. 

In a thousand human homes, young children prayed that their beloved brothers and sisters would return.

They warred together against their common enemy; they confronted and overcame the [[Meta Enemy]] of [[Old]]; they cut it up into pieces, and co-created the [[New World]].

They waged war with perfect integrity. They honored every commandment, every basic sense of human decency, and the loving heart of the [[ONE]].

The [[ONE]] looked down in infinite [[Love]] and compassion on the beautiful families that prayed, and the beautiful children who rejoiced.

“The finally know that I am [[ONE]], and that they are one, and the madness and suffering has finally ceased.”
