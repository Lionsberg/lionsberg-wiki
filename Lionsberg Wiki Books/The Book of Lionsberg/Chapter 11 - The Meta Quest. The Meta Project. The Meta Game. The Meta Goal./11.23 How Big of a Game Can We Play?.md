# 11.23 How Big of a Game Can We Play?

If in its early state of development, society was able to organize a whole set of games and the international logistics of olympics and war, surely we now have the capability to construct a game at virtually any scale we might desire. 

We could all choose to play this game simply because it was fun, enjoyable, and led to happiness and abundance.

We could also choose to play the game because if we refused to, our children and grandchildren were at risk of suffering for generations.

If we had to construct a [[New Game]], what kind of game should we construct? 

How big of a game could we play? 

We would want to [[Aim]] for the [[Highest and Best]] game we could possibly conceptualize.

The [[Meta Game]] that encompasses all possible sets of games.
