# 11.75 Each Life Form is an Experiment

Each unique individual manifestation of life is a prototype and a learning experiment.

Whether it is an individual who is transforming their life, or an organization transforming the world, the community must help, observe, cultivate, and learn.

With failure, as with success, the [[Meta System]] learns.

As prototypes grow into maturity, if they are successful they will spread ideas, initiatives, and communities around the world carrying the DNA of the [[New World]] into every community of life, bringing healing, regeneration, vision, hope, and change.

The same DNA, uniquely manifest in each unique culture, being, and environment will bring a stunning array and diversity of life into being.

Rainforests and ecosystems continuously develop and enrich if we apply the Patterns of Life and avoid the Patterns of Death, and so too will the diverse and abundant Culture of the [[New World]].
