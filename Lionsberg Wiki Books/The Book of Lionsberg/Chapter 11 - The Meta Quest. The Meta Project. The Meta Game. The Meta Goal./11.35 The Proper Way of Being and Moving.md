# 11.35 The Proper Way of Being and Moving

So we have a Physical Science, and a Metaphysical Science, encompassed within a [[Meta Science]] that informs us how we ought to BE and conduct ourselves in light of all that IS. The Science of Duty. 

What it is we are to [[Do]] and how we are to [[Be]] in [[Light]] of [[All]] we have come to know.

We have a [[Meta Game]], whose [[Meta Goal]] is the [[Ideal]] of [[God]]. 

We have a notion that [[Success]] in the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game|Meta Game]] is a matter of [[Progress]] not perfection, and that [[Progress]] is marked by the movement of all life from whatever current suffering, corruption, or injustice is plaguing us, towards the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of the [[Living System]] and [[All]] its inhabitants in harmony with One Another and [[God]]. 

[[Success]] is the [[Progressive Realization]] of [[The Goal]]. 

We know that in the [[Meta Game]] we and all things are in motion, [[Spiraling Up]] or [[Spiraling Down]] with every breath, heartbeat, and thought. We know this spiral is dictated by discernible [[Patterns of Life]] and [[Patterns of Death]], which constitute the [[The Pattern Language of Heaven]] and [[The Pattern Language of Hell]]. 

We know approximately [[Where We Are]]... our immediate starting point in the [[Creative Field]].

And although we can only see distant shadows of what is possible… we know approximately where [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]. We have selected our [[Aim]].  

And we know that our [[Destiny]] is superior in every way to the [[Old World]] we are leaving behind.

And we know that this [[Meta Goal]] that we orient ourselves towards must be achieved in a [[Way]] that also properly integrates and achieves the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]]. 

So the next task is to determine the proper Way of being and moving...
