# 11.51 Fractal Application of the System to Each Domain

Our effort to design and build a [[Better World]] is simplified via the [[The Seven Steps of Transformation]]: 

1. Story
2. Vision and Design    
3. Context and Analysis  
4. Engagement  
5. Strategy and Planning  
6. Action  
7. Measurement, Retrospection and Continuous Improvement  

This basic seven step process applies not only to the [[Meta Project]] in aggregate, but also fractally to every domain that must be transformed.

1. Individuals  
2. Families  
3. Teams  
4. Organizations  
5. Communities  
6. Bioregions  
7. Tribes  
8. Nations  
9. Planets  
10. Solar Systems  
11. Etc.  

The transformation of our lives and our world is very local and pragmatic. The same process applies to the domain of your personal health, or your marriage.

Transform yourself, transform your relationships, transform your family, transform your community, transform your world.
