# 11.51 Fractal Application of the System to Each Domain

Our entire effort to design and build a [[Better World]] is contained within a simple [[Six Step Process]]: 

1. Vision and Story  
2. Analysis and Understanding  
3. Engagement  
4. Strategy and Planning  
5. Action  
6. Measurement and Continuous Improvement  

This basic 6 step process applies not only to the [[Meta Project]] in aggregate, but also fractally to every domain that must be transformed.

1. Individuals  
2. Families  
3. Teams  
4. Organizations  
5. Communities  
6. Bioregions  
7. Tribes  
8. Nations  
9. Etc.  

The transformation of our lives and our world is very local and pragmatic. The same process applies to the domain of your personal health, or your marriage.

Transform yourself, transform your relationships, transform your family, transform your community, transform your world.
