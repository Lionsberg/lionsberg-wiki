# 11.77 The Right Leaders

When cultivating people, the obvious leverage point is the cultivation of leaders who have the capacity to productively organize and guide those around them to accomplish meaningful things.

Avoid leaders who are building their own little kingdoms like the plague. Vanquish them and drive them out. 

There is only One Kingdom in the [[New World]].

Return to the ancient traditions and practices. How were leaders discerned? What is the role of the grandmothers?

How does society depose the leaders who begin to depart from the Way, and play the game of empire and oligarchy to the harm of society?

How did we forsake our responsibility and allow leadership in our society to devolve to the tragedy it was as the new millennium began? How do we ensure that we never return to that point of abject corruption and failure?
