# 11.26 The Meta Goal of the Meta Game

If the single permeating design concept of the [[New World]] / [[Meta Game]] is something like [[Love]]…

And if the basic desire of [[Love]] is for the object of one’s love to develop into the fullness of its potential and flourish in harmony…

And if our [[Love]] becomes big enough to permeate and encompass all [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]] without exception…

Then the [[Meta Goal]] of the [[Meta Game]] is something like:

*The total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of all generations of life and consciousness.* 

The Goal of the [[Meta Game]] is something like:

*That which lies beyond Tthe Highest Intention and Greatest Good of which we can presently conceive.*

The Goal of the [[The Way/Concepts and Ideas/Meta Game|Meta Game]] is something like: 

*The [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]].* 

They are One.
