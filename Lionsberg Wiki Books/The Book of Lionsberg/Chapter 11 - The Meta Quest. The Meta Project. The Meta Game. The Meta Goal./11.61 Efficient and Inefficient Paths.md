# 11.61 Efficient and Inefficient Paths

For a journey as simple as walking from one's home to one's [[Place of Practice]], there are efficient paths one can take, and inefficient paths one can take.

It is interesting to observe nature and the way animals move to discover things about the efficiency of paths.

The farther you are traveling, the more critical wise planning becomes. If you are scaling Mount Everest, choosing the efficient path is the difference between life and death.

Inefficient paths [[Waste]] valuable [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]]. 

Efficient paths create the greatest [[Value]] by optimizing the use of [[Time]], [[Energy]], and [[Resources]] to create the greatest progress towards, or [[Throughput]] of, [[The Goal]].

The [[Efficient Path]] is also called the [[Critical Path]], or [[Critical Chain]], with some subtle nuances in meaning.
