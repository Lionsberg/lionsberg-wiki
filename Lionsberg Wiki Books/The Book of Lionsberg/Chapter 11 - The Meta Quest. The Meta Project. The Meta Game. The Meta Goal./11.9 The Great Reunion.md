# 11.9 The Great Reunion

Yes, the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine are each rising and raising one another up. 

Yet what quantum power lies in the unity of the Divine Masculine and the Divine Feminine!

They are inviting us to rediscover our unity.

We are one.

All are one.

God is One.

One is Love.

One Love.

One Life.

One Source.

One.
