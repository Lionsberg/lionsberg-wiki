# 11.60 The Path Towards The Goal

The [[Meta Commitment]] is the eternal and universal constant in the Order of Commitments.

However the eternal constant compels us to movement because it is associated with an [[Intention]] and [[Goal]]. 

[[The Goal]] is decomposed into a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] via a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. 

The Work Breakdown Structure presents a more granular, categorized view of all the [[Work]] that needs to occur to accomplish the [[Meta Goal]]. 

On many projects, we create guidelines that force a very high level of granularity, for instance by requiring that no activity on the [[Network of Commitments]] is longer than 5 days in duration. This forces a very high level of specificity, logic, and analysis, which results in thousands of single interrelated things that must be done in order to [[Progress]] along the path towards [[The Goal]].
