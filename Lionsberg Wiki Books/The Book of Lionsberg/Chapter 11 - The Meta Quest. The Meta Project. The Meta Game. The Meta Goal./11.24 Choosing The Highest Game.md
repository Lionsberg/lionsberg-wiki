# 11.24 Choosing The Highest Game

If billions of people are going to play a game together, we would be foolish to play any game other than the [[Highest and Best]] game of which we could collectively conceive.

Why would we intentionally play a game that moves us towards anything other than the [[Meta Goal]]?

And what other game could possibly move us towards the [[Meta Goal]], but the [[Meta Game|Meta Game]]? 

When you understand the [[Meta Goal]] and its ontological origin in [[God]], by definition there is only [[One]] game available to play, which is the [[Meta Game]] through which we progress and help all life progress towards the [[Meta Goal]].

What if we attempted to conceptualize a [[Meta Game]], which if played by all members of society, would result in the co-creation of a [[New World]] beyond our wildest expectations in-breaking and becoming reality within a single generation?

Is it possible to rationally abstract out such a game, and discern what its rules might be?

Let’s attempt to invent a game…

With logic and rules…

Such that if we chose to play it together as a human species, a [[New World]] would result that would be superior in every way to the [[Old World]] we are leaving behind, within a single generation.
