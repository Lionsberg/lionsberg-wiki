# 11.59 The Order of Commitments

Like loves, authorities, laws, and all things there is an proper logical order of commitments that causes throughput of the Goal within the [[Meta System]].

At the top of the Order of Commitments is the [[One]] persistent, perpetual, eternal, [[Meta Commitment]] to the [[Meta Intention]] and the [[Meta Goal]]. 

All other commitments are secondary temporal hypotheses on the [[Wise Right Thing]] to do to accomplish [[The Goal]].

If a secondary commitment ever violates the [[Meta Commitment]],  the secondary commitment must always be broken to do the [[Wise Right Thing]].
