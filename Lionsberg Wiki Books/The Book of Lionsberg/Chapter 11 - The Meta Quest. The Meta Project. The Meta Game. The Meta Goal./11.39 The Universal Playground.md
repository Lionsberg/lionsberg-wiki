# 11.39 The Universal Playground

As we gain intuition for the [[Meta Game|Meta Game]], we must ask our Selves upon which playground it is to be played. 

The obvious answer, which We will not belabor, is that the [[Meta Game|Meta Game]] is played on the [[Meta Playground]], which is the entire universe and [[All]] it contains, without exception. 

For most people, we could temporarily bring it down to [[Playground Earth]], without forgetting the [[Spiritual War]] unfolding across the Universe and throughout the [[Spiritual Realm]] that we are caught up in. 

Remember that [[The Game]] is about Co-Creation with [[God]], who exists beyond the illusion of [[SpaceTime]]. 

The crucial thing is to not scoff at the Whole, or decide you are just going to [[Suboptimize]] for whatever locality you can wrap your head around. Suboptimation for localities at the expense of the [[Whole]] is a key [[Pattern of Death]].
