# 11.71 Designing and Building That Which Co-Creates the New World

As odd as it might be, we have both the power and the responsibility to consciously co-create and choose the [[Metaphysical DNA]] that will inform the next millennium how to manifest to us and to all generations of life.

Since the [[Information]] contained in the [[Metaphysical DNA]] is what will inform how the [[New World]] manifests, by designing and building [[Metaphysical DNA]] we are designing and building That Which Will Co-Create the New World. 

While in some senses we can say that people are what will design and build the [[New World]], we could actually say that it is that which designs and builds people that is ultimately that which designs and builds the [[New World]] through the co-creative agency of humanity.

While this, like all pathways, ultimately leads back to [[God]], we are invited into its conscious process of [[Co-Creation]] and [[Selection]]. 

So taking our proper place and [[Authority]] as [[Conscious Agents]] of, and co-creators with, the One, and rising towards the mind of the One…

It is time to design and build that which will inform the [[Conscious Agency]] of humanity over the next 1,000 years and beyond.

It is time to design and build That Which Will Design and Build the [[New World]].    

It is time to design and build a higher [[Metaphysical DNA]]. A higher consciousness, more closely united to and informed by the [[Spirit of God]].
