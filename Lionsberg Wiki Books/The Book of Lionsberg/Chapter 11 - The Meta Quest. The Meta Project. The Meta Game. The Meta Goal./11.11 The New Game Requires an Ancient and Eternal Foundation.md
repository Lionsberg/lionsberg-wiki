# 11.11 The New Game Requires an Ancient and Eternal Foundation

The [[New]] must be refounded on the Ancient and Eternal [[ONE]]. 

We could call it [[The Great Refounding]]. 

[[The Great Refounding]] of our lives. 

[[The Great Refounding]] of our society. 

[[The Great Refounding]] of our world. 

Only [[ONE]] foundation can support the [[New World]] throughout the millennia.

The [[New World]] is so true, so dense, so real that in its presence the Old is barely visible. 

The [[New]] is so metaphysically dense that it would instantly crush any part of the [[Old]] you attempted to construct it on.

No man made nation, religion, concept or ideology can contain the [[ONE]] from Whom All Creation arises. 

The [[Old]] flees before the [[New]] like darkness fleas before the light.Â 

The only thing strong enough to eternally uphold [[Life]], [[Light]], and [[Love]] is their eternal Source.

There is only [[ONE]] suitable foundation for the [[New Game]].

The Foundation and the Source are the [[ONE]] from whom All [[Life]], [[Light]], and [[Love]] arise.

[[Love]] is the most powerful force on earth.

We must learn how to wield it properly in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]].
