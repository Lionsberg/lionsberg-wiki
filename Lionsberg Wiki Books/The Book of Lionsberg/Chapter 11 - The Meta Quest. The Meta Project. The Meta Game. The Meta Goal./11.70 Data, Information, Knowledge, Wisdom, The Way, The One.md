# 11.70 Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom, The Way, The One

What actually causes life, society, or a [[New World]] of flourishing and abundant life and society to rise towards its Goal over millennia?

Information.

It is information that informs the [[Energy]] of the universe and instructs it how to manifest.

It is information that brings [[Energy]] into Form. 

Information exists mid-level in a hierarchy that is approximately: 

1. Data  
2. Information  
3. Knowledge  
4. Wisdom  
5. The Way   
6. The One  

Data needs to be elevated and transformed into information. Information needs to be elevated and transformed into knowledge. Knowledge needs to be elevated and transformed into Wisdom. Wisdom needs to be elevated and transformed into a Way of individually and collectively being in the world, that brings us into a higher order functional unity with the One.
