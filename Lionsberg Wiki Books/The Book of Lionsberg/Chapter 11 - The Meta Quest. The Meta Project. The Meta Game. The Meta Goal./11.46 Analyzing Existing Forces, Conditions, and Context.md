# 11.46 Analyzing Existing Forces, Conditions, and Context

Once we understand the [[Creator's Intent]] and [[The Goal]] we are trying to accomplish together, we need to understand the existing forces and conditions currently bearing on [[Worksite Earth]].

All creation and all transformation happens within an existing context and domain. We are not operating in a vacuum, or painting on a blank canvas. We cannot be naïve or ignore the existing forces and conditions or we will fail.

Our Vision and Goal is colliding with a whole set of existing conditions and forces that must be understood, reconciled and resolved in order for our Goal to be realized.
