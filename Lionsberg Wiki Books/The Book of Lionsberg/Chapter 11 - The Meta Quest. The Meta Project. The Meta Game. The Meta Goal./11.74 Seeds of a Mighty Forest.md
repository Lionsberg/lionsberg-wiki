# 11.74 Seeds of a Mighty Forest

These New yet Eternal seeds will sprout into many different manifestations, in many different environments, and take on a wide diversity of forms.

Some will fall in shallow soil and whiter in the hot sun. Others will be choked out by the worries and concerns of the world. Others will will fall into poisoned soil and grow deformed. Â 

Yet others will sink their roots deep into good soil and flourish. They will grow into mighty trees bearing the [[Good Fruit]] of the [[New World]], and providing shelter, nourishment, and life to many.

The most fruitful will spread their seeds far and wide, and soon a mighty, diverse, and inter-existent forest will blanket the earth, re-creating an ecosystem in which all life can develop towards the fullness of its [[Potential]] and flourish in [[Harmony]].
