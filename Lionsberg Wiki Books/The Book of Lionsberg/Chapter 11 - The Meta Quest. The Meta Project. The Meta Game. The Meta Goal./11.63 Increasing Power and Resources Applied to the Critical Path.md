# 11.63 Increasing Power and Resources Applied to the Critical Path

Every moment, we decide how much of our [[Energy]], at what [[Rate]] to apply to various potential paths.

Our mission is to: 
1. Grow the unified pool of [[Energy]] available  
2. Accelerate the [[Rate]] at which [[Energy]] is applied towards the [[Critical Path]] or [[Critical Chain]]  

The [[Critical Path]] / [[Critical Chain]] is determined based on the [[Bottleneck]] to [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].

Our [[Power]] to transform is a function of the amount of [[Energy]] we can gather and the [[Rate]] at which we can apply it to the [[Critical Chain]].
