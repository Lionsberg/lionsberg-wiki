# 7.3 The Nature Of Nature Is One

The inherent nature of [[Nature]] is that it is a unity. 

A single coherent [[System]] arising from and sustained by its [[Source]]. 
 
The [[Living System]] is an infinitely complex, generative, adaptive, coherent [[Whole]]. 
 
In a complex, adaptive, generative, coherent [[Whole]], [[Wisdom]] optimizes for the total Integrated Wellbeing and Development] of the [[Whole]]. 

This is a guiding rule of both [[Nature]] and the [[Meta Game]]… 
  
All things ought to be, in the [[Wise Right]] [[Way]], that allows [[All]] things across all [[Time]] and [[Space]] to rise towards the fullness of their potential. 

The nature of [[Nature]] is one.
