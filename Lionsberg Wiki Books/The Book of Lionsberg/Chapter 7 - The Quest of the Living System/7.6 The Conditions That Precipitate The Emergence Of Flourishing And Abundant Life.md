# 7.6 The Conditions That Precipitate The Emergence Of Flourishing And Abundant Life

This creates the moral imperative for us to partner with [[One]] and [[All]] to [[Co-Create]] the [[Conditions]] most suitable for fostering the  [[Emergence]] of [[That Which Is Trying to Emerge]]. 

It means nurturing and fostering [[Emergence]].
 
It means celebrating and embracing the unique contribution of each emergent form to the [[Whole]]. 

It means curiosity and not knowing. 

It means discovering what unique gift each is bringing forth to enrich the [[Whole]].  

It means grappling with [[Why]] something is emerging when it is. 

Why that? Why now? 

What is it in the [[Logos]] that caused that to arise here [[Now]]? 
 
In the [[Living System]], all things [[Conspire]] to continuously improve and regenerate the environment and co-create the conditions that allow the [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]] that is trying to emerge from the [[Mind]] of the [[One]] to emerge and flourish in harmony.  

As [[Conscious Agents]] who are one with the the [[Living System]], our role is clear. 

We should do what [[One]] would do, we should do what [[Love]] would do, to cultivate flourishing and abundant [[Life]] for [[All]].
