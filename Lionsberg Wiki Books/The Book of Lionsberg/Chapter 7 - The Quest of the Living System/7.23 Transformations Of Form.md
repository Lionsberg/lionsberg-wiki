# 7.23 Transformations Of Form

This associative and dissociative nature of atoms, through their ultimate subatomic nature which is [[Energy]], is what accounts for the physical changes and transformations we witness all around us in the [[Living System]]. 
Â 
The entire universe is Continuously Transforming through the association and dissociation of [[Energy]]. 

Nothing remains the same, even nano-second by nano-second. 

Each component of the universe Transforms according to a unique [[Tempo]]. The unique Tempo of Transformation of each Form Informs its [[Spacetime User Interface]], which determines how each Form of [[Life]] or [[Consciousness]] experience [[Space]] and [[Time]]. 

There is a [[Rhythm]] and a [[Harmony]] to the Transformation.
