# 7.1 The Quest Of The Living System

The quest of the [[Living System]] is not different than the quest of the [[ONE]].
 
It is through the [[Living System]] that the [[ONE]] is [[Realizing]] Itself. 
 
The [[Living System]] is a glimpse into the [[Mind]] of the [[ONE]] it emanates from. 

It is a window into the nature, [[Intention]], and [[Principles]] of the [[ONE]]. 
 
If we understand the [[Living System]], we can understand the [[Way]] the [[Creative One]] creates. 
 
If we understand the [[Way]] the [[Creative One]] creates…
 
We can progressively learn together how [[Co-Create]] in the same [[Way]]. 
 
The [[Quest]] of the [[ONE]], the [[Quest]] of the  [[Living System]], and the Quest of [[All]] are one.
