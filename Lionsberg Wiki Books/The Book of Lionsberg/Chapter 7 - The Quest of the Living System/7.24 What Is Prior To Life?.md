# 7.24 What Is Prior To Life?

We have built our way up towards the starting point of [[Life]] as we [[Perceive]] It. 

Flowing from the [[Consciousness]] of [[ONE]] is a [[Logos]]… 

...that is exciting and instructing a [[Creative Field]]… 

...to bring [[Potential]] into [[Reality]] from the bottom up… 

...by associating and dissociating [[Energy]] into various temporal [[Forms]]… 

...including [[Soil]] and [[Water]] and [[Air]]… 

...that eventually [[Co-Create]] the total set of [[Conditions]]… 

...that must be present for the [[Potential]] of [[Life]] to manifest itself into [[Reality]].
