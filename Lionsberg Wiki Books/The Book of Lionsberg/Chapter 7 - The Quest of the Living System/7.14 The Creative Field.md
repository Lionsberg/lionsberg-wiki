# 7.14 The Creative Field 

On our Quest to build a Human, we advance from [[Creative Consciousness]], [[Potential]], and [[Information]] to (something like) a [[Creative Field]] or [[Field of Co-Creation]]. 

A universal [[Configuration Space]]. 

The [[Field]] is deeper and more fundamental than any observable quanta, particle, or wave. 

It is perhaps best conceptualized as a [[Unity]] or [[Whole]] that can be excited into [[Continuous Transformation|Continuously Transforming]] [[Form]]. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that it is not empty. It is not a vacuum. It is energized. It is far deeper than [[SpaceTime]], and not limited thereby.
