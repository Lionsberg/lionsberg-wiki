# 7.7 Perception From Our Vantage Point

In the Quest to Perceive, we discussed our unique and limited vantage point as humans. 

We discussed our [[Spacetime User Interface]]. 

We discussed the illusion of [[SpaceTime]]. 

We discussed [[Reality]] beyond our [[Perception]]. 

As we begin conceptually exploring the [[Living System]], it is critical that we attempt to liberate ourselves from the illusion of [[SpaceTime]] and our very limited [[Perception]] in order to see beyond into what actually is. 

If we are to [[Co-Create]] how the [[Creator]] creates, then we must learn to [[Perceive]] the [[Way]] the Creator Perceives. 

We must zoom in to see things far smaller than we can see, we must zoom out to see things far larger than we can see, we must exit spacetime to perceive things in times and places that are not here and now, so that we can understand how to be and do how [[ONE]] would be and do [[Here]] and [[Now]]. 

It is this deepest fundamental fabrics that we must work with if we are to [[Co-Create]] the [[New World]]. 

To [[Co-Create]] the conditions that allow the [[New World]] to [[Emerge]], we are going to have to work on the smallest and largest levels that for nearly all our history have been invisible to nearly all of us.
