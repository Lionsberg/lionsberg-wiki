# 7.13 Logos

Out of all that could Be, what actually Is follows a [[Logic]]. 

Per our hypothesis of the [[Deepest Thing]], this [[Logic]] flows from its [[Source]]. 

This perfect Divine Logic is often called [[Logos]].

[[Logos]] is associated with [[Word]] and [[Speech]]. 

Before a Human Being Is and can speak things into Being, the [[Logos]] that speaks the Human into Being Is. 

The [[Logos]] contains within Itself the total set of [[Information]] and [[Logic]] that instructs [[Energy]] how to manifest into [[Form]]. 

It can be thought of as (something like) [[Metaphysical DNA]].  

It is the total instruction manual for the Universe, that contained all the [[Logic]] of the Universe, before those instruction manuals were manifest in physical [[DNA]].
