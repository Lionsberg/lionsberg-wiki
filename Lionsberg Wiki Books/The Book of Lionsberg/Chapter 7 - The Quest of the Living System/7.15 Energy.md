# 7.15 Energy

The nature of the [[Creative Field]] at the highest level of resolution we can [[Perceive]] seems to be (something like) [[Energy]]. 

The vast majority of this [[Energy]] is still [[Dark]] and has not yet been illuminated by Science. 

It is a [[Reality]] that can be worked with before it can be Understood. 

Therefore it is important to not limit ones conception of [[Energy]] to society's present definitions and understanding of it, but to broaden ones conception to include the still [[Dark]] and [[Unknown]] elements of it.
