# 7.22 Chemical Compounds And Molecules

As our Quest continues up the hierarchy of structure we find that in obedience to the same [[Logos]], atoms, like Energy, can Associate and attach to one another. 

This is often described as a chemical bond, and forms a Chemical Compound. 
 
Atoms can also Dissociate from one another. 
 
Two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds are generally classified into [[Molecules]], which are neutral and do not carry an electrical charge, and [[Ions]], which possess a net electrical charge. 
 
Homonuclear molecules only contain the atoms of a single chemical element, such as oxygen (02). 
 
Heteronuclear molecules contain the atoms of more than one chemical element, such  as water (H2O), which contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

We chose Water as an example, because before [[Life]] is, [[Water]] is.
