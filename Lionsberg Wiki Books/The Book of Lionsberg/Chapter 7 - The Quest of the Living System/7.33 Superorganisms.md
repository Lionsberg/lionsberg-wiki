# 7.33 Superorganisms

Some forms of [[Life]] contain both a host and an assemblage of many other species living on or within it, which together form a single coherent ecological unit of life. 

These forms of [[Life]] are called [[Superorganism|Superorganisms]]. 

Human beings are one such [[Superorganism]]. 
 
The human body is composed of trillions of “human” cells, plus an _even greater_ number of inter-existent “non-human” microbes that co-inhabit the coherent human form. 

These hundreds of other non-human [[Intelligent]] species of [[Life]] that live within and upon a human are essential to the proper functioning of a human.

Remember, these non-human microbes somehow possess far more [[Intelligence]] than we [[Realize]]. 

The aggregate Intelligence present in a human [[Superorganism]] is not simply a product of the brain. 

It is the product of the totality of a far Deeper and more permeating system of both ‘human’ and ‘non-human’ Intelligences made possible by the underlying field of Intelligence and the [[Source]] from which it flows.
