# 7.17 Conditions

Every place within the [[Creative Field]]  has a Continuously Transforming set of [[Conditions]]. 

These [[Conditions]] at any given moment in any given place are a product of the union of what already is or has been with [[Conscious Agency]]. 

[[Conditions]] determine which Potentials, out of the total set of All Potentials, can actually manifest.
