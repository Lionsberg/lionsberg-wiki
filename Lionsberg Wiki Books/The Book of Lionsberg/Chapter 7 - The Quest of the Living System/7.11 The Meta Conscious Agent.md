# 7.11 The Meta Conscious Agent

In building up our human, we therefore return to and begin with [[ONE]]. 

To start building up a Creatively Conscious Being, we start with the [[Source]] of [[Creative Consciousness]], Itself no less [[Conscious]] than the [[Consciousness]] emanating from It. 

This is the [[Meta]] [[Conscious Agent]]. 

This is the beginning. 

This is the [[ONE]].
