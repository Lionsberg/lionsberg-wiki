# 7.16 Information

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that [[Energy]] seems to be "instructed" how to coalesce into [[Order]] or [[Form]] by coherent [[Information]]. 

This "arising into Form" can be conceptualized in terms of parts or particles coalescing into Form, or as excitations of a continuously transforming underlying [[Whole]]. 

The total ordered set of all Wisdom, Information, and Knowledge is the [[Logos]].
