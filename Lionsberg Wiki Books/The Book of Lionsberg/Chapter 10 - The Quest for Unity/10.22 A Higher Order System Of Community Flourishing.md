# 10.22 A Higher Order System Of Community Flourishing

Many have discovered that the kinds of communities they would desire to live in do not exactly accord with the kinds of communities they have been born into have ended up in. As many of us look around the places we currently are, we struggle to identify affordable, thriving Communities of Life suitable for our development. 

[[There Is No Them]] coming to create these communities for [[Us]].

It is up to us, the free and empowered [[Co-Creators]] of the [[New World]], to design and build the higher order systems and ways of being in [[Community]], and the physical, social, and virtual [[Communities]] themselves.

The transformation and [[Co-Creation]] of flourishing Communities of Life is absolutely essential to the [[Meta Project]].Â 

These [[Hospitable Environments]] in which human beings are most likely to develop into the fullness of their potential and flourish can be developed relatively simultaneously around on the world on the basis of a [[Pattern Language]] and set of shared [[Protocols]] that ensure the [[Coherence]] and [[Interoperability]] of the [[Community of Communities]] we are [[Co-Creating]].

This total set of patterns and protocols can be abstracted out into a higher order [[System]] of flourishing in community, which is then instantiated into a growing network of interconnected, interoperable, and continuously learning and improving Prototypes.
