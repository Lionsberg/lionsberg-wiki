# 10.24 Individuals And Systems

If we were enlightened and animated by the [[Spirit]] and [[Universal Law]] of [[Love]], we would [[Transform]] whatever systems we were a part of until they manifested the fruit of the [[New World]].

The systems are not the problem. We are.

At the same time, we are not the problem. It is the system and the incentives. 

If the systems were enlightened and animated by the [[Spirit]] and the [[Universal Law]] of [[Love]], they would help transform and empower whatever individuals were a part of them to manifest the fruit of the [[New World]].

Systems and structure inform and transform individuals. 

It is a [[Reciprocal Opening]], a [[Spiral Upward]] towards [[Life]], or a [[Spiral Downward]] towards [[Death]].
