# 10.2 Sovereignty Leads To Action, Action Leads To Community

As we rediscover our [[Sovereignty]] and [[Agency]], and take up our [[Authority]], we begin to move.

The rediscovery of [[Sovereignty]] always leads to action.  

The [[Theory]] always leads to [[Practice]]. 

When we discover that we are suffering, that our loved ones are suffering, and that it doesn’t have to be this way… that we were created for more… and that the only thing standing between us and our rightful destiny is the [[Obstacle]]...  

WE MOVE.

As soon as we move to act in any meaningful way, we discover the limitations of [[Being]] and [[Doing]] alone.

We can’t do it alone. We weren’t created to be alone. In isolation, we all lack the total transformational power that is needed to right the ship and sail towards our [[Destiny]].

As soon as we begin to conceptualize and move towards our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], we discover an inherent set of needs and problems, which can only be met in community.
