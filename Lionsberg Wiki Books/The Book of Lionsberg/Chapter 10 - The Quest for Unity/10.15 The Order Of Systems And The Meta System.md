# 10.15 The Order Of Systems And The Meta System

We discussed the [[Order of Loves]] unified and cohered by the [[Meta Love]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Goals]] unified and cohered by the [[Meta Goal]]. 

We discussed the [[Order of Games]] unified and cohered by the [[Meta Game]].  

We discussed the [[Order of Projects]] unified and cohered by the [[Meta Project]].  

We discussed the [[Order of Laws]] unified and cohered by the [[Meta Law]].  

Now we come to the issue of the shared [[Systems]] and [[Infrastructure]] that are societyâ€™s responsibility to co-create in support of [[Individual And Local]] flourishing.

Just like there are countless goals and drives, that must be integrated and properly ordered in service of the [[Meta Goal]], so too are there countless systems of systems, which must be integrated and properly ordered in service of the [[Meta System]]. 

Higher order systems align all underlying systems into a [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] which is capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in life.

What belongs at the top of the [[Order of Systems]]? 

The only possible answer that does not immediately doom us to failure is:

The [[Meta System]]

What is the [[Meta System]]?

It is what lies beyond and unifies the highest order systems of which we can conceive.

It is a perfect, functional, coherent, properly ordered unity of [[All]] things in [[Right Relationship]] with [[One Another]].

It is the [[Way]] the universe should work.  

It is the [[Logos]] of the universe. 

In its natural state, it already works this [[Way]] in [[Nature]]. 

Yet humankind has departed from the [[Way]] and forged systems that are fundamentally misaligned with the [[Meta System]]. This divides the system against itself, and moves it towards [[Failure]]. 

In order for the [[Meta System]] to come back into proper alignment and harmony, we must forge higher order systems in every domain, which align all sub-systems into functional unities that are capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in that domain.

We must then ensure that all higher order systems, including the [[Human System]] and the [[Living System]], are properly aligned and harmonized at the highest possible level we can conceive of, which is the [[Meta System]].

We must then optimize all things for the success of the [[Meta System]] in aggregate, at the [[Universal and Eternal]]  level, so that each individual, local, spacial, and temporal element of life can develop towards the fullness of its potential and flourish, which is [[The Goal]].

In the same way a human being integrates sub-personalities and drives into a total integrated personality that can function in society, the [[Meta System]] is the total integrated universal personality of all Life and consciousness flowing from its [[Source]]. 

It is the total properly ordered embodiment of the [[Perfect]] [[Will]] and [[Intention]] of the [[One]].
