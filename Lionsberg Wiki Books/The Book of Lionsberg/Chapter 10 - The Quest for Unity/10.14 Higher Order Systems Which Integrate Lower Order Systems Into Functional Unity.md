# 10.14 Higher Order Systems Which Integrate Lower Order Systems Into Functional Unity

Over the last decades and centuries we have already created a tremendous amount of [[Infrastructure]].  

We know to to create and assemble systems, machines, buildings, technologies, knowledge, curriculums, and everything that is needed.

The issue is that these systems and infrastructure are scattered and divided, starved for resources and disempowered, competing with one another for resources and access, and in isolation incapable of meeting the needs the solving the common problems, effectively and in aggregate for all.

The solution is to co-create higher order systems, which integrate all lower order systems into a functional unity that is capable of meeting the needs and solving the problems inherent in all communities of life.

At the conceptual top of this [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Systems]] is the [[Meta System]].
