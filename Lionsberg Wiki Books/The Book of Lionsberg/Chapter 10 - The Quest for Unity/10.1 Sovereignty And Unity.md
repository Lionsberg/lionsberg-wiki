# 10.1 Sovereignty And Unity

We were meant to be [[Sovereign]]. We were meant to be [[Free]]. Rulers of our own Souls. Captains of our own ships. [[Co-Creators]] of our own [[Destiny]] and world.

And yet we were not meant to be alone. 

What good is it to be [[Sovereign]], [[Free]], and suffering alone in the desert?

It does not take human beings long to discover that they have inherent needs, which would be easier to meet in family.

It does not take families long to discover that they have inherent needs, which would be easier to meet in community.

It does not take communities long to discover that they have inherent needs, which would be easier to meet in [[Meta Community]].

 [[Freedom]], [[Agency]], and [[Sovereignty]] naturally lead towards the desire to move away from [[Where We Are]] towards something [[Better]], which requires [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among a [[Community]].
 
Having individuated and differentiated our [[Selves]], we must then begin to reintegrate our [[Selves]]. 

Internally. 

In a family. 

In an organization. 

In a community. 

In a tribe. 

In a nation. 

In the [[Meta Nation]]. 

And each of those levels of analysis and order must be stacked up and aligned, so that the [[Whole]] can flourish.
