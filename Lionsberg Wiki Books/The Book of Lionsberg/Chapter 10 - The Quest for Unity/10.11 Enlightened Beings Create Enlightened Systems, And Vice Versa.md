# 10.11 Enlightened Beings Create Enlightened Systems, And Vice Versa

A seemingly obvious but hidden insight is that un-enlightened or un-healthy people cannot build enlightened and thriving organizations, communities, and worlds.

In contrast, enlightened, healthy, and flourishing systems of coherence flow naturally from the Spirit of light, health, and flourishing life. 

In turn, these enlightened, healthy, and flourishing systems of coherence help create ever more enlightened beings. 

Looking into the rear view mirror, we see that we have been devoting most of our time, energy, technology, and resources to building extractive physical and military organizations and infrastructure in service of national, economic and religious ends.

Looking into the future, we can see the larger [[Meta Project]] of devoting our time, energy, technology, and resources to co-creating a better world in which [[All]] life can flourish.

Enlightened beings put their energy and creative consciousness in service of enlightened and coherent systems, and not in service of unenlightened systems and institutions that employ means that are antithetical to [[The Goal]].
