# 10.7 Unrealized Potential Due To Lack Of Access To Inherent Problems And Needs

These basic unmet [[Problems and Needs]] are therefore also the major thing that holds individuals, organizations, and communities back from progressing towards their [[Potential]], and helping others do the same.

The needs, the pain, and the obstacles standing in our path are actually the [[Way]] towards our potential.

When we voluntarily and progressively confront and overcome that which objects to our movement away from suffering and death, and towards our destiny, we move towards [[The Goal]].  

When we solve our own problems in a way that also helps others solve them, we begin to accelerate the movement of [[All]] towards the [[Goal]].
