# 10.31 Tribal And Community Sovereignty

From time to time, sovereign individuals and families, in order to satisfy our overwhelming desire for the benefits and support of community, voluntarily associate into a higher order forms of organization we often call tribes or communities. 

Communities can operate in either physical or metaphysical domains, such as a community of place, or a community of practice, or a community anchored around any other mutually shared [[Center of Gravity]]. 

In a community, all community members maintain their sovereignty. No member of any community has the right to exploit, harm, oppress, or otherwise violate the sovereignty of any other community member. If any member of a community becomes a corrupt and abusive tyrant, the other sovereigns in that community have the right, and perhaps the moral obligation, to liberate themselves from that tyranny. It is better to be alone in the chaos, than in a false order ruled by a corrupt tyrant. 

The community, as a voluntarily associated unit of society, is also sovereign.

Itâ€™s sovereignty is not granted or derived from any state, but rather inherently and inextricably present, flowing from the sovereignty of voluntarily associated individuals, whose inalienable sovereignty and divine rights and responsibilities flow directly from the [[ONE]].
