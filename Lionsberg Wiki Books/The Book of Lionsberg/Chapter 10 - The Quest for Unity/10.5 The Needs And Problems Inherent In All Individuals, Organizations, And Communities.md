# 10.5 The Needs And Problems Inherent In All Individuals, Organizations, And Communities

Every individual, organization, and community that is trying to progress on the [[Quest]] towards their [[Potential]] has a basic set of inherent [[Problems and Needs]].  

While some of these problems are specific and unique, and therefore need to be handled one at a time through specialized assistance, the vast majority can be abstracted out into [[General Problems]] and [[General Needs]] that are common to all. 

Once the problems have been categorized and generalized, [[General Solutions]] and infrastructure can be forged and continually improved to solve that species of problem for [[All]]. 

Imagine, if everyone on earth had access to the very best solutions that anyone on earth had developed to the basic problems and needs that plague each of us on our [[Quest]] towards our [[Destiny]].
