# 10.13 The Infrastructure Of Arising And Becoming

If we understand that all individual and local elements must of their own [[Free Will]] arise and transform themselves towards their unique [[Potential]]…

...and if we understand that in order to do so, they must each individually and locally confront and overcome the needs, problems, and challenges they are facing…

...and if we understand that in isolation, we _all_ lack the resources, systems, access, and transformational power required to confront and overcome the obstacles facing us, and realize the fullness of our [[Potential]]…

...and if we understand that the [[Obstacles]] facing us are largely common to us [[All]]…

...then naturally it becomes the [[Wise Right Thing]] to do as a [[Society]] to co-create the basic [[Infrastructure]] that helps and empowers all things to arise, discover, and become the fullness of their [[Potential]]...

...in a [[Way]] that helps [[All]] do the same...

...such that [[All]] things are helping [[All]] things rise towards the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] and [[Flourish]] in a [[Goal Diverse]] [[Harmony]].
