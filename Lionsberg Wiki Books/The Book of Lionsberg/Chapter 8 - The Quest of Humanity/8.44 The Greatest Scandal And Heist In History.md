# 8.44 The Greatest Scandal And Heist In History

So what shall we do with the terribly misunderstood, co-opted, and confused point in the [[Story]] where the narrative and [[Logos]] of [[Heaven]] descends and touches [[Earth]]?

The story of Jesus is a truly amazing one, and even more amazing when one breaks free of the fear of eternal conscious suffering in order to understand that the story of Jesus has very little to do with the story of the attempted universal religion set up by the attempted universal empire of Rome.

This surely is the greatest heist and scandal in history.
