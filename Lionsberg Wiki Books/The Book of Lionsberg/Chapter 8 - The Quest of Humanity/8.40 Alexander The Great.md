# 8.40 Alexander The Great

Alexander the Great was tutored by Aristotle until he was 16, ascended to the throne at 20 after the assassination of his father King Phillip the II, and by 30 (around 325 BC) created one of the largest empires in history. His influence, conquest, and colonialism in Asia and Africa dramatically altered history by dominating ancient civilizations and traditions and overlaying them with Greek culture and thought. This synthesis of indigenous and Greek culture resulted in the rise of Koine Greek as the lingua franca throughout the vast empire. Greek thought and culture prevailed, developing further through the rise of the Roman Empire and proliferating throughout the world into what we now consider Western culture.
