# 8.32 Mahavira

Mahavira lived and taught in the 6th century BC in India. 

It is said that after being raised in a royal family, he abandoned all possessions and lived an ascetic lifestyle of severe austerity and intense mediation for 12.5 years.  After obtaining [[Enlightenment]], he traveled and taught for 30 years, focusing on an inner circle of 11 [[Disciples]] who verbally transmitted his teachings after his death. 

Followers were initiated with five vows: Ahimsa ([[Non-Violence]]), satya ([[Truth]]), Asteya ([[Non-Stealing]]); Brahmacharya ([[Chastity]]), and Aparigraha ([[Non-Possession]]). 

The 5 [[Sins]] of injury, falsehood, stealing, unchastity, and attachment were to be avoided on the various dimensions of body, speech, and thought. 

A contemporary of Buddha, Mahavira taught a more elaborated belief in the [[Soul]], which could be continually cleansed, developed, and enlightened through [[Self Discipline]] and [[Self Cultivation]] in order to obtain [[Liberation]]. 

He taught that ahimsa was the supreme moral virtue and applied to all living beings. 

Mahavira also acknowledged the complexity and many-sidedness of [[Truth]] and [[Reality]], and taught that while [[Truth]] and [[Reality]] could be approached and experienced, they could not be fully expressed through language. Thus, all human efforts at communication are only partial expressions of the ultimate underlying [[Truth]] and [[Reality]]. 

Mahavira’s teachings stressed the pragmatic necessity of religious [[Practice]] to the [[Enlightenment]] of the [[Soul]] and [[Right Relationship]] among living beings, in contrast to religion as external ceremony or social custom.
