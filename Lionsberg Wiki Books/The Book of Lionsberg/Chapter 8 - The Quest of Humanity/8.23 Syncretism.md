# 8.23 Syncretism

Syncretism integrated the teachings and best elements from various schools, while endeavoring to dispense with their perceived flaws. This pointed to an inherent underlying [[Unity]] and [[Flow]] from which the various traditions were being expressed. 

In the first millennium BC in China, Syncretism drew ideas from Taoism, Confucianism, Mohism, and Legalism. The earliest textual example of this school, Shizi, is from about 330 BC.

While this is listed as a named phenomena of the Chinese schools of thought in this era, it should rather be regarded as a fundamental basic reality of the development of all human ideas and religions. 

The deep underlying connections and flows between traditions is essential to understand, in order to remain liberated from the dogma of any one institutionalized tradition claiming to be the final authority and sole holder of [[Truth]].
