# 8.37 Legalism

Returning to the Chinese schools of thought, the stream of consciousness which flows towards power and control rose anew during the Warring States period in China between approximately 450 and 220 BC. Their belief was that humanity was inherently selfish, covetous, and incapable of moral behavior in an environment that was free, and that the antidote was to establish a strict system in which individuals pursued their own selfish interest only in ways that benefited the state, resulting in a “rich state and a powerful army”.

The school of thought was unconcerned with individual morality or integrity, and rather advocated for strict enforcement of clearly defined rules / standards / laws / administrative methods dictated by the rulers.

Like later notions of realpolitik or Machiavellianism, objective morality and [[Virtue]] were set aside, and any [[Means]] were acceptable to achieve the [[End]] of consolidating and amplifying the wealth and power of the state, and consolidating the state’s power into strict administrative bureaucracy dominated by an autocratic ruler. 

This arose from the view that people are naturally and irredeemably evil, and that therefore the role of the ruler is to use force to subdue and prevent the evil inherent in humanity from expressing itself.
