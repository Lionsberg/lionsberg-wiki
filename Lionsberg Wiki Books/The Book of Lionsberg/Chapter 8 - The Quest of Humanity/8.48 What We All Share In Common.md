# 8.48 What We All Share In Common

When I speak to people of different traditions, we seem to nearly universally understand and agree that there is [[One]] ultimate [[Uncaused Cause]] from which [[All]] things manifest, through which [[All]] things are sustained, and to which [[All]] things return. 

We seem to nearly universally understand and agree that the [[Spirit]] or [[Essence]] of [[One]] is (something like) [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]].  

We seem to nearly universally understand and agree what constitutes the basic [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]] / [[Sin]], and what constitutes the basic [[Patterns of Life]] / [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Righteousness]]. 

Even when I hear brilliant secular philosophers speak, there is an acknowledgement that although we can't understand its [[Nature]], any Coherent Philosophical System must acknowledge outside of its at least one brute fact or principle. 

And we seem to all intuitively understand that knowing what would bring us joy, and what would bring us suffering, we ought to act in the world in such a way that we do unto others what we would want done unto us, and that we refrain from doing unto others what we would not want done unto us. 

This [[Agreement]] on what we share in common as we [[All]] [[Wrestle With God]] is a powerful and adequate basis for Loving [[Co-Operation]] and [[Right Relationship]].
