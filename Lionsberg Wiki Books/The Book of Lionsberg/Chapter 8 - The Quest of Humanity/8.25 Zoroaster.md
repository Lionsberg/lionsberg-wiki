# 8.25 Zoroaster

Zoroaster, or Zarathustra, was a Persian teacher who lived sometime between the 2nd and 7th centuries BC. Zoroaster effectively challenged the existing religious traditions, sparking a movement that grew into the dominant religion of ancient Persia. Central to his teachings were the struggle within the human being of asha, arta or aša, and druj. [[Asa]], like [[Tao]], is not translatable into a word, but points to the [[True]], objective, [[Reality]] that encompasses and embraces [[All]]. It speaks to [[Truth]], it speaks to existence, it speaks to that which is [[Right]], it speaks to [[Proper Order]]. 

These concepts were associated with one [[Creator]] of [[All]]. Zoroaster taught that the [[ONE]] truthful, right, good [[Creator]] who properly ordered the universe was mythically opposed by a dragon that emerges from the deep to destroy the living world / creation of [[Aša]] / [[Creator]]. The dragon is associated with druj, which is the antithesis of Aša. 

Druj connotes [[Deceit]], falsehood, and that which is not in harmony with the proper created order which is good. 

This battle played out not only in the cosmos, but within individual human beings, whose purpose, along with [[All]] [[Creation]], is to align and sustain itself in [[Aša]], which is the perfect Divine nature of the [[ONE]]. 

He emphasized individual [[Freedom]] and [[Responsibility]], and taught that through [[Right Thought]], [[Right Speech]], and [[Right Action]], we can become co-workers with the [[ONE]], thereby perfecting the world.
