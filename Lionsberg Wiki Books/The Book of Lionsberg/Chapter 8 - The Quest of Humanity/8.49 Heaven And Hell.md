# 8.49 Heaven And Hell

It contrast to the great unity among [[One]] and [[All]] around the [[Spirit]] of [[Truth]] and [[Love]] that ought to guide our [[Way of Being]] as we advance towards our [[Universal Goals and Values]], stands the issue where dialogue seems to fall apart with people possessed by a fundamental religion or ideology. 

Sadly, it is the issue of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. 

We have lost friendships with fundamental friends who were nearly in tears demanding that we agree that if someone was not a member of their belief system, they would be damned to [[Eternal Conscious Torment]]. 

[[We Do Not Know]] and refuse to stand in Judgment, for as every [[Wise]] tradition says only [[One]] is capable of judging the hearts and minds of humanity. 

Yet people who think they [[Know]] and are willing to stand in Judgment over the eternal destiny of another Soul will break relationship. 

We will revisit [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] later, however for now, may humanity be liberated from the abusive narratives threatening humanity with [[Eternal Conscious Torment]] if they do not submit their [[Spiritual And Intellectual Will]] to a set of idolatrous human propositions. 

[[One]] does not reside in a set of propositions made by human hands, any more than [[One]] resides in a temple made by human hands. 

You are Free. You are Loved.
