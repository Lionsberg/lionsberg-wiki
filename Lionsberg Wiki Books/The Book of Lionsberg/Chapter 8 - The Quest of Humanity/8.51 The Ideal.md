# 8.51 The Ideal

There is a striking consensus among the religions of the world and billions of their constituents that the person of [[Jesus]] was a, if not the, [[Penultimate]] / [[Ideal]] expression of what is means to [[Embody]] the [[Spirit]], [[Will]], and [[Intention]] of the [[One]]. 

The profound implication being that if we are going to imitate something other than the [[Absolute]] / Abstract [[Ideal]] of the [[One]], we ought to imitate the closest physical / temporal expression of the [[Spirit]] or [[Essence]] of that [[Ideal]] into embodied form. 

If we cannot adequately conceptualize and relate to the [[Absolute]] [[One]] as such, we ought to imitate the most [[Archetypical]] [[Embodiment]] of the [[One]].

Would it not be true, that if billions of people heeded the words of Jesus, Muhammad, Moses, Aristotle, Lao Tsu and strove to embody the [[Spirit]] that would sacrifice their own life for the sake of [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], and [[Right Relationship]] with [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]], an entirely [[New Era]] would be at hand? 

This is the only [[Prophetic Voice]]. There is only ever [[One]] thing the Prophetic points at. 

Outside of the dogma about the unanswerable mysteries, and outside the asinine notions of [[Eternal Conscious Torment]] for refusing to submit oneself to a particular man-made religious dogma, there is every opportunity in the world for us to [[All]], [[Individually And Collectively]], to choose to [[Doing Our Best|Do Our Best]] to embody the [[Ideal]] of [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]], and thus be Reconciled, Redeemed, and At-Oned to [[One]] and [[All]]. 

This is so simple, liberating, and free. It is the [[True]] [[Good News]].
