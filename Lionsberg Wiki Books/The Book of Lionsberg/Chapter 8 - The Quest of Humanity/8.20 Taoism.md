# 8.20 Taoism

Taoism is a philosophy based on the teachings of Lao-Tsu and the ancient teachings of the I Ching. 

Taoism is a spiritual and philosophical tradition which emphasizes living in harmony with the [[Tao]], or [[Source]] / [[Pattern]] / [[Substance]] / [[Way]] of [[All]]. This includes harmonizing human behavior with [[Nature]] and its [[Source]], and the “three treasures” of [[Compassion]], [[Humility]], and [[Frugality]]. 

Other key concepts include naturalness, simplicity, flow, effortless action (we wei), detachment, and ensuring one does not exert their will or intention against the will or intention of the [[One]].

Harmony with the Tao.
