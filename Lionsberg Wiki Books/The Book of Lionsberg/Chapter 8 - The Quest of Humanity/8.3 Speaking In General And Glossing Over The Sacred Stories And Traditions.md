# 8.3 Speaking In General And Glossing Over The Sacred Stories And Traditions

Speaking in general about the trends of human history and how we got here obviously glosses over the incredible complex local nuances, customs, wisdom, and the traditions of thousands of sacred tribes and peoples.

Over the coming years, we intend to create a platform to gather and amplify the local stories and wisdom of tribes and peoples around the world, whose stories and wisdom  have been trampled over, concealed, and dismissed by the vagaries of history.

For now, we must come together in order to succeed and not fail at this critical juncture in history. In order to come together, we must know [[Who We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]].  In order to know who we are, how we got here, and where we are going, we must create a comprehensible [[Narrative Framework]] that is approximately true, which encompasses and unites us [[All]] in service of life and the better future we all desire.

Please forgive us for glossing over the sacred nuance in order to transmit the broader understanding. We will come back to resurrect the sacred inheritance soon.
