# 8.x4 Who Can Pass Through The Gate?

The possibility of passing through the narrow [[Threshold]] in the [[Boundary of Knowing]] only occurs when one is Brave and Courageous enough to leave behind everything they thought they knew in order to discover [[Reality]] as it actually is. 
 
To pass through the gate into the infinite [[Beyond]], one must admit they [[Do Not Know]] and be willing to take the risk of suffering and death that go with venturing out into the [[Unknown]] in order to discover and bring back that which is of immeasurable worth, and necessary for our individual and collective salvation. 

Only those willing to lose their life out of the sheer boundless desire for [[Truth]], Liberty, and Justice shall pass.
 
If you are ready, let us embark on an infinite [[Quest]] together. 

Let us pass through the [[Boundary of Knowing]] which previously sheltered us from having to confront [[Reality]] as it actually is and could be, and let us navigate towards [[Truth]], towards [[Understanding]], and towards [[Wisdom]] that will lead us inevitably onward towards [[The Goal]] that lies at the beginning and end of the [[Golden Thread]].
 
If we could every more fully Discern, Know, and Rightly Relate to [[Truth]], [[Wisdom]], and their [[Source]], we would [[Understand]] what to do and how to Be in order to Become our Destiny. 

The [[Truth]] would liberate us and [[All]] things.
