# 8.7 The Sixth Stanza

After the fifth epoch, the River of Life had flooded the earth, and it was [[Good]].

In the sixth stanza of the [[Creation]] song, the highest forms of life come into being, capped off by the emergence of a unique being unlike any other, and yet one with them.

Human Beings. 

Conscious cultivators, guardians, and stewards of the earth. Endowed with [[Creative Consciousness]], and equipped with the [[Power]] to consciously create and destroy.

Through the rational progression of epochs and [[Divine]] [[Logic]], the [[Universe]] was brought forth in [[Order]], emanating from and sustained by [[One]].

It was all [[Sacred]], and it was all very [[Good]]. The forces of [[Creation]] and the Universal Laws were established, written throughout all Creation, written on our hearts, embedded in our [[Consciousness]], and set in irreversible and ongoing creative motion.

Guiding all things towards their [[Destiny]]. Guiding all things towards [[The Goal]].
