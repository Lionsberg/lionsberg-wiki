# 8.22 Mo Tzu

Mo Tzu (470 – 391 BC) taught that everyone is equal before [[Heaven]], and that people should imitate [[Heaven]] by Embodying All Inclusive / Universal Love. 

This universality and universal [[Love]] was the central element of his teaching, along with the principles of [[Justice]], [[Pacifism]], [[Frugality]], Unity of Thought And Action. 

He taught that leaders should obey the [[Will Of Heaven]] / [[Jodo]], and that citizens should obey their leaders. 

Officials should be appointed for the Public Good based on [[Virtue]] and [[Ability]], and not [[Nepotism]]. 

Mo Tzu’s teaching based on [[Love]] comes from the Chinese word [[Ai]], and included a stricter emphasis on adhering to the [[Will Of Heaven]], with [[Justice]] being served by [[Karma]] / [[Consequences]].  

This can be differentiated to a degree from the understandings of universal [[Love]] that lean towards forgiveness of sins and [[Mercy]]. Heaven is aware of every [[Sin]] or [[Crime]], and loves [[Justice]] and hates [[Injustice]]. 

[[Injustice]] leads to death, poverty, and [[Chaos]], whereas [[Justice]] leads to life, wealth, and [[Order]]. 

Though a martial artist, he taught that it was perverse for leaders to delight in warfare, and advocated for spending less on the military, and more on good [[Governance]], following the universal laws of [[Justice]], feeding the hungry, and ministering to the ill and vulnerable so that people could [[Flourish]].
