# 8.33 Judaism

Meanwhile in the Levant, in the 9th century BC the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerge, with their growing understanding and worship of Yahweh, which translates as something like The One Who Makes That Which Has Been Made. 

Following the Babylonian captivity of the 6th century BC, between 5th century BC and 70 CE the Israelite religion developed in various schools of thought, and the Hebrew Scriptures including the Torah were canonized. These scriptures reflected growing understanding of teachings of [[One]] [[Creator]] whose characteristics surpassed the characteristics of the pantheon of gods worshiped in the Levant. 

The Torah lays out what are traditionally regarded as 613 commandments that the Hebrews were to observe. These covered both [[Positive Commandments]] (to act or perform), and [[Negative Commandments]] (to abstain). Many teachers argue that in reality there are far more, or even an infinite number of commandments, which result from the proper application of the underlying [[Principles]] to an infinite number of situations in [[Reality]]. 

Ideas developed include:  
- the [[Knowledge]], [[Love]], and [[Worship]] of [[One]] [[Perfect]] [[God]], 
- emulation or imitation of God’s ways, 
- love and do not hate one another, 
- do not oppress or exploit the weak,
