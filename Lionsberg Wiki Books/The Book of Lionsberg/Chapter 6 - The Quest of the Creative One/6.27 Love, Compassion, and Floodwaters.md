The [[ONE]] looked on and sighed at the abuse and misunderstanding, and yet rejoiced in each and every child who was emerging into greater and greater [[Light]].
 
It would not be long until the consciousness of enough children of [[Light]] had risen far enough that the shackles would be thrown off, and [[Truth]], [[Love]], and [[Justice]] would reign.  

Just a little longer. 
 
When the fog of manipulation and deception clears, and we see the simple [[Truth]] and the simple [[Love]], then the knowledge of the [[Quest]] of the [[ONE]] will cover the earth like floodwaters, washing away the self-inflicted evils we are suffering from.
 
When the floodwaters of enlightenment have encompassed the earth and purged all that is unsuitable for the [[New World]], we will be together in paradise.
