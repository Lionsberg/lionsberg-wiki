# 6.25 Hemlock And The Gods Of The State

This time around, will we will still be stoned, imprisoned, or burnt at the stake for speaking [[Truth]]? 

Will we still be crucified for challenging the religious, economic, and political elite? 

The rulers and authorities always kill the prophets. 

And yet the prophets always speak, and are always willing to die, for the [[Truth]]. 

Socrates refused to bow to the imaginary gods recognized by the state in Athens, and was accused of corrupting the youth with his [[Wisdom]]. Rather than betray the [[Truth]], he willingly went to the death, drinking the cup of hemlock and thereby liberating his immortal soul from his mortal body. #story

Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego refused to bow to the image set up by Babylon. They were thrown into the fiery furnace, yet they tread upon the flames. #story 

Each society sets up its Idols, and demands that we worship them.

Refuse at all costs, even to the death. It is far better to lay down our mortal bodies, than to betray the [[ONE]].  

When authorities conflate their forms with the [[Absolute]], death must follow to liberate [[Life]].
