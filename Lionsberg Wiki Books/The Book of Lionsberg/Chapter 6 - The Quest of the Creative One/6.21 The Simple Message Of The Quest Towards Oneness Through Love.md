# 6.21 The Simple Message Of The Quest Towards Oneness Through Love

The Quest of the One Who Is Love is simple. 

It is the Quest towards Oneness through Love. 

We have forgotten how ancient and simple the [[Way]] is. The perfect feels simple yet endlessly Deep and profound when you experience It. 
 
In the midst of the roiling chaos of humanity, a [[Light]].
 
A simple, brilliant, illuminating, inextinguishable [[Light]] in the [[Darkness]]. 
 
Something Fundamental and Constant bursting forth in every corner of the world across all [[Time]] and all [[Space]].
 
From the ancient Hindu, Greek, and Roman sages, to Lao Tzu and Confucius, to Zoroaster, to Jesus, Mohammad, Gandhi and Buddha, we see a basic illumination inherent in human nature, written on our hearts, and proclaimed throughout [[Nature]].
 
Loving [[Right Relationship]] with [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]] is the only [[Answer]]. It is the only [[Way]]. [[Love]] that once fully embodied Unites the fullness of our being with the [[Meta Intention]] for [[All]] [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]] to develop into the fullness of its [[Potential]] and flourish. 
 
[[Love]] is the only logic that satisfies the [[Divine Equation]]. [[Love]] is the only method of liberating ourselves and our planet from [[Injustice]], [[Poverty]], and [[Oppression]]. [[Love]] is the only key that unlocks the door to a [[New Era]] of [[Liberty]] and [[Abundance]].
 
[[Love]] is the [[Way]] we progress on the [[Quest]] towards the heavenly abode that is the dwelling place of fully enlightening consciousness. 
 
Reuniting our True Selves with our [[Source]], and thereby becoming conduits of the [[Spirit]] and [[Intention]] that is perfect, unfailing, unconditional, and all-encompassing [[Love]]. 

The simple message of the [[Quest]] towards [[Oneness]] through [[Love]].
