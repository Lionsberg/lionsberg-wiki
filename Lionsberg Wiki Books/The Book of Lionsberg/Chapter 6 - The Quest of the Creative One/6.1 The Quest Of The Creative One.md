# 6.1 The Quest Of The Creative One

The [[Creative One]] freely gives us infinite [[Abundance]], [[Wisdom]], [[Truth]], and [[Life]]. 
 
The [[Anti-One]] charges us for false scarcity, lies, and ruin.
 
How deeply are we willing to reimagine? 
 
Return to the [[Beginning]]. 

Eternally prior to the first human breath. 
 
Return to the [[Uncaused Cause]].

Return to the [[ONE]]. 
 
The [[Source]] of [[All]]. 

The [[Source]] of [[Energy]], [[Life]], and [[Consciousness]].   
 
Restart with the basic inputs of [[Energy]], Information, and [[Love]]. 
 
Before we can rediscover, reimagine, and rebuild a [[New World]] that is perfectly consistent with the [[Intention]] of the [[ONE]], we must return to a time before the rubble obscured the [[Ancient Foundation]].
