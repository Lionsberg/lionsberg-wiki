# 6.2 Returning To The Uncaused Cause

As we search deeply for the precious gems of [[Wisdom]] gleaming under the surface of our traditions, as we chase the [[Golden Thread]] of [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]] through the millennia, we see a stunningly beautiful tapestry emerge. 
 
Nearly universally, it begins with an origin [[Story]].
 
Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Where are we going? 

Why? 
 
What gives us the [[Consciousness]] to ponder such questions? 

What does it mean that we can even conceive of such questions? 
 
Return to the moment before… the moment that all the stories and all the science points back to and cannot penetrate; the moment where the universe as we know it burst forth and began to [[Become]] what it is [[Becoming]]…
 
The moment the [[Uncaused Cause]] Spoke. Acted. Initiated. Catalyzed. 

And the Universe went bang.
