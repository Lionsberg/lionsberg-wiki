# 6.28 The Invitation And Upward Call

Perhaps the most amazing and overlooked part of this epic story is that the [[Creative One]] invites and calls us up into a Divine partnership of [[Co-Creation]]. 
 
What more Meaningful endeavor could we possibly engage in than Divine Partnership with [[One]] and [[All]]? 
 
The [[Spirit]] of the [[One]] has gifted us with [[Creative Consciousness]] through which we are invited to consciously partake in the [[Co-Creation]] of our universe.

How long will we continue to ignore and reject the invitation? 
 
For far too long we have chased after our own good, not recognizing that when we try to save our own life at the expense of the [[One]] and the [[Whole]], the logical end is death. 

The water we thought would refresh and protect us turns to poison in our veins.
 
Yet the invitation and upward call eternally flows forth from the [[One]]. 

Perhaps it is finally time for us to humbly and gratefully reach out and accept the hand the [[One]] offers, and embark on the greatest adventure we could ever hope for.  
The [[One]] is inviting us to make Its Quest Our Quest. 

The [[Creator]] is inviting us to become [[Co-Creators]] of the [[New World]]. 
 
It is time to advance towards [[Oneness]] with the [[One]].
