# 6.17 Beyond The Masculine Anthropomorphic God

When we lay down our childish conceptions and understand that the big man in the sky we have imagined is not literally “up there”, nor is the terrifying feminine creature with 12 arms we have fearfully sacrificed to actually a reality, nor will the rains or the harvest cease if we fail to sacrifice to the energetic focal points we have erected to represent That Which Brings Rain and Harvest…

When we deeply and humbly and rightly redirect [[All]] our energy and attention to the [[One]]…

We can begin to learn from [[One Another]]. 

How should [[Consciousness]] [[Rightly Relate]] to its [[Source]]? 

How should [[Life]] [[Rightly Relate]] to its [[Source]]? 

How should a [[Creature]] [[Rightly Relate]] to That Which Is Creating and Sustaining it? 

What are we to do, and how are we to relate, in light of all we have come to [[Know]] about the [[One]] in Whom [[All]] things live, breathe, exist, move, and have their [[Being]]? 
 
Here, outside the [[Caves]], beyond the [[Boundary]], is the [[Way]] towards flourishing and abundant [[Life]]. 

What treasures and joys await us as we rediscover the fullness of the Beauty and Majesty of [[One]] and [[All]].  

What treasures and joys await us as we rediscover the Beauty of the Feminine aspects of the [[One]] Who creates and sustains Life!
