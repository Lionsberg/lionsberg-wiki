# 6.5 The Ground of Being

The [[Creative One]] is the Ground upon which all Beings stand, and upon which all Being stands.
 
The [[Ancient Foundation]]. 
 
The [[Divine]] [[Mystery]] so sacred that it cannot be named. 
 
The [[ONE]] thing that remains when the rubble is cleared away, and we can finally see. 
 
The [[ONE]] thing that remains when we look past the beginning. 
 
The [[ONE]] thing that remains when we look past the end. 
 
The [[ONE]] thing that remains when we look deeply enough into [[Now]].
  
The [[Ultimate Reality]] upon and through which [[Life]], [[Consciousness]] and [[Reality]] arise and are sustained.
