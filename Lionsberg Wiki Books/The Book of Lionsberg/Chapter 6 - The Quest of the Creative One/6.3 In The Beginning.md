# 6.3 In The Beginning

In the beginning... 

_...there was nothing but One. All things had not come into being, and no thing existed except that which was possible in the Mind of the One._ 

In the beginning...

_…[[God]] created the heavens and the earth..._
 
In the beginning…

_…the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder._
 
In the beginning…

_…the earth was a formless and desolate void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the [[Spirit]] of [[God]] was hovering over the waters…_
 
In the beginning... 

_…the world at first was endless space in which existed only the [[Creator]]... The world had no time, no shape, and no life, except in the [[Mind]] of the [[Creator]]…_
 
In the beginning… 

_…something formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; silent and amorphous, it stood alone and unchanging, ever present and in motion. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I call it [[Tao]]. For lack of a better word I call it [[Supreme]]…_
 
In the beginning… 

_…the Elohim made the sky and the earth..._
 
In the beginning… 

*…was a tremendous explosion…*
 
In the beginning… 

*…was the [[Logos]], and the [[Logos]] was with [[God]], and the [[Logos]] was [[God]]…* 
 
In the beginning…

…The Spirit That Hovers Over the Waters of Chaos and Speaks the Logos that Co-Creates That Which is Good brings forth the universe. 
 
Yet before that…
  
In the beginning… 
 
Before the beginning…
 
Silent and amorphous; alone and unchanging; together as We; together as [[One]]. 

Transcendent of every Story, Philosophy, and Logic is One Absolute, Primordial, Ultimate, First, Fact. 

The myriad of [[All]] that is and could ever be [[All]] points back to a [[Unity]], an impenetrable [[Source]] of the creative energy that creates, upholds, and sustains the universe.
 
Before and beyond every [[Name]]; before and beyond every attempt to grasp and comprehend; before and beyond every attempt to institutionalize; before and beyond every temple and representation…
 
…from the [[One]], [[All]] things Are. 

It is all the same Story. It is all the same Logic. It is all the same One.
