The Foundation, yes. 
 
Yet also the pinnacle. 
 
The A, yes.  
 
Yet also the Z. 
 
The depths, yes. 
 
Yet also the heights. 
 
The beginning, yes. 
 
Yet also the end. 

The manifest, yes. 

Yet also the transcendent. 
 
The [[Source]], yes. 
 
Yet also the [[Ideal]]. 
 
That which is Most Worthy of awe. 

That which is Most Worthy of imitation. 

That which is Most Worth embodying. 
 
The penultimate. 

The pinnacle. 
 
That which stands alone at the top of the [[Order]] of [[All]].

That which integrates within its Self the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] and the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goods]]. 

The [[One]] towards Which and through to Whom which we are advancing and returning.
