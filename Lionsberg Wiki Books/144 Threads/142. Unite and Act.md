# 142. Unite and Act

Unity is the foundation of power, and action is its expression. To [[Unite and Act]] is to bring humanityâ€™s collective genius to bear on the challenges and opportunities We face, co-creating a future where [[All]] beings flourish in harmony. Action without unity scatters; unity without action stagnates. Together, they form the alchemy of transformation.
