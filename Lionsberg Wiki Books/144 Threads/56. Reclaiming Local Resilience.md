# 56. Reclaiming Local Resilience

The fragility of global supply chains and the artificial scarcity of fiat currencies have revealed the need for local self-sufficiency and exchange. Food, water, and energy security must be reclaimed at the community level, along with the basic economic and manufacturing capabilities required to provision key goods. AI, robotics, and [[Additive Manufacturing]] will be key to relocalization, along with a revitalization of traditional craftsmanship before the skills are lost. Building resilience is not a return to isolation but an embrace of interdependent strength that aligns local innovation with global solidarity. Crucially, localities that abide by the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]] will be able to participate in bioregional and planetary flows of resources and information.
