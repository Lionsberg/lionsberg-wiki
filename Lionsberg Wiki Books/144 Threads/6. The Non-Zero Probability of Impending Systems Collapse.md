# 6. The Non-Zero Probability of Impending Systems Collapse

Many of the systems We depend on—food, finance, energy, religion, information and governance—are interconnected like a delicate web, but this web was spun for [[Kontrolle]], not resilience. Imagine a global socioeconomy built on quicksand, where a single disruption can trigger cascading failures. Supply chains fracture, currencies crumble, and governments and dogmas falter under their own weight. Collapse is no longer a distant possibility; it is a looming certainty unless We act decisively. The choice is stark: continue on this unsustainable path towards ruin, or awaken, unite, and co-create regenerative [[New]] systems that honor and align with life and Source ItSelf. To delay is to gamble with the survival of billions.
