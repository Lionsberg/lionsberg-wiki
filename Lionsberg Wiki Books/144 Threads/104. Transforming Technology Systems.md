# 104. Transforming Technology Systems

Technology has the power to either liberate or enslave. As We approach the [[Technological Singularity]]—where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, reshaping life and society as We know it—this transformative threshold demands a profound redefinition of humanity’s relationship with technology. The potential for AI and advanced systems to amplify human creativity, solve global challenges, and regenerate the planet is extraordinary, but so too are the risks of misuse, dependence, and existential threats to sovereignty.

[[Transforming Technology Systems]] requires embedding [[Wisdom]] and [[Universal Principles and Values]] into every aspect of technological design, governance, and application. AI must serve as a tool of co-creation, enhancing humanity’s ability to thrive in harmony with [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]]. This means ensuring these systems prioritize flourishing, connection, and regeneration over domination, exploitation, or control.

As humanity integrates the [[New Human Operating System]], the [[Critical Path]] includes shaping advanced technologies to align human existence with [[The Goal]] and [[Creator’s Intent]]. Only by consciously and collaboratively stewarding these innovations can We ensure they uplift life, deepen unity, and accelerate [[Progress]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]].
