# 74. The Creator’s Intent

The Creator’s intent is not hidden; it is revealed in the harmony of nature, the interconnectedness of life, the [[Logos]] of the universe, and the spark of Spirit and Consciousness within Us all. To align with this intent is to honor life’s intrinsic value, co-create in balance with the universe, and fulfill humanity’s role as co-creative custodians of Earth and the cosmos.
