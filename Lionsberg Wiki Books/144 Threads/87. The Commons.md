# 87. The Commons

The Earth’s resources are not commodities—they are commons, belonging to all beings and future generations. Reclaiming the commons means protecting and regenerating the shared foundations of life: air, water, soil, and knowledge. It also means transforming paradigms of ownership and exploitation into paradigms of fractal stewardship on behalf of all past, present, and future generations. [[Lionsberg Commons]].
