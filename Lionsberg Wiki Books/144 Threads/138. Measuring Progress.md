# 138. Measuring Progress

Progress is both an internal and external journey. [[Measuring Progress]] requires honesty, reflection, and alignment with the principles of life, the [[Way]], and [[The Goal]]. True progress transcends wealth, power, or production, manifesting instead through the flourishing of life, love, and unity among all beings. While a vast array of [[Quantitative]] measurements can be made of the [[Quality]] and [[Quantity]] of Life, Liberty, and Love We are co-creating, the true measurement of [[Progress]] is the [[Qualitative]] experience of [[Who We Are Becoming]] as We journey together towards [[The Goal]]. During the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], progress is primarily made as We [[Pass The Flame]] and encourage other to awaken, exit [[The Caves]], and set their feet on [[The Path]] towards [[The Goal]]. [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] are starting points to measure Our collective movement [[FROM the Old TO the New]].
