Transformation is not an end—it is a beginning. The Sacred Flame is the eternal Light of humanity’s Spirit, arising from Source—a Divine spark carried forward through every generation, capable of illuminating the darkest pathways and rekindling even the faintest hope. It is the torch We pass to those who follow, ensuring that the Divine light within Us all never fades. As We [[Pass The Flame]], each being become a Divine Light, dispelling the Darkness and illuminating the [[Way]].
