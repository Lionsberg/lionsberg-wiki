# 36. No One Involuntarily Left Behind

The migration of humanity and this planet [[FROM the Old TO the New]] must account for [[All]]. Not all may choose to walk [[The Path]] of awakening, but [[The Movement]] must ensure that no one is [[Involuntarily Left Behind]], honoring the dignity and potential of every soul. The [[New]] must embrace the vast diversity of human experience while upholding [[Universal Principles and Values]], offering support and opportunities for All to continually rediscover their optimal place within the ever-evolving Whole.
