# 86. The New Human Operating System

Humanity’s current ways of being—rooted in division, exploitation, and fear—must be upgraded. [[Refounding Civilization]] and [[Co-Creating The New World]] within a single generation will require unprecedented local and planetary coordination. The [[New Human Operating System]] is a paradigm shift toward interconnectedness, compassion, and co-creation, enabling humanity to confront and overcome the challenges and hand, and flourish into a future aligned with its highest potential and destiny. The [[LIONSBERG System]] was purpose built to enable this to manifest. It designed based on a [[Pattern Language]] and [[Protocols]] that enable [[Polycentric]] implementation, localization, and adaptation.
