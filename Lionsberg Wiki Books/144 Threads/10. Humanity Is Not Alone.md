# 10. Humanity Is Not Alone

From ancient scriptures to modern experience, the evidence is overwhelming: [[We Are Not Alone in the Universe]]. Non-human intelligences have shaped Our past, influenced Our present, and are vying for control of Our future. Some have guided Us, others have exploited Us, and the time has come to face this truth directly and transparently. Our future depends on understanding these relationships and reclaiming Our sovereignty.
