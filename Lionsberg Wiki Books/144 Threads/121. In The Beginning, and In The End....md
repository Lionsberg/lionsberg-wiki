# 121. In The Beginning, and In The End...

The story of humanity is a one brilliant thread within a tapestry that spans countless trillions of star systems and millions of life forms throughout the cosmos. In the beginning, [[All]] things emerged from the [[One]], and in the end, all things return to it. In between, [[All]] that manifests interexists as unique aspects of [[One Body]]. This eternal cycle of unfolding and enfolding reminds Us that [[The Journey]] is part of a Whole infinitely greater than any of its partsâ€”an ongoing Divine [[Autopoiesis]] that encompasses all existence.
