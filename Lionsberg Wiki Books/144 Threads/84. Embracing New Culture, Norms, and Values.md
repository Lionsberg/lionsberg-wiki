# 84. Embracing New Culture, Norms, and Values

The transformation of systems requires the transformation of culture—the Way We do things around here. By embracing values that prioritize love, truth, and life, humanity can cultivate a culture that uplifts all beings, fosters creativity, and aligns with the natural order. The transition [[FROM the Old TO the New]] calls for a profound cultural shift—FROM destructive norms that erode life and harmony TO regenerative Ways that heal, elevate, and unify Us All.
