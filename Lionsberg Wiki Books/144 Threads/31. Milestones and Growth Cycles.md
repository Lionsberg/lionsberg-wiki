# 31. Milestones and Growth Cycles

Transformation unfolds in cycles, each marked by [[Milestones]] that indicate [[Progress]]. These cycles, inspired by the harmony of natural and cosmic patterns, mark the progress of [[The Movement]] along the [[Critical Path]]. Each milestone reflects the journey of individuals and localities from awakening to empowerment and co-creation, gradually connecting their progress into a unified collective force advancing towards [[The Goal]]. By aligning Our strategies and actions with these rhythms, We can amplify their impact and ensure sustainable growth. Accomplishing these cycles of growth within the [[Critically Effective Time Limit]] allows Us to harness the momentum of a system on the brink—not only of collapse, but also of potential transformation—before it descends into disintegration. See [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]].
