# 54. Population Decline and Mass Migration

Global population dynamics are shifting. While some regions face overpopulation, others are experiencing birthrate declines, aging populations, and workforce shortages. Instability and [[Collapse]] create [[Human Osmotic Pressure]], fueling mass migrations and straining resources, systems, and local cultural norms. Declining populations are often unable to generate the resources required to care for the aging generations. [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] addresses this via the largest building project and resource redistribution in history, aimed at stabilizing each of the millions of around the world to prevent desperation and involuntary [[Migration]], while establishing a New [[Universal Citizenship]].
