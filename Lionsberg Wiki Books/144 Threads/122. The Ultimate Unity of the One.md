# 122. The Ultimate Unity of the One

Beneath the surface of [[Diversity]] lies an unbreakable [[Ultimate Unity]]. The [[One]] is the [[Source]] from which [[All]] life flows, the Divine essence that binds the cosmos into a single, coherent [[Whole]]. Recognizing this [[Ultimate Unity]] transforms Our understanding of Self and other, gradually reweaving Our [[Apparently Individuated Consciousness]] back into the sacred interexistent fabric of the ever-unfurling universe.
