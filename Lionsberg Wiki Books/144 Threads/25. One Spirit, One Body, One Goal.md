# 25. One Spirit, One Body, One Goal

The survival and flourishing of humanity depend on an evolutionary leap in unity. We must transcend divisions of nation, race, class, and creed to become a single superorganism; [[ONE Body]], animated by [[One Spirit]], pursuing [[One Goal]] in harmony with Our Selves, each other, and the cosmos. This unity does not erase individuality or locality; it reveals a Higher Order Functional Coherence where diversity becomes Our greatest strength, and co-creative flourishing becomes the [[New Normal]].
