# 132. The Interstellar Goal

Humanity’s purpose and destiny extends far beyond Earth and this local star systems. Becoming an interstellar species is not about escape but the continual expansion of life, consciousness, and light—fulfilling Our Divine mandate to bring life, love, and wisdom both to the farthest reaches of the Cosmos, and the innermost depths of Our Selves. Our journey to new stars and dimensions is the next step in humanity’s spiritual evolution, an acceptance of the Divine invitation to participate in the unfurling of life and consciousness in every realm We touch.
