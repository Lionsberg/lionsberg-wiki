# 141. Planning and Preparation

Awakening must lead to action. [[Planning and Preparation]] is the bridge between awakened vision and reality, requiring focus, discipline, and the courage to continually return to [[The Path]] and forthrightly face what lies ahead. To prepare is to align Our hearts, minds, and hands for the work of co-creative transformation. It is the translation of Divine revelation into philosophy, philosophy into theory, theory into strategy, and strategy into pragmatic plans and practices that can advance Us towards [[The Goal]].
