# 62. Collaborating with Non-Human Neighbors

Humanity is not alone in its struggle for survival and flourishing. Advanced non-human intelligences—some benevolent, others manipulative—are an undeniable part of Our reality. Building **[[Right Relationship]]** with these beings demands transparency, mutual respect, and a commitment to sovereignty, ensuring that humanity neither exploits nor becomes exploited.

However, the greatest threat may come from within. As humanity continues to develop **[[High Science Technology]]**—from advanced artificial intelligence to directed energy weapons and beyond—the temptation to weaponize these capabilities against Our Selves, [[One Another]], or surrounding cosmic civilizations poses an existential risk. History warns Us that such misuse of technology could lead to catastrophic outcomes, including self-destruction.

To avoid this peril, humanity and its cosmic neighbors must establish a framework of **[[Omniconsiderate]] [[Right Relationship]]** that governs the development and use of these technologies. This framework must align with the principles of life, truth, and harmony, ensuring that innovation uplifts rather than annihilates. **[[World War IV]]**—a war fought with technologies capable of ending all life on Earth and disrupting civilizations far Beyond—must be averted at all costs. Instead, We must prioritize co-creative solutions that foster peace, unity, and the shared flourishing of all beings, terrestrial and cosmic alike.
