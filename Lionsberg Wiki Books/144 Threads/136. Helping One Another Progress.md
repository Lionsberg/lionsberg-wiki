# 136. Helping One Another Progress

True progress is not a solitary pursuit; it is a sacred responsibility We share as [[Apparently Individuated]] aspects of the [[One]]. By [[Helping One Another]] rise—sharing wisdom, offering support, and healing wounds—We accelerate humanity’s journey and illuminate [[The Path]] for all beings. [[Spiraling Up]] together, We ascend far higher and faster than any could alone.
