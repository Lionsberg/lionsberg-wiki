# 73. Worksite Earth

Earth is not just Our home; it is a sacred worksiteâ€”a place for humanity to co-create, innovate, and flourish in harmony with life. Recognizing this truth calls Us to approach Our planet as a Whole with reverence and responsibility, transforming exploitation into stewardship and desecration into regeneration.
