# 81. Healing the Living System

The Earth and humanity are one living system, and the wounds of one are the wounds of both. Regeneration is not just ecological but spiritual and societal, requiring Us to restore harmony within and among [[All]] beings. Working together to heal and uplift the [[Living System]] that sustains life on [[Earth]] is humanityâ€™s most profound opportunity to express love, redemption, and realignment with the [[Creator's Intent]].
