# 17. The 10-Year Grand Strategy

The next decade is pivotal, with critical [[Milestones]] shaping Our trajectory. By 2026, [[The First Three Percent]] must be connected and empowered, forming a planetary grid of leadership, light, and love. By 2030, humanity must transition from crisis to healing and renewal. The [[3 Year Healing, Orientation, and Empowerment Process]] will guide individuals and communities through three pillars of transformation: spiritual awakening to reconnect with Life and Source, community building to restore trust and unity, and systemic transition to align with individually, locally, and bioregionally with regenerative principles. This process lays the foundation for thriving [[New Citizens]] within the emerging [[New Civilization]]. This paves the [[Way]] towards 2033, when We partake together in [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]]. This Meta Strategy, uniting Our collective wisdom and resources as [[One Body]] in co-creative partnership with the Divine, is not optionalâ€”it is Our only hope. The clock is ticking, and the time to act is now.
