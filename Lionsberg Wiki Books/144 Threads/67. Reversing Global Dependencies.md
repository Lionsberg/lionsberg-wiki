# 67. Reversing Global Dependencies

Globalization has created dependencies that undermine local resilience, sovereignty, and capacity. Reversing these trends does not mean isolation but fostering balanced exchange, local production, and networks that empower communities to stand strong locally when necessary, while collaborating harmoniously when possible. [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] calls for the establishment of local and bioregional [[Lionsberg Instantiation Hubs]] that ensure all resources and capabilities required to survive a [[Collapse]] of the [[Existing Order]] are locally available.
