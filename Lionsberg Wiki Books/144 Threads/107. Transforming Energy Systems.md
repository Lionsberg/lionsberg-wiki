# 107. Transforming Energy Systems

Energy systems must evolve from extractive and polluting to clean, abundant, and renewable. The advent of **[[New Energy]] technologies**—capable of providing virtually unlimited free energy to [[All]]—represents a profound turning point. These innovations will not only eliminate abject [[Poverty]] by ensuring universal access to energy but also render fossil fuels and their destructive legacy obsolete.

Beyond energy production, [[New Energy]] systems will lay the foundation for a unified [[Time Energy Accounting]] methodology. By replacing the distortions and inequities of hundreds of competing national currencies and accounting systems, this approach creates a transparent and just framework for valuing human and planetary effort. [[Time Energy Accounting]] redefines exchange, prioritizing regeneration, reciprocity, and [[Value]] aligned with [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].

The transformation of energy systems will power the regeneration of civilization and the healing of the Earth, enabling humanity to align its infrastructure and economy with the principles of life, regenerativity, and abundance. [[Transforming Energy Systems]] is not just an engineering challenge—it is a moral imperative and a cornerstone of the [[New Civilization]], and an early item in the [[System Wide Master Plan]].
