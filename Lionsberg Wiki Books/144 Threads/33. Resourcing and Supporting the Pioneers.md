# 33. Resourcing and Supporting the Pioneers

[[The Pioneers]]—the individuals and communities stepping forward to lead humanity’s transformation—must be resourced and supported. They are the seeds of the future, and their success is humanity’s success. Providing tools, knowledge, resources and solidarity to these pioneers is essential to nurturing [[The Movement]], and one of the most critical investments We can make. Their progress along the [[Critical Path]]—from awakening to co-creative empowerment—forges the foundation and paves the way for others to join, transforming the ripple of individual transformation into a wave of collective renewal.
