# 83. Co-Creating New Systems

The [[New]] cannot be imposed—it must be co-created. It must organically emerge through Our collective wisdom, intuition, and embodiment. New systems of governance, economy, education, and care must be co-created through collaborative innovation, guided by justice, harmony, and the regenerative principles of life ItSelf. These systems must express an entirely [[New]] [[Way of Being]] as a human species—a paradigm shift that enables humanity to flourish in [[Omniharmonic]] alignment with the [[Creator's Intent]]. *"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, **build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."*** - [[Buckminster Fuller]]
