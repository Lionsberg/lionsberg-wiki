# 133. The One Uniting Aim and Goal

The spiritual journey of all progressively enlightening beings is unified by a singular Ultimate Aim: the reawakening to [[ONE]] and the reunification of life with its Divine Purpose, Intention, and Goal. This aim is not the erasure of Our apparent individuality but its ecstatic transcendence, where each unique liberated being contributes in harmony to the unfolding Divine Symphony of [[ONE]], [[One Another]], and [[All]]. The coherent manifestation of this harmony is the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of [[All]] generations of Life and Consciousness co-creatively emanating from [[ONE]], advancing together as [[ONE Body]] towards [[The Goal]].
