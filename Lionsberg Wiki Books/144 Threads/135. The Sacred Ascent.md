# 135. The Sacred Ascent

[[The Sacred Ascent]] is the climb to the ever-receding heights of [[The Sacred Mountain]]; from fragmentation to unity, ignorance to wisdom, darkness to enlightenment, unconsciousness to consciousness, and egoic separation to Divine co-creation. It is a path of awakening that transcends ego, heals division, and elevates humanity into alignment and right relationship with the omniconsiderate [[Divine Order]] of life.
