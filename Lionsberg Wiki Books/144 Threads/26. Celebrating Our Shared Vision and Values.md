# 26. Celebrating Our Shared Vision and Values

Unity arises from a shared [[Vision]] of [[The Future]], and a foundation of the [[Universal Principles and Values]] that underpin it. Truth, love, justice, stewardship and wisdom must serve as the foundation of Our collective endeavor. These are not abstract idealsâ€”they are the principles that align humanity with the Creator and All Creation. By celebrating what unites Us, We can weave a tapestry of visionary hope that inspires and sustains the work ahead.
