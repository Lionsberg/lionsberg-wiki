# 23. The Default Trajectory Towards Collapse, Chaos, and Tyranny

The path of least resistance leads directly to ruin. Left unchecked, the current trajectory will deliver escalating environmental devastation, economic collapse, and totalitarian control. This is the default: a slide into chaos, tyranny, and despair. To reap hell on earth, We need only to do nothing. Only radical intervention—grounded in truth, love, and wise collective action—can change course. The future will not wait; We must rise now to redirect humanity and this planet toward flourishing, abundance, and liberation.
