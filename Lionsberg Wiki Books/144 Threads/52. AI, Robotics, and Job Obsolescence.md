# 52. AI, Robotics, and Job Obsolescence

Technological advancements promise efficiency but threaten livelihoods. When applied to inherently degenerative systems, misaligned technologies will accelerate humanity and the planet towards [[Collapse]]. AI and robotics are poised to render millions of jobs obsolete, creating economic instability and social unrest. The solution is not resistance to technology but the co-creation of wisely stewarded and governed systems where automation serves humanity, [[One]] and [[All]], freeing Us for ever more meaningful creativity, growth, and purpose. [[The Final Order]] is based on the assumption that [[The Few]] will own and control the advanced technology, and therefore humanity and planet. This must be resisted at all costs.
