# 88. The Prototype

The journey to global transformation begins with localized prototypesâ€”living examples of regenerative systems and communities. These prototypes serve as beacons, demonstrating what is possible and inspiring widespread adoption of solutions that work. The [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] calls for these local patterns of success to be pushed up and curated into an interoperable [[Kit of Parts]] called [[The Prototype]]. In this Way, [[The Prototype]] learns from every local instantiation, and can subsequently be "downloaded", localized, and adapted relatively simultaneously and polycentrically around the planet.
