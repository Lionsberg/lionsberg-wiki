# 46. Exchanging Diplomatic Recognition

As the New emerges, it must engage with the Old. Diplomatic recognition—based on mutual respect and shared principles—helps create the conditions for peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, and cooperation. As [[Lionsberg]] emerges, it will exchange [[Diplomatic Recognition]] with various aligned entities of Earth and beyond, without every sacrificing its [[Sovereignty]]. By cycle 40, at which point [[The First Three Percent]] are engaged, this network of interconnected sovereigns and communities could represent one of the five largest [[Sovereignties]] on Earth, signaling a profound realignment of global priorities and values (see [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]]). These milestones are not about dominance or control but about the voluntary and harmonic realignment of humanity with [[Universal Principles and Values]].
