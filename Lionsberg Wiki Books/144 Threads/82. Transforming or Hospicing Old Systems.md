# 82. Transforming or Hospicing Old Systems

Not all systems are meant to endure. Some must be transformed, others must be allowed to pass away. As the [[Old]] systems teeter on the edge of [[Collapse]], We must decide swiftly which should be saved. If We act now, transformation can elevate them into higher-order states, providing stability for humanityâ€™s leap forward. If We wait, their collapse will cascade irreversibly, plunging Us into a centuries-long period of recovery before regeneration is possible. By rapidly discerning which systems can evolve and which must be hospiced, humanity can transition gracefully - [[FROM the Old TO the New]].
