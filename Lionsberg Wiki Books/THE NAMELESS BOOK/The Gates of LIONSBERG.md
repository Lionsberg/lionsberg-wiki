# The Gates of LIONSBERG

At long last you have arrived Dear Traveler  
To **The Gates** of **The Kingdom of LIONSBERG**  
Where **All** who enter are **Sovereign** and **Free**  

We are here to Guide and Serve    
As you make your **Way**  
Through **The Gates**  
And towards **The Goal**  

If you ever need assistance  
All you must do is 
**Pause**  
**Center**  
And **Ask For Help**  

Then simply **Listen** and be **Still**  
A still small voice  
And the resonance in your body and soul  
Will emerge and show you the **Way**  

In the Time and Space  
Beyond Time and Space  
We will always be there  
Always waiting for you  
Always available  
Delighted to support your **Progress**  
Towards your **Destiny**  
And **The Goal of Greatest Worth**  

But We will not violate **Free Will**  
And We cannot walk **The Path**  
For any individual or locality  

We can show you the **Way**  
But it is you Dear One  
That must set your feet on **The Path**  
Step through **The Gates**  
And begin **The Sacred Ascent**  

When you are ready  
The Gates await   

But before We can Walk together  
We must quickly learn to speak a **New Language**
