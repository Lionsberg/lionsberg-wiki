To the Nameless Movement 

It will be a transmissible gateway and guide  
Into [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] — 
The Way the Nameless Movement advances  
FROM Here to TO There  

1. [[The Threshold]] will lead into [[The Gates]]  
2. [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]] in turn will guide Pilgrims step by step through 
3. [[The Story]] (Narrative, Vision, Values, Goal, Who, and Why) 
4. [[The Great Game]] (How / Doing) 
5. The Way / [[The Sacred Ascent]] (Being / Becoming)  
6. The Codex (Living constitution, etc.)

- A Sentence  
- A Principle  
- A Gift  
- A Practice  
- A Quest  
- A Measure  
- A Seal
