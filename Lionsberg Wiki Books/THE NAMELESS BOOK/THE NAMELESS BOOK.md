There is no one way to awaken a species, liberate a world, or design and build a new civilization.   

It is as much art as architecture; as much play as project, as much story as system.  

In the end it is about participation in Spirit with the Divine life that is trying to emerge through us. It is about a Way for ordinary people to consciously practice a **New Civilization** into existence — before the old systems collapse into **chaos and tyranny by design**. 

There is a nameless cosmic movement towards flourishing and abundant life, now awakening the souls of Earth and beckoning **All** to remember **We Are One Body**. No one owns the universal movement. Like the **ONE** it **All** originates from it is ultimately ineffable, transcendent, and inclusive of all names. 

Yet there are times when Spirit is not enough; 
when shared intention must actually take form;  
when vision must actually be brought into reality;  
when worlds must actually be regenerated and restored.  

These times require not only Spirit, but also skill;  
not only courage, but also competence;  
not only community, but also coordination; 
not only willingness, but also work.  

The New Civilization we are **playing into being** must *actually work*. 

Thus the imagination, design, and building of a New Civilization should be undertaken with no less skillful precision than is common to any major human endeavor. 

LIONSBERG is a free open source system, process, and protocol **purpose built to enable this**. There is no central organization to join. There is no one to pay. There is no one to complain to, criticize, or tell you what to do. 

It is simply a set of patterns and a Way of being, designing, and building that brings that brings Heaven to any world that learns to embody it.

While its true history stretches out into the stars, [[LIONSBERG - History, Inception, and Trust Manifesto]] shares the story of LIONSBERG's incarnation and adaptation to Earth through the life and work of [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a planetary+ network of allies. 

This Nameless Book is our ongoing attempt to simplify and reduce the ~3 million words J left behind into an immediately understandable and actionable form.

## How To Begin 

There is a well known saying among masters of the Way: 

> **_To know the Way, One must live it_**

If you attempt to grasp LIONSBERG intellectually before beginning, it is nearly certain that you will fail or turn away. The only Way to know and understand its power and potential is to step into the story, play the game, and allow the Spirit and patterns to unfold through you. 

The entire system is built around the concept of **Circles** — small self-governing, self-sustaining, self-replicating "cells" of 3 to 12 individuals. Autonomous small groups of passionate people are how the world transforms. 

To begin, invite 2 to 12 people to a physical or digital gathering, and read aloud the following four pages. A 90 minute gathering will allow for about 30 minutes of reading, and 60 minutes of dialogue and sensemaking. 

1. [[The LIONSBERG Quick Start Guide]]  
2. [[Prologue to The Story and The Great Game]]  
3. [[The Story of LIONSBERG]]  
4. [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]]  

From there, [[The LIONSBERG Playbook]] and [[The Lionsberg Co-Creator's Handbook]] provide guidance on how to co-operate as a high quality, effective team of teams.  

[[Frequently Asked Questions]] addresses many of the most common questions and concerns. 

That is all for now. As the first **Circles** choose **Quests** and get into **Play**, additional information will be added as it is needed and requested.
