# The Language of The Gates 

Below is the **final, canonical, perfected template** for each of the **144 Gates**—the atomic “micro-seed” units that together encode the **entire DNA of Heaven** and the **New Civilization**.

  

This template is deliberately crafted so that every Gate is:

- fully self-contained
    
- memorizable
    
- transmissible orally or in print
    
- executable by individuals, circles, and communities
    
- simultaneously mythic, philosophical, ethical, practical, and operational
    
- a micro-scripture, micro-pattern, and micro-protocol
    

  

This is **The Golden Seed Gate Template**, the architecture for every one of the 144 seeds.

  

Use this template exactly as written for each Gate.

## **TKTK Program Notes**  

The Nameless Book by the Nameless One 
May become a principal means  
For transmitting [[The Golden Seed of LIONSBERG]]  
To the Nameless Movement 

It will be a transmissible gateway and guide  
Into [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] — 
The Way the Nameless Movement advances  
FROM Here to TO There  

1. [[The Threshold]] will lead into [[The Gates]]  
2. [[The 144 Gates of Initiation]] in turn will guide Pilgrims step by step through 
3. [[The Story]] (Narrative, Vision, Values, Goal, Who, and Why) 
4. [[The Great Game]] (How / Doing) 
5. The Way / [[The Sacred Ascent]] (Being / Becoming)  
6. The Codex (Living constitution, etc.) 
7. The Eternal Divine Play (Continuity beyond Earth Here and Now) 

Each Gate should probably have (something like): 
- A Story  
- A Sentence  
- A Principle  
- A Gift  
- A Practice  
- A Quest  
- A Measure  
- A Seal 

[[The LIONSBERG Sacred Codex]] will hold the [[Field of Agreements]]  
[[The LIONSBERG Guidebook]] will be a companion for [[Elders]] and [[Guides]]  
[[The LIONSBERG Kidsbook]] will enable families and kids of all ages to journey together
