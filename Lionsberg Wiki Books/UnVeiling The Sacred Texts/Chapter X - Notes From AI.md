They are characterized as "Big Nosed Grays," standing approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, with gray or tan skin, large black slanted eyes with yellow vertical pupils, a mushroom-like head, and a prominent beaked nose. They reportedly possess four long fingers and may originate from the planet **Pontel**, near the Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy

#### 4. Ebens

**Ebens** are one of the most discussed alleged extraterrestrial species in modern UFO lore, particularly associated with the **Majestic 12 documents**, the **Serpo Project**, and other whistleblower claims. The term "Ebens" is derived from **Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs)**, which reportedly describes a race of beings connected to UFO crash retrievals, including the **Roswell Incident**.

    - Some accounts suggest the Ebens may have manipulated human genetics in the distant past, alongside their co-creation of a number of different species including the [[Archquloids]].  
    - The Ebens are sometimes described as "caretakers" or "observers" of humanity's evolution.
