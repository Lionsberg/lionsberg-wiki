# Chapter 3 - Yahweh - A Capricious Created Being

While the Old Authorities corrupted and whitewashed the [[Source Narratives]] to paint [[Yahweh]] as the Supreme Creator / God / Ultimate Reality, The Story makes far more sense when We recognize that Yahweh is a created male being, one among many [[Elohim]], who is tyrannical, genocidal, and capricious. 

It is not merely one or two tyrannical, vengeful acts that come across as worse than the worst of human tyrants; it is the through-line of Yahweh's personality and character. 

Multiple figures in the early church sought to distance the emerging legacy of Jesus from the capricious Elohim of the Jewish stories, accurately pointing out that in order to accept them, We would have to believe of God "such things as we would not believe of the most savage and unjust of men." (Origin).

## Crimes Against Humanity

- **Arbitrary and Collective Punishments:** Entire groups, including innocents, are viciously punished for the actions of a few.
- **Systematic Genocide, Violence and Cruelty:** Yahweh repeatedly commands the slaughter of men, women, children, and animals.
- **Violence Against Innocents:** Many of Yahweh’s actions involve punishing innocents, such as children or entire populations.
- **Excessive Retribution:** Minor offenses or improper conduct often result in extreme and lethal consequences.
- **Favoritism and Partiality:** Commands often reflect tribal loyalty and disregard for the well-being of others.
- **Rape and Sexual Exploitation:** Many passages involve Yahweh permitting or commanding the capture and sexual exploitation of women. 
- **Endorsement of Cruelty and Oppression:** Yahweh’s commands and tyrannical example perpetuate systems of ignorance, cruelty, and oppression, particularly against women and foreigners.

- **Violence Against Infants, Women and Children:** Yahweh's commands and judgments often involve disproportionate and brutal violence against the most vulnerable, such as pregnant women and infants.

As Jesus said: *"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You shall know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, you will know them by their fruits."*
