# Chapter 6 - Yahweh and the Multiplicity of Elohim

Now that We understand a bit more of the linguistic and historical context of the misinterpretations, We can begin to look at the biblical representations of the underlying [[Source Narratives]] with New Eyes. 

The ancient stories of the Hebrew, Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Akkadian, Phoenician (et al) tribes all seem to be describing the same phenomenon of this class of overlords from above, who are capricious, exploitative, oppressive, and morally inconsistent. 

The **Phoenicians**, like tribes around the world, were infamous for practices like child sacrifice demanded by their [[Elohim]] (like **Moloch**), which are echoed in Hebrew traditions where Yahweh demands severe offerings, including the firstborn children. 

The common narratives and experiences among these adjacent tribes suggest that various Elohim tyrannically influenced the ritual and sacrificial norms across cultures. 

Despite modern Christian, Muslim, and sometimes Jewish interpretations that the plural Elohim refers to the "royal we", or "the trinity", or the One, in the original story passed down by grandparents to grandchildren, the word Elohim was understood to represent a diversity of powerful beings that interacted with the Hebrews and surrounding tribes. 

In the Hebrew cannon, and the experiential understanding of a vast diversity of tribes around the world, there is a juridical body referred to as the "Sky Council", in which a plurality of [[Elohim]] sit in council together. Reference for instance Psalm 82 "Elohim takes his stand in the congregation of the El... among the Elohim he judges."

Understanding Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, as one among a multiplicity of male and female Elohim interacting with humanity (such as the Moabite elohim Chemosh, the Sidonian elohim Astarte), brings things into an entirely New Light, while resolving a number of the spiritual and moral questions that have confounded "believers" over centuries, such as: 

- Why the Elohim command and commit such brutal and unconscionable acts   
	- Which does not make sense if God is perfectly Loving, Just and Good  
- Why humans are killed in conflicts between the Elohim  
	- Which does not make sense if Elohim refers to a Singularity   

This rejection of the false interpretations and mistranslations of the Old Authorities resolves the pressing questions of why a "Holy God" or "Holy Trinity" that is perfect and unchangingly Good would command theft, rape, murder, genocide, enslavement, etc. as cited in the 30+ examples in [[Chapter 3 - Yahweh - A Capricious Created Being]].  

To further clarify the distinction between **Yahweh (יהוה)** and the broader category of divine beings referred to as **Elohim (אלהים)** or other similar terms, it is essential to delve into the Hebrew Bible’s nuanced portrayal of "the powerful ones from above". 

The following 20 passages demonstrate that Yahweh, though clearly the head Elohim of Israel, is presented as one among many real, living, and active Elohim in the ancient Near Eastern context of a plurality of "powerful ones from above". Each example is supplemented with the original Hebrew terminology for clarity.
  
**1. Deuteronomy 32:8–9**

• _“When the Most High (עליון, Elyon) apportioned the nations, He divided humankind; He fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of the Elohim (בני אלהים, benei Elohim). But Yahweh’s portion is His people, Jacob His allotted heritage.”_

• This passage implies that **Elyon** assigned nations to the sons of the Elohim, with Yahweh, one of these beings, receiving Israel as his inheritance. 

**2. Psalm 82:1**

• _“(god)(אלהים, Elohim) stands in the divine council (עדת־אל, adat-El); He judges among the gods (אלהים, Elohim).”_

• Here, an **Elohim** presides over a council of other **Elohim**, highlighting a multiplicity of divine beings in council.

**3. Exodus 12:12**

• _“And I will bring judgment on all the gods (אלהי, elohei) of Egypt; I am Yahweh.”_

• Yahweh, an Elohim, explicitly acts against the gods (elohei) of Egypt, indicating a conflict among the Elohim, and categorizing them with the same noun.

**4. Genesis 6:2**

• _“The sons of the Elohim (בני האלהים, benei ha-Elohim) saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they took wives for themselves.”_

• The **benei ha-Elohim** are distinct divine beings.
- Note again Deuteronomy 32:8–9, where Elyon divides up the Earth among the **benei Elohim**.  
- Also note that certain Elohim, who made human beings "in their image", are literally and physiologically reproductively compatible with human women. 
- [[EXISTENTIAL THREAT - Are You Curious What Lurks Behind The Veil?]] addresses in more detail the ongoing interbreeding, hybridization, and genetic engineering of these beings. 

**5. Judges 11:24**

• _“Do you not possess what Chemosh (כמוש) your god (אלהיך, eloheikha) has given you? So we will possess everything that Yahweh our god (יהוה אלהינו, Yahweh Eloheinu) has given us.”_

• Yahweh is treated as one Elohei among others, with Chemosh named as another Elohim who rules over Moab.

**6. Numbers 21:29**

• _“Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, people of Chemosh (כמוש)! He has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity.”_

• Chemosh is again acknowledged as a real Elohim with dominion over Moab, distinct from Yahweh.

**7. Psalm 89:5–7**

- *"The heavens praise Your wonders, Yahweh, Your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones (קָהַל קְדוֹשִׁים, qahal qedoshim). For who in the skies can compare with Yahweh? Who among the sons of God (בְּנֵי אֵלִים, benei elim) is like Yahweh, (אֵל גָּדוֹל, El gadol)?"*  
- Yahweh is here compared to other divine beings in the same category (sons of elim), indicating that He is one of the sons of an Elohim, and not alone.

**8. Deuteronomy 4:19**

• _“And beware lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun, moon, and stars, all the host of heaven (צבא השמים, tz’va ha-shamayim), and bow down to them and serve them, which Yahweh your (god) (eloheka) has allotted to all the (peoples under the whole of heaven).”_

• Other divine entities, associated with specific celestial bodies, are assigned to various tribes and peoples by Yahweh.
- The passages seem to indicate that a superior being to Yahweh gave him authority over certain areas, and that Yahweh also allocates various peoples and domains to certain other Elohim. 

**9. 1 Kings 22:19–22**

• _“I saw Yahweh sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven (צבא השמים, tz’va ha-shamayim) standing by Him.”_

• This describes a divine council of other beings alongside Yahweh.  
- Same wording as the "host of heaven" in Deuteronomy 4:19, to whom Yahweh assigns various tribes.   

**10. Exodus 15:11**

• _“Who is like You among the gods (באלים, ba-elim), Yahweh?”_

• Yahweh is praised as one of many elim, who is superior in the eyes of the author to the others. 
- Similar to Psalms 89:5-7 _“Who among the sons of (god / elim) (בני אלים, benei elim) is like Yahweh?”_  
- Yahweh is characterized as a son of a higher Elim, and one among many Elim. 

**11. Psalm 96:4–5**

• _“For great is Yahweh and most worthy of praise; He is to be feared above all gods (מכל אלהים, Elohim). For all the gods (Elohei) of the nations (כל־אלהי העמים, kol **elohei** ha-amim) are (elilim).”_

• Cites the existence of numerous other Elohei, among whom Yahweh is superior in the eyes of the Author.

**12. 2 Kings 3:26-27**

- _"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took his firstborn son... and offered him as a sacrifice on the wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land."_
- _“Then he (the king of Moab) took his firstborn son and offered him as a sacrifice to Chemosh (כמוש).”_

- This act is effective, suggesting Chemosh’s real existence, power, and demands.  
- The king of Moab sacrifices his son to Chemosh, leading to Israel’s retreat, suggesting Chemosh’s intervention.
- Child and human sacrifice to the Elohim were commonly demanded, as previously cited for instance in the Hebrew and Phoenician stories. 
- Chemosh is portrayed as a powerful Elohim capable of influencing events.

**13. Deuteronomy 32:16–17**

• _“They made him jealous with strange gods (באל זרים, ba-el zarim); they sacrificed to demons (שדים, shedim), not (god) (אלוה, Eloah), to gods (אלהים, Elohim) they had not known.”_

• Yahweh is again distinguished as one jealous Elohim among many, distinct from other Elohim and entities occasionally worshiped by Israel.

**14. Isaiah 24:21**

• _“On that day, Yahweh will punish the host of the heights (צבא המרום, tz’va ha-marom) in heaven and the kings of the earth on earth.”_

• Yahweh battles and punishes other Elohim, reinforcing the idea of divine plurality and conflict. 

**15. Psalm 58:1**

• _“Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods (אלם, elim)? Do you judge mankind fairly?”_

• Other (gods) (elim), including Yahweh, are addressed and questioned directly.

**16. Genesis 35:2**

• _“Get rid of the foreign gods (אלהי הנכר, **elohei** ha-nechar) you have with you, and purify yourselves.”_

• Jacob acknowledges the existence of other gods / elohei, and calls Israel to separate from them.

**17. 2 Samuel 7:23**

• _“Who is like Your people Israel, the one nation on earth that their (god) (אלהים, Elohim) redeemed?”_

• Reinforces Yahweh as the Elohim of Israel, and other tribes with their own Elohim. 

**18. Exodus 20:3**

• _“You shall have no other gods (אלהים אחרים, **Elohim** acherim) before Me.”_

• The command assumes the existence of other gods / elohim, and the jealous demand for supremacy by Yahweh.

**19. Zephaniah 2:11**

• _“Yahweh will be awesome against them; He will destroy all the gods (אלהי, **elohei**) of the earth.”_

• Yahweh again acts against other gods, suggesting plurality and conflict.  

**20. Psalm 82:6**

• _“I said, ‘You are gods (אלהים, **Elohim**), sons of the Most High (בני עליון, benei **Elyon**), all of you.’”_

• Indicates, similar to Deuteronomy 32:8–9, a plurality of divine beings in apparent family dynasty, who are subordinate to Elyon.
- Note similarities to Enki, Enlil, and the other sons and daughters of Anu.

**21. 1 Kings 22:19–23**

- _"I saw Yahweh sitting on His throne, with all the host of heaven (צְבָא הַשָּׁמַיִם, tz’va ha-shamayim) standing around Him on His right and on His left. And Yahweh said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"_
- _"Finally, a spirit ([hā-rū-aḥ](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/haruach_7307.htm "ha·Ru·ach,: A spirit -- Occurrence 6 of 19.")) came forward, stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice him.' Yahweh said to him, 'Go and do it.'"_
- Yahweh interacts with a council of heavenly beings (Elohim or spirits) to plan Ahab’s downfall. One spirit volunteers to be a lying spirit in Ahab’s prophets.
    - The host of heaven includes real divine beings, who deliberate, negotiate, and interfere in the affairs of humankind.

**22. Isaiah 14:13-14**

- _You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim); I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High (עֶלְיוֹן, Elyon).'"_
- The antagonist (often interpreted as the king of Babylon or a fallen divine being / Eholihm) aspires to be like Elyon, above the stars of the Elohim, on the mount of the (divine) assembly. This indicates Elyon’s separate and supreme role in the divine hierarchy of Elohim.

**23. 2 Kings 1:1–4**

- **King Ahaziah’s Inquiry to Baal-Zebub**
    - _"After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel. Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, 'Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the (god)/(elohe) of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.'"_
- **Yahweh’s Response**
    - _"But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, 'Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no (god)/(אֵין אֱלֹהִים, ein Elohim) in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the (god)/(elohe) of Ekron?’ Therefore, this is what Yahweh says: 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!' So Elijah went."_
- This rhetorical question highlights Yahweh’s anger at being bypassed in favor of a foreign Elohim, emphasizing His demand for exclusive worship and loyalty from Israel.

**24. Joshua 24:14–15**

1. **Joshua’s Challenge**
    - _"Now fear Yahweh and serve Him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh."_
2. **Choice Between Elohim**
    - _"But if serving Yahweh seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods (אֱלֹהִים, Elohim) of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh."_
- The Elohim served by the ancestors beyond the Euphrates likely refer to the Mesopotamian deities, such as **Anu**, **Enlil**, and **Inanna/Ishtar**, from the Sumerian and Akkadian pantheon.
- This phrase recalls the ancestral worship of Terah, Abraham’s father, who was from Ur in Mesopotamia (_Genesis 11:27–28_).
- The acknowledgement of the other local Elohim as part of the Israel's religious and cultural history is crucial to accurately piecing back together The Story, and weaving back together the [[Source Narratives]] the biblical summary and redaction is drawn from. 

**25. Job 1:6–7; 2:1**

- _"Now there was a day when the sons of (god/gods/Elohim) (בְּנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים, benei ha-Elohim) came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan (הַשָּׂטָן, ha-satan) also came among them. Yahweh said to Satan, 'Where have you come from?'"_
- The **sons of God** (benei ha-Elohim) assemble before Yahweh, and **Satan** is portrayed as one of these divine beings participating in the council.
- This scene suggests a **formal assembly** of divine beings, reflecting their role in overseeing human activities.

**26. Ezekiel 1**

- "Now it came about... while I was by the river Chebar... the heavens were opened and I saw visions of [[Elohim]]... As I looked, behold a high wind was coming... a great cloud with fire flashing intermittently and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like gleaming metal in the midst of the fire. And within it there were figured resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance: they had human form... in the midst of the living beings was something that looked like burning coals of fire... and lightening was flashing from the fire... Now above... was something resembling a throne... and on which... was a figure with the appearance of a man. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the (kebowd) of Yahweh."   
- Here Yahweh appears to Ezekial in a (craft or vessel) alongside four other humanoid beings (Elohim). 
- The phrase translated "glory of god" in English is actually Yahweh's Kebod  ([kə-ḇō-wḏ-](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/kevod_3519.htm "ke·Vod-: of the glory -- Occurrence 28 of 39.")) of [Yah-weh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/yahweh_3068.htm "Yah·weh;: of the LORD -- Occurrence 5531 of 6218.")) in Hebrew. Hebrew scholars do not actually know what a Kebod is. 
- The appearance of Yahweh's Kebod is often accompanied by space-craft like descriptions, and Yahweh often speaks from it. For example: 
	- Exodus 16:10 "And it came about, as Aaron spoke... that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, Yahweh's Kebod appeared in the cloud. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying..."
	- Numbers 16:42: "It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled... that they turned towards the tent of meeting, and behold, suddenly the cloud covered it, and Yahweh's Kebod appeared... and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying "Get away from among this congregation so that I may consume them instantly."" 
	- Ezekiel 10:4 "Then Yahweh's Kebod went up from the cherub (and paused over) the treshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh's Kebod... the cherubim appeared to have something like a human hand under their wings... as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar." 
		- Here again Yahweh descends and ascends in his Kebod, along with the same four other beings / elohim. 
	- Ezekiel 11:23: "And went up Yahweh's Kebod from the midst of the city, and stood over the mountain which is easy of the city." 
	- Ezekiel 43:2: "And behold, Yahweh's Kebod was coming from the way of the east... And it was like the appearance of the vision ... which I saw when he came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar... and Yahweh said, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne... where I will dwell... inform the house of Israel if the temple... and have them measure the plan. And if they are ashamed of everything that they have done, make known to them the plan of the house, its layout, its exits, its entrances, all the plans, all its statutes, and all its laws... so they may observe its entire plan and execute it. This is the law of the house: its entire area on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy... these are the statutes for the altar... to offer burnt offerings and sprinkle blood on it..."  
		- Here again we see Yahweh apparently arriving in a physical craft with the other pilots, providing precise instructions for a physical house to be built for him, along with precise sacrifices and offerings he requires, which elsewhere includes their first born children. 
		- Note the parallel child sacrifice activity which the Elohim of adjacent tribes also demand, and the parallel war-faring actions of the other Elohim. 


**27. Zechariah 3:1–2**

- _"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan (הַשָּׂטָן, ha-satan) standing at his right side to accuse him. Yahweh said to Satan, 'Yahweh rebuke you, Satan!'"_
- ha-satan is here again depicted as a member of a **heavenly court**, where he serves as an accuser in a judicial setting presided over by Yahweh.
 - This reflects a **formal assembly of [[Elohim]]**, where decisions about human affairs are deliberated. Note the parallels to Job, where the sons of god, including ha-satan, formally assemble before Yahweh. 

**Summary Observations:**

1. **Multiplicity of Elohim:** The texts frequently refer to **Elohim**, **elim**, and **shedim** as distinct beings, with a multiplicity of each.

2. **Yahweh’s Supremacy, Not Exclusivity:** Yahweh is depicted as superior in the eyes of the authors to the other benei Elyon (sons of the most high), but not alone as the only Elohim.

3. **Regional and Tribal Deities:** The Bible and other contemporary texts often acknowledge the other Elohim as real entities with real territorial power and demands of the humans they dominate and exploit. The multiplicity of **Elohim** and other entities in these texts are portrayed as real, powerful beings with specific roles (e.g., judging nations, warring, or reporting).

4. **Divine Conflict:** Yahweh engages in cosmic struggles with other Elohim, reinforcing the notion of a divine hierarchy, jealousy and rivalry.

5. **Core Idea of a Sky Council of "the gods"**:
    - These passages consistently depict a **hierarchical assembly** of divine beings, with Yahweh (or Elyon in earlier traditions) as the presiding authority.
    - During the redaction process and theological drift towards monotheism, the characteristics of supremacy slowly aggregated to Yahweh. 
    - Yahweh may also have ascended over time in rank, after the territories and tribes of Earth were allotted by Elyon. 

6. **Ancient Near Eastern Context**: The **divine council** mirrors the structure of pantheons in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, such as the council of **El and Baal** in Ugaritic, Anu, Enlil, and Enki, the Annunaki, etc. 

These passages reveal the rich theological complexity of the Hebrew Bible and suggest a worldview in the original [[Source Narratives]] where Yahweh is one among many "powerful ones from above" dominating and influencing human affairs.  

These stories perfectly match the lived experiences of a vast diversity of tribes from every continent of the world, who have been consistently informed, instructed, and manipulated by a diversity of "powerful ones from above".
