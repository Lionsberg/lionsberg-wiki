# The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan

In the various [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], we have circumambulated the [[New Vision and Plan]] in detail from various angles. 

This presentation aims to approach (the whole) from the lens of a unified strategy and plan to meet this moment in history. 

It is intentionally designed to remain an eternally incomplete [[Work In Progress]], designed to be continuously improved by each individual and locality that joins [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## History and Inception 

In 2017, [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] began discussions with advisors regarding an Omni-Considerate and Omni-Encompassing Vision, Strategy, and Plan to meet this moment in [[The Story]], and usher humanity safely into a [[New Era]]. 

## Context 

The context was presumed to be a time of [[Meta Crisis]] in the 2020s, where the systems and existing order would shake and reorder in unprecedented ways. 

It was presumed that the existing trajectory was towards [[Collapse]], but that *before* the existing order collapsed, there was a brief period of [[Time]] during which the [[Human System]] could potentially leap forward into some kind of Higher Order Functional Unity that would enable it to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

## Scope of Work

The scope of work inherently encompasses the entirety of the human species and [[Worksite Earth]] without exception, and the expansion of the human species beyond Earth into inter-planetary and eventually inter-stellar configurations. 

It involves inviting inviting all humanity, roughly [[10 Billion People In 10 Years]], to make their [[Way]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]], and take up an [[Equal Citizenship]] in a fully regenerating, flourishing, and abundant Future. 

## Reintegration of the Human System and Living System 

Encompassing [[All]] Creation, the strategy and plan calls for the reintegration of the [[Human System]] *in service of* the eternally regenerative [[Living System]], or Universe, it is a part of. 

This requires that the [[Human System]] *itself* be transformed FROM [[Degenerative]] TO [[Regenerative]], empowered by a [[New Human Operating System]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] was created to serve this purpose. 

## Designer's Intent, and Creator's Intent

Like any System or Project, Lionsberg is created *in service of* an Overarching and Uniting Intention, Vision, and Goal. 

On any Worksite, this is legally and philosophically the notion of [[Designer's Intent]]. 

For this [[Meta Project]] encompassing [[All Creation]], it is the notion of [[Creator's Intent]]. 

By [[Creator]], we are referring to [[Ultimate Reality]], or what in English we often call [[God]]; the Generative Source and Sustainer of the [[Universe]] of [[All Creation]]. 

## Patterns of Success, and a Pattern Language of Success

The successful and proper co-operating of the human species in service of eternally regenerative Universe requires a shift in our Way, or Pattern, of Being. 

A Way of being that remains consistent and modulates itself across Time and Space is perhaps best conceptualized as a set of [[Domain Independent]] Patterns. 

Sets of Domain Independent Patterns are most coherently integrated and composed via a [[Pattern Language]]. 

In this case, we are searching for the most Timeless and Universal [[Domain Independent]] [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that *cause* people, families, communities, and ecosystems to succeed and flourish in harmony. 

 These [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Patterns of Life]] would be contrasted with their [[Antitheses]], which we could term [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]] - the most Timeless and Universal Domain Independent [[Anti-Wisdom]], [[Anti-Principles]], and [[Anti-Values]] that cause unnecessary pain, suffering, corruption, injustice, and death. 

## Transforming the Human Pattern Language: FROM The Old, TO The New 

Understanding that the [[Root Cause]] of the [[Meta Crisis]] is our way of being and doing as a human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]]...

...and that our Way is something like a [[Pattern Language]]... 

...we understand that the [[Meta Opportunity]] is to transform our [[Way]]...

...[[FROM the Old TO the New]]...

...so that Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom reign, [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

## Transforming Human Thought, Speech, and Behavior 

We understand from centuries of spiritual work, coaching, and mentoring, and from decades of clinical psychology, that if you want to transform human behavior...

...you can't begin by trying to transform human behavior. 

Human behavior flows from a complex substructure, conscious, subconscious and unconscious. It rises primarily from below the level of conscious thought and understanding. This means that it cannot readily be transformed from the exterior. 

However we have also discovered that [[Genuine Transformation of Spirit and Consciousness]] *naturally* leads to the manifestation of entirely New Patterns of thought, speech, and action, and that even highly intractable patterns of negative conduct can suddenly pass away. 

We further have come to understand that the deep human desire for belonging can drive people to cling to, or shift, Patterns of Speech and Behavior in response to Cultural [[Norms]] and [[Values]]. 

This leads to an understanding of a three part basic process: 

1. [[Genuine Transformation of Spirit and Consciousness]]  
2. [[Progressive Articulation]] of the [[New Norms and Values]]  
3. Co-Creation of the [[Path]], infrastructure, and bridges that pave the Way for the Common Transformative Journey - [[FROM the Old TO the New]]  

## No One Involuntarily Left Behind 

From the standpoint of Creator's Intent and Love, the desire is for no one to perish, suffer, or be involuntarily left behind. 

From the standpoint of an interexistent crisis of crises / [[Meta Crisis]], we understand that only a widespread, *nearly universal* shift in our Way of being can prevent [[Collapse]]. 

From the standpoint of the Living System, we understand that the Energetics, Air, Water, and Microbiome are all interconnected and globally flowing, such that what we do to the energy, air, water, soil and microbiome in any area, we do to the Manifest Spirit of the Creator and All Creation. 

## A Universal Movement

And so we end up with the grand challenge: 

*How do we **Move** the **Whole Population***?

[[FROM]] the degenerative omnicidal patterns of failure and death that define and are destroying the [[Old World]]... 

[[TO]] the regenerative patterns of success and life that define the [[New World]] we are being invited to continually Co-Create in partnership with the Creator and All Creation? 

The highest desire for everyone to find their [[Way]] to the [[New World]], with no one [[Involuntarily Left Behind]]. 

## A Tipping Point Strategy Led By Transforming Consciousness and Cultural Norms

The core of the Lionsberg Strategy is therefore a tipping point strategy, led by the [[Genuine Transformation of Spirit and Consciousness]] and the fractal adoption of the [[New Norms and Values]], leading to the ongoing regeneration and Co-Creation of the [[New World]]. 

The first part involves Co-Creating the [[Environment]], [[Conditions]], Infrastructure and [[Experience]] to enable the transformation of Consciousness, the embodiment of the [[New Norms and Values]], and the co-creation of the [[New]]. 

This was the purpose of [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]].  

The second part involves awakening and uniting humanity for the opportunity and adventure of the lifetime - the Epic Quest to depart from [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]], progress through [[The Wilderness]] that always separates the [[Old]] form the [[New]], and Co-Create the [[New World]] / [[The Promised Land]]. 

This involves reimagining, redesigning, rebuilding, and continuously improving the [[New Norms and Values]] - the [[New Pattern Language]] - we are Progressing Towards. 

This second phase composes the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] that began Spring 2024, during which [[10 Billion People In 10 Years]] will be invited to progress [[FROM the Old TO the New]], and take up their [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New World]] we are co-creating in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]].  

## Pathways, Bridges, and Infrastructure 

Recognizing that billions of Citizens are going to need to undertake [[The Quest]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]], the need to invest heavily in the Pathways, Bridges, and Infrastructure that mark the Way becomes self-evident. 

The heart of Love desires to make it as easy as possible for every family and tribe to make the journey. 

## The Story - The Quest Towards The Goal of Greatest Worth 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that 1) Consciousness lays fundamentally lays itself out according to a [[Narrative Framework]], and 2) A Story is the only vessel capable of holding something with the sheer scope and complexity of what we are contemplating, in a Way that can be eternally passed on through subsequent generations. 

The concept of archetypical stories that both fit and shape human consciousness is deeply rooted in the study of mythology, psychology, and literature. These stories, often referred to as archetypes, are patterns or motifs that recur across cultures and time periods, reflecting universal elements of the human experience. They resonate because they reflect fundamental aspects of the human journey, our struggles, dreams, fears, and desires. 

Some of the most prominent archetypical stories that have been identified include:

1. **The Hero's Journey**: Perhaps the most well-known archetype, this pattern describes a cycle where a hero ventures out from the ordinary world into an Unknown region of supernatural wonder, encounters fabulous forces, wins a decisive victory, and then returns from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on their fellow man. This journey can be seen in stories ranging from ancient myths like Gilgamesh, to modern tales such as "The Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars."
    
2. **The Quest**: This archetype involves a search for something valuable, whether it be a tangible object, knowledge, or personal transformation. The quest narrative drives the protagonist and often a group of companions through a series of challenges and adventures towards a significant goal or destination.
    
3. **The Transformation or Metamorphosis**: This theme revolves around the profound change or transformation of the main character(s), often involving a descent into darkness or chaos and emerging renewed or reborn. This can be seen in religious narratives like the death and resurrection of Christ, or literary works like Kafka’s "The Metamorphosis."
    
4. **The Initiation**: This archetype represents a coming-of-age story where the protagonist undergoes trials or a series of tests to transition from one phase of life to another, often from adolescence into adulthood. This can include physical, mental, or spiritual challenges.
    
5. **The Fall**: This narrative archetype involves a descent from a higher to a lower state of being, characterized by the loss of innocence, grace, or status. It often explores themes of temptation, sin, and the potential for redemption.
    
6. **The Battle Between Good and Evil**: This universal theme portrays the conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, often with the fate of the world in balance. It is a reflection of the moral and ethical struggles within human nature and society.

The Lionsberg Strategy embraces this understanding by contextualizing [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] within an archetypical [[Narrative Universe]] designed to unfold as a [[Story of Stories]] as [[The Movement]] progresses. 

## Timing - The 10 Year Grand Strategy

[[We Do Not Know]], however our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that this decade, and perhaps the progress made in the next 24 months, will determine whether we succeed or fail on our quest. The Lionsberg Strategy calls for us to [[Act As If]] that were true. 

The Strategy and Plan designates a series of milestones across time: 

#### All prehistory 

#### -1,000 BC to 1800 AD

#### 1800 to 1900 

#### 1900 to 1960s 

#### 1970s to 2010s 

#### [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] (2017 to 2023) 

### The 10 Year Grand Strategy 

#### The 90 Day Sprint (2024)

#### 3 Years, 3% (2024 to 2026) 

#### [[The 7 Year Window of the Crisis and Opportunity]] 

#### The Trailing Three Year Reorientation, Regeneration, and Relearning  

#### The 20 Year Generational Contingency 

#### The New Millennium and Beyond 

## Work Breakdown Structure - The 12 Pillars

[[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] involves [[Co-Creating The New]]. We must co-create and continuously improve [[The Promised Land]].  

We start with the [[Overarching and Uniting]] notion of [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. 

We then begin to build out our [[Plans and Specifications]] for the [[New World]] we are Co-Creating. 

This necessitates identifying the primary [[Features of Work]] via a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. 

The first level of the Lionsberg Work Breakdown Structure is [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]. 

![[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]

Around each of The 12 Pillars, [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]] are designed to be formed, which in turn connect and empower a distributed array of millions of [[Teams]] that compose the [[Team of Teams]].  

The [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]], and the decentralized array of small [[Teams]] they empower, are connected and empowered themselves by the core elements of the Lionsberg System and Commons, that address the [[General Issues]] that each of them, and all the [[Teams]] they support, face. 

## This Much Work Requires a System

### We Have Work To Do

Awakening, inspiring, uniting, and moving [[All Humanity]] FROM the [[Old]], to the [[New]] we are co-creating, in a single generation, is a lot of work. 

It represents the greatest joint venture in human history, requiring  trillions of dollars and hours of coordinated flow across the entire human species. 
### This Much Work Requires a Purpose-Built System 

Even the simple work we have learned to do our past, like co-creating bridges, roadways, and cathedrals, requires a basic System of Work. 

An unprecedented [[Meta Project]] will required an unprecedented System and Approach, purpose-built to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 
### The System of Systems

In this case, what is called forth is an entire System of Systems; in effect, a [[New Human Operating System]]. 

The [[New Human Operating System]] must be composed of interoperable sub-systems that address each of [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]], while integrating itself within the interoperable super-systems of Nature that compose the [[Living System]] we are part of. 
### The System Must Be Unified by The Goal 

The entire [[System of Systems]] must be integrated and cohered into [[Highest Order Functional Unity]] by [[The Goal]] of the [[One]] that unites us [[All]]. 

For the first time in history, this will enable us to measure progress and allocate resources collectively towards the [[Critical Path]] / [[Critical Chain]]. 

### The System Must Be Conceptually Universal and Eternal, and Fractally Implementable  

The [[New Human Operating System]] must also be conceptually universal and eternal, while also fractally localizable and implementable, so that it can be localized, adapted, and instantiated poly-centrically, across all [[Levels of Analysis]] both within our current planet, and beyond it. 

- Individual  
- Family  
- Team  
- Organization  
- Federation  
- Community  
- Watershed  
- Tribe  
- Bioregion  
- Region  
- Planet  
- Star System  
- Interstellar System  
- etc. etc. 

For those who have not thought beyond the limits of their locality or planet, the idea of a operating system designed and built to co-operate across millions of years and countless planets and star systems may seem far fetched or incredible. However it is suicidal not to think of the long term - we know that this star system will become uninhabitable in just a few short galactic years (a galactic year is 230,000,000 years, the amount of time it takes the sun to orbit the Black Hole at the center of the Milky Way). Beyond that known naturally end point, numerous [[Existential Threats]] could conceivably set back the experiment of Life and Consciousness aboard Earth by millions, hundreds of millions, or billions of years (degeneration, nuclear war, AI, asteroids, pandemics, etc.). 

Because the [[Creator's Intent]] is Omniconsiderate, Universal, and Eternal, so too must our thinking become about how to Progressively Realize The Goal. 
### Waste, Value, and Throughput of The Goal 

The co-creation of a conceptually unified System purpose-built to [[Progressively Realize]] the [[The Goal]] ([[Creator's Intent]] / [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]), enables us to technically redefine our understanding of [[Waste]] and [[Value]] relative to [[The Goal]] we are co-operating in pursuit of. 

Coupled with our [[New]] [[Time-Energy Accounting]], this will reveal that the vast majority of meaningless and dangerous work humanity is doing to "earn a living" by exploiting One Another and All Creation is actually [[Waste]] - and that we would be collectively be far better off to pay them to *stop creating waste*, while we reorganize our Selves and learn to co-operate the [[New Human Operating System]].  

These ideas, collectively composed of (what lies beyond) "lean", "agile", "theory of constraints", "the goal", "critical chain", etc., have exposed 60% plus waste in nearly every domain they have touched. We anticipate that the level of [[Waste]] on [[Worksite Earth]] in the 2020s is closer to 80%+.  
### Multi-Generational Co-Operation

The [[New Human Operating System]] we are co-creating and learning to co-operate (which I call the [[Lionsberg System]]), does not just exist for us. 

It exists in service to all past, current, and future generations of Life and Consciousness, in All Times and Spaces. 

This requires that we view all life and consciousness as interexistent aspects of [[One Body]] developing through the millennia, and that as we meet needs, solve problems, accomplish goals, and co-create the [[New]], we are continually honoring the Wisdom and contributions of our elders and ancestors, while [[Passing The Flame]] to the rising generations. 

Through this lens, we come to understand that the knowledge, technologies and techniques we employ in any given generation are built to be superseded and pass away, and that what remains is the Spirit, Intention, Wisdom, Culture, and Values, whose continuous improvement is our main act of co-creation. 
## A System Requires a Structure 

Such a universally and eternally conceptualized System and Approach must Incarnate itself in [[SpaceTime]], and develop by grappling with the Realities at hand in its Embodied Time and Space. 

The act of Incarnation requires a concrete and pragmatic structure to house and protect its emergence. 

For this reason, the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]], [[Provisional Backbone]], and [[Provisional Mind]] were co-created during [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] to enable the [[Many Diverse Parts]] of [[The Body]] to begin connecting and co-operating with one another. 
## A System and a Structure Require a Selectively Permeable Membrane 

Any living organism (which an emerging body of co-creators is), requires a [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]], which protects the finite System and Structure within from the infinite Universe of things without. 
## A Selectively Permeable Membrane Requires an Immigration Policy and Immune System 

Because [[The Body]] developing within the [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]] must incorporate aspects of the surrounding [[Universe]] to grow and flourish, something akin to an [[Immigration Policy]] must be developed that allows New things to be incorporated in an orderly manner on the basis of [[Mutual Consent]]. 

Additionally, an [[Immune System]] is required to deal with pathogenic or toxic agents that will inevitably find their way through the membrane. 

For this reason, the [[Lionsberg System]] must continuously improve its [[Immigration Policy]] alongside the functioning of its [[Immune System]]. 

## A System and Structure with a Selective Permeable Membrane Requires Governance, Culture and Co-Operation 

Any body divided against itself will eventually fail and die. 

Therefore the [[Many Diverse Parts]] of [[The Body]] require a system and way of governance, culture, and co-operation. 

## Governance, Culture and Co-Operation Require Lifelong Learning, Training, and Development 

In the context of a multi-generational body of co-creation that requires ongoing governance, culture, and co-operation, every new member of [[The Body]], whether they enter via the [[Immigration Policy]] or are born into [[The System]], must learn how to co-operate and flourish as part of [[The Body]]. 

Therefore one of the most foundational among [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] is the co-creation and continuous improvement of a system of lifelong learning, training, and development, that every co-creator has equal access to. 

Because our purpose on Earth is to Become the fullness of who we are uniquely created to be by collaborating with the Creator and All Creation to Progressively Realize The Goal, the development of each diverse fractal aspect of Creation towards the fullness of [[Potential]] is paramount. 
## Measuring Throughput of The Goal 

The System is designed to produce Throughput of [[The Goal]]. 

Because the [[Critical Path]] runs through the tipping points strategy rooted in transformation of [[Consciousness]] and [[Pattern Language]]... 

...[[Throughput]] can be measured by (something like) how many Individuals, have progressed how far, on [[The Quest]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. 

The Lionsberg [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] predict that the [[New]] Organism may emerge through reciprocating cycles that can be best modeled along an exponential unfolding such as the [[Fibonacci]] sequence. 

The Lionsberg Cycles of Expansion chart the fibonacci sequence, and relate to how many people have joined The Movement / The Game and are Progressing along the [[Critical Path]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]].

The [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] measures the [[Rate]] at which the [[Lionsberg System]] produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

Whereas the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] measure [[Quantity]], the dimensions of [[Progress]] / [[Throughput]] additionally encompass [[Quality]].  

These two dimensions create the basis for [[Measurement]] and [[Continuous Improvement]].  
## Fractal Instantiation of The System from the Bottom Up

As each Individual crosses through the [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]] and becomes a Co-Creator of The System... 

...they must discover through [[Experiential Learning]] how to instantiate and co-operate [[The System]] for them Selves, for their Family, for their Teams, for their Community, for their Bioregion, etc. 

One of the obvious-in-hindsight learnings from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] is that unenlightened beings cannot co-create enlightened systems. 

Therefore [[The Transformation]] has to occur from the [[Bottom Up]] - starting with the hard work of each individual to look within and begin their own process of healing, development, and transformation. 

As individuals accept [[The Invitation]], connect to [[The Movement]], and share their [[Individual Stories]], they [[Become Visible To The Movement]], they and the movement get to know themselves better, and the process of [[Building Relationships]] accelerates. 

Transforming Individuals can then forge or join [[First Degree Groups]] with others they are inspired by and passionate about collaborating with to transform their lives and their world. 

[[First Degree Groups]] then articulate and share their [[Group Stories]], so that [[The Movement]] can get to know their identity, purpose, passions, and reason for being. 

[[Individual Stories]] and [[Group Stories]] are continuously updated and improved to reflect: 

- [[Who We Are]]  
- [[Where We Are]]  
- [[How We Got Here]]  
- [[Where We Are Going]]  
- [[Why]]  
- Past and Current [[Quarterly Quests]] - Reflected in [[Quest Stories]]  

In general, [[First Degree Groups]] must be and become [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], drawing strength from The Movement / The Body / The System / The Commons to facilitate their emergence, development, and success, while [[Tithing]] back the first 1/10th of their available flow of time, resources, and attention to strengthen [[The Whole]]. 

While the first 1/10th of available [[Flow]] is Tithed to strengthen The Commons and The Whole for all current and future generations, 90% of Time, Energy, Attention, and Resources are focused on local [[Quarterly Quests]] undertaken by [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] Teams. [[Every Quest is a Project]], and [[Quests Are Undertaken By Teams]] (Teams / Groups used here synonymously). 

These three basic units form the basis of how [[The System]] is voluntarily and fractally instantiated from the [[Bottom Up]]: 

1. [[Individuals]]  
2. [[Groups]] / [[Teams]]  
3. [[Quests]] / [[Projects]]  

On the [[Provisional Platform]], you will find these three objects as the basic units of organization and emergence. 
## Milestone: 3% of the Population, ~250 Million Leaders, Organized Into Autonomous Teams, Engaged in Quarterly Quests 

The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan, reflecting the wisdom of indigenous, eastern, and western thought, includes a significant early milestone of connecting and empowering 3% of the human population, roughly 250 million leaders, by 2026. 

Assuming an average [[First Degree Group Size]] of 5 to 7 [[Individuals]], this is nominally 50 million [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams. 

## Distribution 

Assuming we avoid the [[Existential Threats]] at hand and the population grows out towards 10 Billion, we can set some broad breakpoints for understanding the distribution of Teams across the various Domains of [[SpaceTime]]. 

10 Billion People are Distributed Across Roughly: 

- 12 to 24 Georegions 
- 150 to 200 Bioregions  
- 750 to 1,000 Ecoregions  
- 10,000 Communities of 1,000,000 Individuals  
- 100,000 Communities of 100,000 Individuals  
- 1,000,000 Communities of 10,000 Individuals   
- 10,000,000 Communities of 1,000 Individuals  
- 100,000,000 Communities of 100 Individuals  
- 1,000,000,000 Groups of 10 Individuals  

For comparison, some mapping sources have located approximately 4 million discrete towns and cities across the world. 

Accomplishing this milestone would mean that by 2026, 50 Million teams, composed of the most [[Enlightened]] and Ready leaders we can identify, would be distributed as follows: 

- ~2 Million to 4 Million Teams Per Georegion  
- ~270,000 Teams Per Bioregion 
- 500 Teams per Community of 100,000 Citizens 
- 50 Teams per Community of 10,000 Citizens  

If we imagine a given physical place and time, with 10,000 Citizens, we could imagine that group determining, season by season, quarter by quarter, its most important priorities, challenges, needs, and opportunities... 

...and then the 50 trained, equipped, connected and empowered Teams working together to [[Stack Up And Align]] activities across the community to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand via their time bound, measurable, and aligned [[Quarterly Quests]]. 

## Implementation Hubs and Fractal Commonsing 

If we imagine the distributed array of 500 [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams in a given population center of 100,000 Citizens, and that there are *100,000 of these population centers around the world*, we can imagine that each team, and each group of team working to serve and empower the surrounding community with be faced with a common set of needs and opportunities, encompassing things such as: 

- Community / Social Space  
- Meeting Space  
- Office Space  
- Learning Space  
- Wellness and Treatment Space  
- Manufacturing Space (Additive Manufacturing, Forges, etc.)
- Warehousing, Storage, and Distribution Space  
- Mechanical and Repair Space  
- Cold Storage Space (Food, Medicine, etc.)  
- Research and Development  
- Art / Maker / Craftsperson Space  
- Culinary Space  
- Market Space  
- Food Cultivation / Food Forest / Permaculture Space  
- Recreational Space  
- Sporting Space  
- Concert / Conference Space  

Beyond the Spaces required or aspired, there will be common sets of functional needs, such as: 

- Facilitation and Community Engagement Systems and Expertise  
- Regenerative Insurance and Financing Systems and Expertise   
- Learning, Education, and Developmental Systems and Expertise  
- Vocational Training and Development Systems and Expertise  
- Health and Wellness Systems and Expertise  
- Regenerative Agricultural Systems and Expertise  
- Manufacturing Systems and Expertise 
- Administrative Systems and Expertise 
- Accounting and Compliance Systems and Expertise  
- Relationship Development Systems and Expertise  
- Research and Development Systems and Expertise  

Additionally, we can imagine that there will be many significantly beneficial tools and technologies that would aid any community that had them, but may be very difficult for Teams of Communities to afford in isolation. 

We therefore imagine a [[Fractal Commonsing]] approach, where basic necessities like energy production, clean water production, sanitation, major farming and construction tools, additive manufacturing capabilities, learning and wellness tools and facilities, etc. would be housed in locally stewarded [[Commons]] providing equal access to every community of ~100,000 Citizens (or as locally appropriate, wise, right and good). 
## Regional, Bioregional, and Local Instantiation Hubs 

If [[The Goal]] requires that we inspire and move [[10 Billion People In 10 Years]], and that a functional federated system addressing all aspects of society such as the one described in [[The Prophesy of Mondragon]] might serve nominally 100,000 people... 

...[[Success]] requires co-creating something like 100,000 Interlinked [[Local Instantiation Hubs]] over the next 10 years, with each one serving as a [[Commons]] of core services, tools, technologies, and capabilities for the surrounding community / [[Locality]]. 

These ~100,000 interlinked [[Local Hubs]] would connect and support a network of ~1,000,000 Community Hubs, and would be connected to and supported by a network of ~150 to 200 [[Bioregional Hubs]], which in turn would be connected to and supported by a network of 12 to 24 [[Georegional Hubs]].    

Assuming a nominal average cost of $1 Million to $2 Million per Community Hub, this is approximately a $ 1 Trillion to $2 Trillion program of action, less than what humanity spends each year on military and defense expenses alone.

Assuming a nominal average cost of $10 Million to $20 Million per Local Hub, this is approximately a $1 Trillion to $2 Trillion program of action. 

The [[Bioregional Hubs]] would house more major capabilities such as chip / semiconductor manufacturing, spacefaring activities, larger scale energy generation and exchange, etc., and would therefore likely be in the range of $10 to $20 Billion / Bioregional Hub, resulting in an approximately $3 Trillion program of action. 

The [[Georegional Hubs]] would need to ensure full interoperability and freedom of ecosystemic resource flows across all [[Bioregional Hubs]] and [[Local Hubs]], as well as hosting the most advanced technological and manufacturing operations being conducted by the human species. The estimated cost for these hubs is likely to be in the range of $100 Billion to $200 Billion per Georegion, again an approximately $3 Trillion program of action. 

The design and build of the decentralized network of [[Instantiation Hubs]] addressing each of the [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] for every family and community on earth could be accomplished for approximately ~$10 Trillion. 

## Financing The Instantiation Hubs During The 10 Year Grand Strategy 

Assuming humanity is presently spending ~$2.4 Trillion / Year on military and defense spending (likely a significant underestimate), and that military and defense costs would rise at a nominal rate of 5% / year due to inflation and the WWIII that is breaking out, military and defense spending would be approximately as follows: 

- 2024 - $2.4 Trillion  
- 2025 - $2.52 Trillion 
- 2026 - $2.65 Trillion  
- 2027 - $2.78 Trillion 
- 2028 - $2.92 Trillion 
- 2029 - $3.06 Trillion 
- 2030 - $3.22 Trillion 
- 2031 - $3.38 Trillion 
- 2032 - $3.55 Trillion 
- 2033 - $3.72 Trillion 

Total 10 year anticipated military and defense spending (default trajectory)

- *$30.19 Trillion*

To accomplish the $10 to $15 Trillion implementation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[New Human Operating System]], we propose that the Citizens of the world agree to redirect 10% of the resources flowing to military and defense purposes towards the implementation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] starting in 2025, and increasing by 10% each year. 

Revised military and defense resource flows would then be as follows, with a wise, responsible, and balanced redirected of resources occurring in a phased manner, simultaneously around the world. 

- 2024 - $2.4 Trillion (assume budgets already set, political will lacking) 
- 2025 - $2.27 Trillion 
- 2026 - $2.12 Trillion  
- 2027 - $1.94 Trillion 
- 2028 - $1.75 Trillion 
- 2029 - $1.53 Trillion 
- 2030 - $1.29 Trillion 
- 2031 - $1.01 Trillion 
- 2032 - $0.71 Trillion 
- 2033 - $0.37 Trillion 

Total 10 year anticipated military and defense spending ([[New Vision and Plan]])

- *$12.99 Trillion*

This single redirection of funds [[FROM Weaponry TO Livingry]] frees up $17 Trillion to accomplish the $15 Trillion [[New Vision and Plan]], with a 13.3% Contingency. 

This very elementary analysis of how we can afford the [[New Vision and Plan]] illustrates the ridiculous point that for less than 1/2 of what we are currently on track to spend to wage WWIII and risk destroying 2/3 to 3/4 of the human population, we could beat our swords into tools of life and co-create [[A Future For All That Is Better Than Any Has Enjoyed In The Past]]. 

All it requires is enough people [[Believing It Is Possible]], Joining The Movement, and taking up their equal [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New Covenant]] and [[New World]] we are embodying, enacting, and co-creating. 

## The 7 Year Window, and the 3 Year Lag 

The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] is composed of [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], during which we will invite [[All Humanity]] to [[Join The Movement]]...

...and [[The 3 Year Lag]], which is the approximate amount of time it will take for each of us to heal, learn, reorient, and feel truly connected, empowered, and supported as an equal member and Citizen in the [[New World]]. 

Every Individual who Joins The Movement will be invited to set their feet on a path of healing, growth, development, and co-creation via [[The Lionsberg Experience]]. After approximately 3 years and the successful completion of all orientation and onboarding requirements, and successfully demonstrating their commitment to embodying and enacting the Spirit and Values of the [[New Vision and Plan]], each individual will earn their [[New Citizenship]]. 

The youth of Earth will be invited to begin [[The Lionsberg Experience]] when they turn 15 years old, such that they graduate into their [[New Citizenship]] at 18 years old. 
## Why A Named System? Why Not Merely A Pattern, Coupled With Templates and Tools? 

The last issue I want to address is [[Why Lionsberg?]] Why do we have to have a named system, vs. merely an abstract pattern, coupled with tools and templates that communities around the world could implement? 

In short, the One Thing that makes this possible is Unity. 

Without a single Unifying Vision, System, and Goal, there is no possible way that we can avoid further fragmenting and fracturing our attention and interactions, especially as the systems and structures of the [[Old World]] increasingly shake, and in some cases fail, throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 

An additional issue is the consideration of Time. None of us know how long [[The Window]] to avoid [[Collapse]], [[Chaos]], and [[Tyranny]] will remain open. 

My [[Current Best Understanding]] is that it would take at least 5 years and $50 Million to recreate the [[Starting Point]] we forged through [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]]. Which means that I actually don't think it could be recreated, since [[The Window]] will likely close before that time. 

I have sacrificed all my former wealth and security, and am acting as if I believe everything is at stake, for everyone, and that the only way I can keep my loved ones safe is if we land humanity and our planet towards a safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]].  For the first time in history, it is possible, and everything we could ever need is at hand. 

I beg you to Join Us for the opportunity and adventure of a lifetime. 

## Details 

There of course will need to be a world class messaging and communication platform that reaches out invitationally to every family and tribe, in all 1,000 languages. 

There of course will need to be a world class tour bringing together leading figures of our time to touch the hearts and minds of billions of human beings. 

There of course will need to be the co-creation of the systems and mechanisms to enable hundreds of billions of dollars of flow each quarter to the Teams advancing the Critical Path. 

There of course will need to be strategies around the political systems and election cycles of each of 200 nations on Earth. 

There of course will need to be a new [[Lionsberg Alliance]] forged to succeed NATO, ensure universal security, and oversee the responsible and balanced redirection of military and defense flows. 

There of course will need to be Wisdom Councils and [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]] around each [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] to aggregate the leading solutions, ideas, and technologies, cross-pollinate them, and empower the distributed array of teams and localities. 

There of course will need to be 12,000 Individuals trained in each of 12 Core Functions of The Body just as a starting point to support the emergence of 50 Million connected and empowered Teams. 

There of course will need to be [[Stories of Transformation]] told to inspire, engage, and fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]].  

There of course will need to be film series, documentary series, and historic cultural events produced. 

And we will of course need to start planning [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]] to inaugurate the [[New Era]]. 

Now that we have a New Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan - everything is possible if we simply arise and unite in partnership with the Creator and All Creation. 

Etc. Etc. 

The [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] cover this all in more detail. 

The [[New Pattern Language]] is clear. 

Now, it purely comes down to the successful execution of the $15 Trillion [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

We started the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] March 1st. The [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] are arising and uniting as a Force For Good to meet this moment in history. We need you. The world needs you. 

The Creator is inviting us to become Co-Creators of the [[Best Possible Future]] for All. 

With Love and Respect for All Creation in All Places and Times,
