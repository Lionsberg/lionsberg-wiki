(The sections below are being gradually folded into the emergent table of contents above)
### Waste, Value, and Throughput of The Goal 

The co-creation of a conceptually unified System purpose-built to [[Progressively Realize]] the [[The Goal]] ([[Creator's Intent]] / [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]), enables us to technically redefine our understanding of [[Waste]] and [[Value]] relative to [[The Goal]] we are co-operating in pursuit of. 

Coupled with our [[New]] [[Time-Energy Accounting]], this will reveal that the vast majority of meaningless and dangerous work humanity is doing to "earn a living" by exploiting One Another and All Creation is actually [[Waste]] - and that we would be collectively be far better off to pay them to *stop creating waste*, while we reorganize our Selves and learn to co-operate the [[New Human Operating System]].  

These ideas, collectively composed of (what lies beyond) "lean", "agile", "theory of constraints", "the goal", "critical chain", etc., have exposed 60% plus waste in nearly every domain they have touched. We anticipate that the level of [[Waste]] on [[Worksite Earth]] in the 2020s is closer to 80%+.  
### Multi-Generational Co-Operation

The [[New Human Operating System]] we are co-creating and learning to co-operate (which I call the [[LIONSBERG System]]), does not just exist for us. 

It exists in service to all past, current, and future generations of Life and Consciousness, in All Times and Spaces. 

This requires that we view all life and consciousness as interexistent aspects of [[One Body]] developing through the millennia, and that as we meet needs, solve problems, accomplish goals, and co-create the [[New]], we are continually honoring the Wisdom and contributions of our elders and ancestors, while [[Passing The Flame]] to the rising generations. 

Through this lens, we come to understand that the knowledge, technologies and techniques we employ in any given generation are built to be superseded and pass away, and that what remains is the Spirit, Intention, Wisdom, Culture, and Values, whose continuous improvement is our main act of co-creation. 
## A System Requires a Structure 

Such a universally and eternally conceptualized System and Approach must Incarnate itself in [[SpaceTime]], and develop by grappling with the Realities at hand in its Embodied Time and Space. 

The act of Incarnation requires a concrete and pragmatic structure to house and protect its emergence. 

For this reason, the Lionsberg [[Provisional Structure]], [[Provisional Backbone]], and [[Provisional Mind]] were co-created during [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] to enable the [[Many Diverse Parts]] of [[The Body]] to begin connecting and co-operating with one another. 

## A System of Systems / Structure of Structures 

Further, we understand that the system and structure cannot be a monolith, but rather need to emerge as something like a [[United Yet Optimally Decentralized]] federation of federations / ecosystem of ecosystems / system of systems / structure of structures, etc. 
## A System and a Structure Require a Selectively Permeable Membrane 

Any living organism (which an emerging body of co-creators is), requires a [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]], which protects the finite System and Structure within from the infinite Universe of things without. 
## A Selectively Permeable Membrane Requires an Immigration Policy and Immune System 

Because [[The Body]] developing within the [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]] must incorporate aspects of the surrounding [[Universe]] to grow and flourish, something akin to an [[Immigration Policy]] must be developed that allows New things to be incorporated in an orderly manner on the basis of [[Mutual Consent]]. 

Additionally, an [[Immune System]] is required to deal with pathogenic or toxic agents that will inevitably find their way through the membrane. 

For this reason, the [[LIONSBERG System]] must continuously improve its [[Immigration Policy]] alongside the functioning of its [[Immune System]]. 

## A System and Structure with a Selective Permeable Membrane Requires Governance, Culture and Co-Operation 

Any body divided against itself will eventually fail and die. 

Therefore the [[Many Diverse Parts]] of [[The Body]] require a system and way of governance, culture, and co-operation. 

## Governance, Culture and Co-Operation Require Lifelong Learning, Training, and Development 

In the context of a multi-generational body of co-creation that requires ongoing governance, culture, and co-operation, every new member of [[The Body]], whether they enter via the [[Immigration Policy]] or are born into [[The System]], must learn how to co-operate and flourish as part of [[The Body]]. 

Therefore one of the most foundational among [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] is the co-creation and continuous improvement of a system of lifelong learning, training, and development, that every co-creator has equal access to. 

Because our purpose on Earth is to Become the fullness of who we are uniquely created to be by collaborating with the Creator and All Creation to Progressively Realize The Goal, the development of each diverse fractal aspect of Creation towards the fullness of [[Potential]] is paramount. 
## Measuring Throughput of The Goal 

The System is designed to produce Throughput of [[The Goal]]. 

Because the [[Critical Path]] runs through the tipping points strategy rooted in transformation of [[Consciousness]] and [[Pattern Language]]... 

...[[Throughput]] can be measured by (something like) how many Individuals, have progressed how far, on [[The Quest]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. 

The Lionsberg [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] predict that the [[New]] Organism may emerge through reciprocating cycles that can be best modeled along an exponential unfolding such as the [[Fibonacci]] sequence. 

The Lionsberg Cycles of Expansion chart the fibonacci sequence, and relate to how many people have joined The Movement / The Game and are Progressing along the [[Critical Path]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]].

The [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] measures the [[Rate]] at which the [[LIONSBERG System]] produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

Whereas the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] measure [[Quantity]], the dimensions of [[Progress]] / [[Throughput]] additionally encompass [[Quality]].  

These two dimensions create the basis for [[Measurement]] and [[Continuous Improvement]].  
## Fractal Instantiation of The System from the Bottom Up

As each Individual crosses through the [[Selectively Permeable Membrane]] and becomes a Co-Creator of The System... 

...they must discover through [[Experiential Learning]] how to instantiate and co-operate [[The System]] for them Selves, for their Family, for their Teams, for their Community, for their Bioregion, etc. 

One of the obvious-in-hindsight learnings from [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] is that unenlightened beings cannot co-create enlightened systems. 

Therefore [[The Transformation]] has to occur from the [[Bottom Up]] - starting with the hard work of each individual to look within and begin their own process of healing, development, and transformation. 

As individuals accept [[The Invitation]], connect to [[The Movement]], and share their [[Individual Stories]], they [[Become Visible To The Movement]], they and the movement get to know themselves better, and the process of [[Building Relationships]] accelerates. 

Transforming Individuals can then forge or join [[First Degree Groups]] with others they are inspired by and passionate about collaborating with to transform their lives and their world. 

[[First Degree Groups]] then articulate and share their [[Group Stories]], so that [[The Movement]] can get to know their identity, purpose, passions, and reason for being. 

[[Individual Stories]] and [[Group Stories]] are continuously updated and improved to reflect: 

- [[Who We Are]]  
- [[Where We Are]]  
- [[How We Got Here]]  
- [[Where We Are Going]]  
- [[Why]]  
- Past and Current [[Quarterly Quests]] - Reflected in [[Quest Stories]]  

In general, [[First Degree Groups]] must be and become [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], drawing strength from The Movement / The Body / The System / The Commons to facilitate their emergence, development, and success, while [[Tithing]] back the first 1/10th of their available flow of time, resources, and attention to strengthen [[The Whole]]. 

While the first 1/10th of available [[Flow]] is Tithed to strengthen The Commons and The Whole for all current and future generations, 90% of Time, Energy, Attention, and Resources are focused on local [[Quarterly Quests]] undertaken by [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] Teams. [[Every Quest is a Project]], and [[Quests Are Undertaken By Circles]] (Teams / Groups used here synonymously). 

These three basic units form the basis of how [[The System]] is voluntarily and fractally instantiated from the [[Bottom Up]]: 

1. [[Individuals]]  
2. [[Groups]] / [[Teams]]  
3. [[Quests]] / [[Projects]]  

On the [[Provisional Platform]], you will find these three objects as the basic units of organization and emergence. 
## Milestone: 3% of the Population, ~250 Million Leaders, Organized Into Autonomous Teams, Engaged in Quarterly Quests 

The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan, reflecting the wisdom of indigenous, eastern, and western thought, includes a significant early milestone of connecting and empowering 3% of the human population, roughly 250 million leaders, by 2026. 

Assuming an average [[First Degree Group Size]] of 5 to 7 [[Individuals]], this is nominally 50 million [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams. 

## Distribution 

Assuming we avoid the [[Existential Threats]] at hand and the population grows out towards 10 Billion, we can set some broad breakpoints for understanding the distribution of Teams across the various Domains of [[SpaceTime]]. 

10 Billion People are Distributed Across Roughly: 

- 12 to 24 Georegions 
- 150 to 200 Bioregions  
- 750 to 1,000 Ecoregions  
- 10,000 Communities of 1,000,000 Individuals  
- 100,000 Communities of 100,000 Individuals  
- 1,000,000 Communities of 10,000 Individuals   
- 10,000,000 Communities of 1,000 Individuals  
- 100,000,000 Communities of 100 Individuals  
- 1,000,000,000 Groups of 10 Individuals  

For comparison, some mapping sources have located approximately 4 million discrete towns and cities across the world. 

Accomplishing this milestone would mean that by 2026, 50 Million teams, composed of the most [[Enlightened]] and Ready leaders we can identify, would be distributed as follows: 

- ~50 Million Teams across The Whole  
- ~2 Million to 4 Million Teams Per Georegion  
- ~270,000 Teams Per Bioregion  
- ~50,000 Teams Per Ecoregion   
- ~5,000 Teams Per Major Population Center of 1,000,000 
- ~500 Teams per Locality of 100,000 Citizens 
- ~50 Teams per Community of 10,000 Citizens  
- ~5 Teams per Microlocality of 1,000 Citizens 

If we imagine a given physical place and time, with 10,000 Citizens, we could imagine that group determining, season by season, quarter by quarter, its most important priorities, challenges, needs, and opportunities... 

...and then the 50 trained, equipped, connected and empowered Teams working together to [[Stack Up And Align]] activities across the community to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand via their time bound, measurable, and aligned [[Quarterly Quests]]. 

## Implementation Hubs and Fractal Commonsing 

If we imagine the distributed array of 500 [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams in a given population center of 100,000 Citizens, and that there are *100,000 of these population centers around the world*, we can imagine that each team, and each group of team working to serve and empower the surrounding community with be faced with a common set of needs and opportunities, encompassing things such as: 

- Community / Social Space  
- Meeting Space  
- Office Space  
- Learning Space  
- Wellness and Treatment Space  
- Manufacturing Space (Additive Manufacturing, Forges, etc.)
- Warehousing, Storage, and Distribution Space  
- Mechanical and Repair Space  
- Cold Storage Space (Food, Medicine, etc.)  
- Research and Development  
- Art / Maker / Craftsperson Space  
- Culinary Space  
- Market Space  
- Food Cultivation / Food Forest / Permaculture Space  
- Recreational Space  
- Sporting Space  
- Concert / Conference Space  

Beyond the Spaces required or aspired, there will be common sets of functional needs, such as: 

- Facilitation and Community Engagement Systems and Expertise  
- Livings Systems Data and Analysis Systems and Expertise 
- Regenerative Insurance and Financing Systems and Expertise   
- Learning, Education, and Developmental Systems and Expertise  
- Vocational Training and Development Systems and Expertise  
- Health and Wellness Systems and Expertise  
- Regenerative Agricultural Systems and Expertise  
- Manufacturing Systems and Expertise 
- Administrative Systems and Expertise 
- Accounting and Compliance Systems and Expertise  
- Relationship Development Systems and Expertise  
- Research and Development Systems and Expertise  

Additionally, we can imagine that there will be many significantly beneficial tools and technologies that would aid any community that had them, but may be very difficult for Teams of Communities to afford in isolation. 

We therefore imagine a [[Fractal Commonsing]] approach, where basic necessities like energy production, clean water production, sanitation, major farming and construction tools, additive manufacturing capabilities, learning and wellness tools and facilities, etc. would be housed in locally stewarded [[Commons]] providing equal access to every community of ~100,000 Citizens (or as locally appropriate, wise, right and good). 

## The Lionsberg Commons 

Linking the [[Fractal Commonsing]] approach would be a highest order [[Lionsberg Commons]] (variously called [[The Commons]]), that would aggregate the leading wisdom, knowledge, solutions, technologies, templates, and patterns from each Fractal Georegional / Bioregional / Local / Community Commons. 

[[Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom Sovereignty]], like the System as a Whole, is designed to co-operate and self-organize from the bottom up, so that each Individual, Team, and Locality can [[Consciously Choose]] what resources, information, and knowledge they share, with which other fractal levels of organization and analysis. 

The best solutions would be reconciled and reconfigured into [[The Prototype]], designed and built as an interoperable [[Kit of Parts]]. 

This approach ensures that any Georegion, Bioregion, or Locality that prioritizes, localizes, and adapts any solution from [[The Prototype]] is co-creating a cohesive and ultimately interoperable node of The Network, while gaining access to the continuous improvement and learnings from all Instantiations across The System as a Whole. 
## Regional, Bioregional, and Local Instantiation Hubs 

If [[The Goal]] requires that we inspire and move [[10 Billion People In 10 Years]], and that a functional federated system addressing all aspects of society such as the one described in [[The Prophesy of Mondragon]] might serve nominally 100,000 people... 

...[[Success]] requires co-creating something like 100,000 Interlinked [[Local Instantiation Hubs]] over the next 10 years, with each one serving as a [[Commons]] of core services, tools, technologies, and capabilities for the surrounding community / [[Locality]]. 

These ~100,000 interlinked [[Local Hubs]] would connect and support a network of ~1,000,000 [[Community Hubs]], and would be connected to and supported by a network of ~150 to 200 [[Bioregional Hubs]], which in turn would be connected to and supported by a network of 12 to 24 [[Georegional Hubs]].    

The [[Bioregional Hubs]] would house more major capabilities such as chip / semiconductor manufacturing, spacefaring activities, larger scale energy generation and exchange, etc., and would therefore likely be in the range of $10 to $20 Billion. 

The [[Georegional Hubs]] would need to ensure full interoperability and freedom of ecosystemic resource flows across all [[Bioregional Hubs]] and [[Local Hubs]], as well as hosting the most advanced technological and manufacturing operations being conducted by the human species. The estimated cost for these hubs is likely an order of magnitude higher, in the range of $100 Billion to $200 Billion per Georegion. 

Assuming the nominal budgets per hub below, the design and build of the decentralized network of [[Instantiation Hubs]] addressing each of the [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] for every family and community on earth could be accomplished for approximately ~$10 Trillion to ~$20 Trillion depending on how much existing infrastructure and built environment can be repurposed and incorporated into the network. 

Budgets include the resources to network and interconnect the hubs, and will be continuously refined as [[The Prototype]] is continuously improved. 

- 1 [[Core Hub]] x $500 Billion 
- 12 to 24 [[Georegional Hubs]] x $100 Billion to $200 Billion = $2 Trillion to $4 Trillion  
- 150 to 200 [[Bioregional Hubs]] x $10 Billion to $20 Billion = $2 Trillion to $4 Trillion   
- 750 to 1,000 [[Ecoregional Hubs]] x $1 Billion to $2 Billion = $1 Trillion to $2 Trillion 
- 1,000 [[City Hubs]] x $ 100 Million x $200 Million = $1 Trillion to $2 Trillion 
- 100,000 [[Local Hubs]] x $10 Million to $20 Million = $1 Trillion to $2 Trillion  
- 1,000,000 [[Community Hubs]] x $3 Million = $3 Trillion  
- 2,000,000 [[Micro Hubs]] x $2 Million = $4 Trillion  

## Financing The Instantiation Hubs During The 10 Year Grand Strategy - Swords to Ploughshares 

Assuming humanity is presently spending ~$2.4 Trillion / Year on military and defense spending (likely a significant underestimate), and that military and defense costs would rise at a nominal rate of 5% / year due to inflation and the WWIII that is breaking out, military and defense spending would be approximately as follows: 

- 2024 - $2.4 Trillion  
- 2025 - $2.52 Trillion 
- 2026 - $2.65 Trillion  
- 2027 - $2.78 Trillion 
- 2028 - $2.92 Trillion 
- 2029 - $3.06 Trillion 
- 2030 - $3.22 Trillion 
- 2031 - $3.38 Trillion 
- 2032 - $3.55 Trillion 
- 2033 - $3.72 Trillion 

Total 10 year anticipated military and defense spending (default trajectory)

- *$30.19 Trillion*

To accomplish the $10 to $15 Trillion implementation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] and the [[New Human Operating System]], we propose that the Citizens of the world agree to redirect 10% of the resources flowing to military and defense purposes towards the implementation of the [[New Vision and Plan]] starting in 2025, and increasing by 10% each year. 

Revised military and defense resource flows would then be as follows, with a wise, responsible, and balanced redirected of resources occurring in a phased manner, simultaneously around the world. 

- 2024 - $2.4 Trillion (assume budgets already set, political will lacking) 
- 2025 - $2.27 Trillion - 90% of planned total 
- 2026 - $2.12 Trillion - 80% of planned total  
- 2027 - $1.94 Trillion - 70% of planned total  
- 2028 - $1.75 Trillion - 60% of planned total  
- 2029 - $1.53 Trillion - 50% of planned total  
- 2030 - $1.29 Trillion - 40% of planned total  
- 2031 - $1.01 Trillion - 30% of planned total  
- 2032 - $0.71 Trillion - 20% of planned total 
- 2033 - $0.37 Trillion - 10% of planned total  

Total 10 year anticipated military and defense spending ([[New Vision and Plan]])

- *$12.99 Trillion*

This single redirection of funds [[FROM Weaponry TO Livingry]] frees up $17 Trillion to accomplish the ~$15 Trillion [[New Vision and Plan]], with a 13.3% Contingency. 

Note that this can be accomplished without dismantling the militaries, by simply training and deploying the existing forces and resources to co-create rather than destroy using a decentralized [[Team of Teams]] approach. 

Beyond the military transition, there is already $500 Billion + / year of annual philanthropic flows that can be gradually redirected towards the [[Critical Path]].  

Additionally, there is $100 Billion + present in the Community Foundations network that could be leveraged to build [[Local Hubs]], [[Community Hubs]], and the [[Regenerative Underwriting, Resourcing and Insurance]] mechanisms. 

Beyond this, it appears that currently ~35% to 40% of global GDP is being spent by humanity to outsource "government" to corrupted centralized structures - [IMF Dataset](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/exp@FPP/USA/FRA/JPN/GBR/SWE/ESP/ITA/ZAF/IND), nominally $35 Trillion to $40 Trillion / year (based on ~$100 Trillion / year nominal GDP).

This expenditure is likely 60% to 80% Waste and could / should be reduced to ~10%, ultimately redirecting ~$20 Trillion to $30 Trillion *per year* to the [[Critical Chain]] of the [[New Human Operating System]]. 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] ultimately proposing liberating humanity from centralized authority and coercive taxation, co-operating the backbone and commons of the [[New Human Operating System]] on the basis of a voluntary Tithe (nominally 10% of Flow).

Beyond the ~30% of global GDP being allocated to government waste, there likely exists another 30%+ of global GDP that is being allocated to economic waste (another $30 Trillion / Year), that could also be redirected towards the [[Critical Chain]]. 

It thus becomes apparent that the savings of *a single year of government waste* could finance the co-creation of the decentralized, self-governing, and self-sustaining hubs that enable humanity to flourish and usher in the [[New Era]]. 

Beyond that perhaps absurd realization, we see that we could reallocate 60% to 80% of global GDP, ~*$60 Trillion to $80 Trillion per year*, gradually liberated and reallocated during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

These resources would be gradually reallocated towards the meaningful [[Quarterly Quests]] undertaken by the decentralized [[Team of Teams]] co-operating the [[New Human Operating System]] / [[LIONSBERG System]]. As seen from the [[Lionsberg Resource Runway]] page, these Quests would account for between $500 Billion and $1 Trillion+ *per quarter* by 2026 (2% to 5%) of global GDP (by the time 3% of the population connected and empowered), before exponentially scaling up through the remainder of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] as the rest of the human species is connected and empowered. 

As stated in the [[Lionsberg Resource Runway]] page, It is our assumption that $2 Million to $10 Million in working capital could advance us towards the ~$100 Million in working capital it will take to realize the first $1 Billion in ecosystemic resource flow across the [[LIONSBERG System]], after which it should be essentially self-funding and self-sustaining. 

**Achieving this milestone merely requires more efficiently allocating *less than 1% of existing philanthropic capital flows* that are currently funding [[Waste]].** 

This very elementary analysis of how we can afford the entire $15 Trillion Grand Strategy / [[New Vision and Plan]] illustrates the ridiculous point that for less than 1/2 of what we are currently on track to spend to wage WWIII and risk destroying 2/3 to 3/4 of the human population over the coming years, and for less *a single year of government waste*, we could take back up responsibility and authority over our lives and our world, embody and enact the [[New Covenant]], beat our swords into tools of life, and co-create [[A Future For All That Is Better Than Any Has Enjoyed In The Past]]. 

All it requires is enough people [[Believing It Is Possible]], Joining The Movement, and taking up their equal [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New Covenant]] and [[New World]] we are embodying, enacting, and co-creating. 

## Bioregional, Local, and Neighborhood Vision, Values, Strategy, Planning, and Quests 

Recognizing that the Vision, Values, Strategy, Plans and Implementation for any [[SpatioTemporal Domain]] must arise from within that [[Domain]], we will expand upon the success of previous bioregional and local envisioning and planning processes. 

In the face of the [[Meta Crisis]], we will want to ensure that every Domain (Individual, Family, Neighborhood, Community, Locality, Bioregion, Tribe, etc.) has a [[Vision, Strategy, and Plan]], and that those strategies and plans ultimately interoperate in the event of any full or partial [[Collapse]] of the [[Existing Order]]. 

This [[Local Planning Process]] reciprocates with the [[All In One]] [[System Wide Master Planning Process]]. 

[[Local Plans]] are surfaced and forged in response to [[The Right Questions]], that illuminate the Spirit and Values of a person, group, or place. 

[[Local Plans]] become the basis for the [[Local Quests]] that fuel [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The Process of envisioning, designing, and building the [[Best Possible Future]] in each [[SpatioTemporal Domain]] will require broadly distributed training and guidance. 

As a starting point, we plan to train 15,000 [[Facilitators]] as the start of a [[Train The Trainer]] / [[Each One Teach One]] approach that will begin spreading through [[The First Three Percent]]. 

As [[Local Quests]] are undertaken and begin to succeed, the [[Stories of Transformation]] we tell fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]], and [[Every Story Is A Prophesy]] of [[Ever Greater Things]] to come. 

[[Local Quests]] will be undertaken by [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams, each of which will be faced with a common set of [[General Needs, Issues, and Aspirations]]. In response, [[Guilds]], Services, and Support will emerge in [[The Commons]] to help [[Teams]] meet the needs, solve the issues, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

In each [[Domain]], the approach to Vision, Strategy, and Planning should balance the emergence of [[Consensus]] from the [[Bottom Up]] with the visionary [[Leadership]] required to forge a System Wide Master Plan that encompasses each of the [[Levels of Analysis]]. 

This balance can be approached by identifying, connecting, and empowering [[The First Three Percent]] of the [[Wise Right Leaders]] in any [[Domain]], and training and equipping them to [[Succeed]]. 

We may discover that the [[Neighborhood]] is a good level of analysis to begin with, with local leaders then empowering individuals and families as [[Sub Systems]] and communities and bioregions as [[Super Systems]]. 

## Fractal Self Governance 

 Each [[SpatioTemporal Domain]] is trained on the new system of governance and decision making that families, neighborhoods, communities, bioregions, georegions and Beyond can co-operate indefinitely into the future. 

## Existing Systems of Governance 

In each SpatioTemporal Domain (200 Nation States, 1,000 of sub-states, millions of Counties, Cities, Villages, School Boards, etc.) we forge Vision, Strategy, and Plans of Action around the progressive elevation, alignment, and transformation of the existing systems of governance.

This can be aided by monitoring the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] in each Domain, from [[The First Three Percent]], through 13%, through 70% etc. alongside the [[Local Election Cycles]]. 

Ultimately, as we cross 70% to 80% adoption of the [[New Paradigm]] in a given domain, we gain access to deeper levers such as [[Constitutional Amendments]]. 

## The 7 Year Window, and the 3 Year Lag 

The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] is composed of [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], during which we will invite [[All Humanity]] to [[Join The Movement]]...

...and [[The 3 Year Lag]], which is the approximate amount of time it will take for each of us to heal, learn, reorient, and feel truly connected, empowered, and supported as an equal member and Citizen in the [[New World]]. 

Every Individual who Joins The Movement will be invited to set their feet on a path of healing, growth, development, and co-creation via [[The LIONSBERG Experience]]. After approximately 3 years and the successful completion of all orientation and onboarding requirements, and successfully demonstrating their commitment to embodying and enacting the Spirit and Values of the [[New Vision and Plan]], each individual will earn their [[New Citizenship]]. 

The youth of Earth will be invited to begin [[The LIONSBERG Experience]] when they turn 15 years old, such that they graduate into their [[New Citizenship]] at 18 years old. 

This enables the Orientation and Onboarding into the New Pattern Language to continue indefinitely into the future, ensuring that every child born is fully connected, prepared, and empowered for positive participation, self-governance, and co-creation in the [[New Era]]. 
## Why A Named System? Why Not Merely A Pattern, Coupled With Templates and Tools? 

The last issue to address is [[Why Lionsberg?]] Why do we have to have a named system, vs. merely an abstract pattern, coupled with tools and templates that communities around the world could implement? 

In short, the One Thing that makes this possible is Unity. Without Unity, the Diverse Parts of the Body cannot co-operate and co-create as One. 

Without a single Unifying Vision, System, and Goal, there is no possible way that we can avoid further fragmenting and fracturing our attention and interactions, especially as the systems and structures of the [[Old World]] increasingly shake, and in some cases fail, throughout [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]]. 

An additional issue is the consideration of Time. None of us know how long [[The Window]] to avoid [[Collapse]], [[Chaos]], and [[Tyranny]] will remain open. 

My [[Current Best Understanding]] is that it would take at least 5 years and $50 Million to recreate the [[Starting Point]] we forged through [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]]. Which means that I actually don't think it could be recreated, since [[The Window]] will likely close before that time. 

I have sacrificed all my former wealth and security, and am acting as if I believe everything is at stake, for everyone, and that the only way I can keep my loved ones safe is if we land humanity and our planet towards a safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]].  For the first time in history, it is possible, and everything we could ever need is at hand. 

I invite you to Join Us for the opportunity and adventure of a lifetime.

7. Preliminary Vision Statement for the [[Lionsberg Resource ReCirculation System]]: 

*Imagine a world where every entity, from individual households to sprawling cities, operates as a harmonious cog in a planetary resource intake and allocation system. At its core, this system embodies a holistic approach to resource management, founded on the principle of waste capture and redistribution for collective benefit.*

*In this vision, every home, business, and community is equipped with advanced technology designed to capture and contain waste at its source. This technology seamlessly integrates into the fabric of daily life, ensuring that no resource is squandered or needlessly externalized. From organic matter to recyclable materials, everything is carefully collected and prepared for the next stage of its journey.*

*But the true beauty of this system lies in its interconnectedness. Boundaries dissolve as waste flows effortlessly through a network of processing and reallocation hubs. These hubs, strategically located at bioregional, ecoregional, and local levels, serve as the beating hearts of the circulatory operation. Here, waste is transformed into valuable resources through innovative technologies and sustainable practices.*

*But this is more than just a logistical endeavor; it’s a testament to collective cooperation and shared responsibility. Communities collaborate, pooling their resources and expertise to ensure the smooth operation of the system. Governments, businesses, and citizens alike recognize the interconnectedness of their actions and the profound impact they have on the planet.*

*Through this collaborative effort, a [[New Paradigm]] emerges—one where waste is not an inevitability, but an opportunity for regeneration, renewal, and the co-creation of ever greater Value. As resources are redistributed with care and precision, the health of the planet flourishes, the well-being of all its inhabitants is safeguarded, and our collective [[Real Wealth]] surges.*

8. We leverage our democratic voices to transform and leverage institutions towards the [[New Vision and Plan]]   
9. Recognizing that a true accounting of the damage and destruction inflicted by [[The Giants]] upon humanity and the planet vastly outweighs their worth or potential to repay in a majority of cases, we progressively turn them over to a Receiver(s), cease all harmful operations, place all their [[High Science Technology]] into The Commons, liberate all their captives, and reassign all their economic, technological, scientific, and logistical might towards the regeneration and [[At-One-Ment]] of the world.


## Retrospection, Continuous Learning and Improvement

## Team Flourishing and Flow 

Coming Soon. 
## Community Flourishing and Flow 

Coming Soon


## Closing Thoughts 

We of course might want to sweep the executive branch in the 2024 and 2026 US elections. 

There of course will need to be a new [[Lionsberg Alliance]] forged to succeed NATO, ensure universal strength and security, and oversee the responsible and balanced redirection of military and defense flows [[FROM Weaponry TO Livingry]]. 

There of course will need to be Wisdom Councils and [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]] around each [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]] to aggregate the leading solutions, ideas, and technologies, cross-pollinate them, and empower the distributed array of teams and localities. 

There of course will need to be 12,000 Individuals trained in each of 12 Core Functions of The Body just as a starting point to support the emergence of 50 Million connected and empowered Teams. 

There of course will need to be unprecedented efforts to stop pollutant flows at their sources, clean up the most polluted sites of the world, and transform our landfills and oceanic dumping grounds into sources of energy and raw materials until they are cleansed from the earth. 

There of course will need to be [[Stories of Transformation]] told to inspire, engage, and fuel the [[Resourcing and Engagement Flywheel]].  

There of course will need to be film series, documentary series, and historic cultural events produced. 

And we will of course need to start planning [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]] to inaugurate the [[New Era]]. 

Now that we have a New Vision, System, Strategy, and Plan - everything is possible if we simply arise and unite in partnership with the Creator and All Creation. 

The [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] cover this all in more detail. 

The [[New Pattern Language]] is clear. 

The [[Divine Blueprints]] are revealing themselves.  

Now, it purely comes down to the successful execution of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

We started the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] March 1st. The [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] are arising and uniting as a Force For Good to meet this moment in history. We need you. The world needs you. 

The Creator is inviting us to become Co-Creators of the [[Best Possible Future]] for All. 

With Deep Love and Respect for All Life in All Places and Times, in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]],
