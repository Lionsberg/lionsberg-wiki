# The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan

In the various [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], we have circumambulated the [[New Vision and Plan]] in detail from various angles. 

This presentation aims to approach (the whole) from the lens of a unified strategy and plan to meet this moment in history. 

It is intentionally designed to remain an eternally incomplete [[Work In Progress]], designed to be continuously improved by each individual and locality that joins [[The Quest]]. 

## History and Inception 

In 2017, [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] began discussions with advisors regarding an Omni-Considerate and Omni-Encompassing Vision, Strategy, and Plan to meet this moment in [[The Story]]. 

## Context 

The context was presumed to be a time of [[Meta Crisis]] in the 2020s, where the systems and existing order would shake and reorder in unprecedented ways. 

It was presumed that the existing trajectory was towards [[Collapse]], but that *before* the existing order collapsed, there was a brief period of [[Time]] during which the [[Human System]] could potentially leap forward into a Higher Order State. 

## Scope of Work

The scope of work inherently encompasses the entirety of the human species and [[Worksite Earth]] without exception, and the expansion of the human species beyond Earth into inter-planetary and eventually inter-stellar configurations. 

## Reintegration of the Human System and Living System 

Encompassing [[All]] Creation, the strategy and plan calls for the reintegration of the [[Human System]] *in service of* the eternally regenerative [[Living System]], or Universe, it is a part of. 

This requires that the [[Human System]] *itself* be transformed FROM [[Degenerative]] TO [[Regenerative]]. 

## Designer's Intent, and Creator's Intent

Like any System or Project, Lionsberg is created *in service of* an overarching and uniting intention. 

On any Worksite, this is legally and philosophically the notion of [[Designer's Intent]]. 

For this [[Meta Project]] encompassing [[All Creation]], it is the notion of [[Creator's Intent]]. 

By [[Creator]], we are referring to [[Ultimate Reality]], or what in English we call [[God]]. 

The 

## Patterns of Success, and a Pattern Language of Success

The successful and proper co-operating of the human species in service of eternally regenerative Universe requires a shift in our Way, or Pattern, of Being. 

A Way of being that remains consistent and modulates itself across Time and Space is perhaps best conceptualized as a set of Domain Independent Patterns. 

Sets of Domain Independent Patterns are perhaps most coherently integrated and composed via [[Pattern Language]]. 

In this case, we are searching for the most Timeless and Universal [[Domain Independent]] [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that *cause* people, families, communities, and ecosystems to succeed and flourish in harmony. 

 These [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Patterns of Life]] would be contrasted with their [[Antitheses]], which we could term [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]]. The most Timeless and Universal Domain Independent Anti-Wisdom, Anti-Principles, and Anti-Values that cause unnecessary pain, suffering, corruption, injustice, and death. 

## Transforming the Human Pattern Language: FROM The Old, TO The New 

Understanding that the [[Root Cause]] of the [[Meta Crisis]] is our way of being and doing as a human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]]...

...and that our Way is something like a [[Pattern Language]]... 

...we understand that the [[Meta Opportunity]] is to transform our Way...

...[[FROM the Old TO the New]]...

...so that Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom reign. 

## Transforming Human Thought, Speech, and Behavior 

We understand from centuries of spiritual work, coaching, and mentoring, and from decades of clinical psychology, that if you want to transform human behavior...

...you can't begin by trying to transform human behavior. 

Human behavior flows from a complex substructure, conscious, subconscious and unconscious. It rises primarily from below the level of conscious thought and understanding. This means that it cannot readily be transformed from the exterior. 

However we have also discovered that genuine transformation of Spirit and Consciousness *naturally* leads to the manifestation of entirely new Patterns of thought, speech, and action. 

And that the deep human desire for belonging can drive people to cling to, or shift, Patterns of speech and behavior in response to Cultural [[Norms]]. 

## No One Involuntarily Left Behind 

From the standpoint of Creator's Intent and Love, the desire is for no one to perish, suffer, or be involuntarily left behind. 

From the standpoint of an interexistent crisis of crises, we understand that only a widespread, *nearly universal* shift in our Way of being can prevent [[Collapse]]. 

From the standpoint of the Living System, we understand that the Energetics, Air, Water, and Microbiome are all interconnected and globally flowing, such that what we do to the energy, air, water, soil and microbiome in any area, we do to the Creator and All Creation. 

## A Universal Movement

And so we end up with the grand challenge: 

*How do we **Move** the **Whole Population***?

FROM the patterns of failure and death that define and are destroying the [[Old World]]... 

TO the patterns of success and life that define the [[New World]] we are being invited to continually Co-Create in partnership with the Creator and All Creation? 

We desire for everyone to find their [[Way]] to the [[New World]]. 

## A Tipping Point Strategy Led By Transforming Consciousness and Cultural Norms

The core of the Lionsberg Strategy is a tipping point strategy, led by transforming Consciousness and Cultural Norms. 

The first part involves Co-Creating the [[Environment]], [[Conditions]], and [[Experience]] within which the transformation of Consciousness progressively occurs. 

The second part involves Co-Creating the [[New]] - designing, building, implementing, and continuously improving the the New Norms and Pattern Language we are Progressing Towards. 

## Pathways, Bridges, and Infrastructure 

Recognizing that billions of Citizens are going to need to undertake [[The Quest]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]], the need to invest heavily in the Pathways, Bridges, and Infrastructure that mark the Way becomes self-evident. 

## The Story - The Quest Towards The Goal of Greatest Worth 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that 1) Consciousness lays fundamentally lays itself out according to a [[Narrative Framework]], and 2) A Story is the only vessel capable of holding something with the sheer scope and complexity of what we are contemplating, in a Way that can be eternally passed on through subsequent generations. 

The concept of archetypical stories that both fit and shape human consciousness is deeply rooted in the study of mythology, psychology, and literature. These stories, often referred to as archetypes, are patterns or motifs that recur across cultures and time periods, reflecting universal elements of the human experience. They resonate because they reflect fundamental aspects of the human journey, our struggles, dreams, fears, and desires. 

Some of the most prominent archetypical stories that have been identified include:

1. **The Hero's Journey**: Perhaps the most well-known archetype, this pattern describes a cycle where a hero ventures out from the ordinary world into an Unknown region of supernatural wonder, encounters fabulous forces, wins a decisive victory, and then returns from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on their fellow man. This journey can be seen in stories ranging from ancient myths like Gilgamesh, to modern tales such as "The Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars."
    
2. **The Quest**: This archetype involves a search for something valuable, whether it be a tangible object, knowledge, or personal transformation. The quest narrative drives the protagonist and often a group of companions through a series of challenges and adventures towards a significant goal or destination.
    
3. **The Transformation or Metamorphosis**: This theme revolves around the profound change or transformation of the main character(s), often involving a descent into darkness or chaos and emerging renewed or reborn. This can be seen in religious narratives like the death and resurrection of Christ, or literary works like Kafkaâ€™s "The Metamorphosis."
    
4. **The Initiation**: This archetype represents a coming-of-age story where the protagonist undergoes trials or a series of tests to transition from one phase of life to another, often from adolescence into adulthood. This can include physical, mental, or spiritual challenges.
    
5. **The Fall**: This narrative archetype involves a descent from a higher to a lower state of being, characterized by the loss of innocence, grace, or status. It often explores themes of temptation, sin, and the potential for redemption.
    
6. **The Battle Between Good and Evil**: This universal theme portrays the conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, often with the fate of the world in balance. It is a reflection of the moral and ethical struggles within human nature and society.

The Lionsberg Strategy embraces this understanding by contextualizing [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] within an archetypical [[Narrative Universe]] designed to unfold as a [[Story of Stories]] as [[The Movement]] progresses. 

## Timing - The 10 Year Grand Strategy

[[We Do Not Know]], however our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that this decade, and perhaps the progress made in the next 24 months, will determine whether we succeed or fail on our quest. The Lionsberg Strategy calls for us to [[Act As If]] that were true. 

The Strategy and Plan designates a series of milestones across time: 

#### All prehistory 

#### -1,000 BC to 1800 AD

#### 1800 to 1900 

#### 1900 to 1960s 

#### 1970s to 2010s 

#### [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] (2017 to 2023) 

### The 10 Year Grand Strategy 

#### The 90 Day Sprint (2024)

#### 3 Years, 3% (2024 to 2026) 

#### [[The 7 Year Window of the Crisis and Opportunity]] 

#### The Trailing Three Year Reorientation, Regeneration, and Relearning  

#### The 20 Year Generational Contingency 

#### The New Millennium and Beyond 

## Work Breakdown Structure - The 12 Pillars

Part of [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] involves [[Co-Creating The New]]. 

We start with the [[Overarching and Uniting]] notion of [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. 

We then begin to build out our [[Plans and Specifications]] for the [[New World]] we are Co-Creating. 

This necessitates identifying the primary [[Features of Work]] via a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. 

The first level of the Lionsberg Work Breakdown Structure is [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]. 

![[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]

Around each of The 12 Pillars, [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]] are designed to be formed, which in turn connect and empower a distributed array of millions of [[Teams]] that compose the [[Team of Teams]].  

The [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]], and the decentralized array of small [[Teams]] they empower, are connected and empowered themselves by the core elements of the Lionsberg System and Commons, that address the [[General Issues]] that each of them, and all the [[Teams]] they support, face.

## Measuring Throughput of The Goal 

The System is designed to produce Throughput of [[The Goal]]. 

Because the [[Critical Path]] runs through the tipping points strategy rooted in transformation of [[Consciousness]] and [[Pattern Language]]... 

...[[Throughput]] can be measured by (something like) how many Individuals, have progressed how far, on [[The Quest]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. 

The Lionsberg [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] predict that the [[New]] Organism may emerge through reciprocating cycles that can be best modeled along an exponential unfolding such as the [[Fibonacci]] sequence. 

The Lionsberg Cycles of Expansion chart the fibonacci sequence, and relate to how many people have joined The Movement / The Game and are Progressing along the [[Critical Path]] [[FROM the Old TO the New]].

The [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]] measures the [[Rate]] at which the [[Lionsberg System]] produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

Whereas the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] measure [[Quantity]], the dimensions of [[Progress]] / [[Throughput]] additionally encompass [[Quality]].  

These two dimensions create the basis for [[Measurement]] and [[Continuous Improvement]].
