# 2023 Q2 Plan - Detailed

## 2023 Q1 120 Day Plan January through April (Recap for Context)

- Break the momentum on abstract Meta Project discussions 
- Shift to focus in on the [[Critical Path]] we can control through [[Jordan]] and [[Lionsberg]] 
	- Speak, inspire, and connect up the Force For Good 
	- Focus on Communication rather than coordination among the network - Decentralized and self-organizing action so Jordan and Lionsberg do not become a bottleneck 
	- Jordan focuses on inspiring and finding new people and resources, and bringing them together through the Lionsberg Platform 
	- Two way Request For Guidance navigation system can then begin operating. 
- Free up meeting schedules until we can meaningfully engage next steps 
- **Hypothesis** - a well resourced core team working full time with Jordan is the critical path that makes subsequent steps possible. Secure the runway. 
- **Issue** - People are having difficulty perceiving a coherent strategy and plan. 
- Secure Resources to Establish a Core Team to work with Jordan to serve and empower the network, and continue development of infrastructure, resources, groundswell and support. 
- Publish the [[New Vision and Plan]] - complete April 2023
	- [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]

## 2023 Q2 60 Day Plan 

### Public Broadcasting 

- We have set up a minimum viable broadcasting system via the [[Above the Chaos - WikiCast]]. 
- This WikiCast will generate 
	- Engaging transcripts that will be linked to relevant topics in the wiki 
	- A channel for Jordan to speak and inspire publicly 
	- A chance to "open source" the process of getting the community up to speed on all the various issues and opportunities. 
- Plan: 
	- Jordan to begin lining up guests, and publish first episode by first week of May 
	- Record first 10 episodes by end of Q2 
	- Publish first 8 episodes by end of Q2 
	- Guests scheduled out 6 weeks in advance by end of Q2 
	- 2- 3 Week buffer of episodes in place by end of Q2  

### Public Speaking 

- In addition to hosting the [[Above the Chaos - WikiCast]], we should get Jordan on other podcasts, panels, and relevant stages  
- Plan 
	- Develop a list of High Value Targets 
	- Begin outreach / pipeline 
	- Speak at least 2x in May and 4x in June 
	- By end of June, have a pipeline of approximately 1 external engagement a week 
	- By end of May, develop a core Ted Talk style speech around the problems facing the world, and the [[New Vision and Plan]]

### Social Media Strategy 

- We have set up a basic social media strategy around [[Jordan]] for now, with [[Lionsberg]] to follow. 
- The [[Above the Chaos - WikiCast]] will generate weekly long-form content to distribute, along with shorter clips. 
- This should ensure content for at least 3 to 6 posts a week, with the Ideal being content 6 days a week Sunday - Friday 
- Plan 
	- Starting first week of May, social media posts 6 days a week, primarily centered around Above The Chaos content and interviews 

### Email List Strategy 

- Call to actions will drive traffic to the Lionsberg.org website for signup 
- Ideally target a weekly communication with highlights from the week, links to Podcast and Social Media content, blogs, events, etc.
- Plan 
	- Start email list through Bloomerang - directly tied into non-profit accounting software 
	- Measure weekly newsletter engagement, growth, and response 

### Engagement Funnel 

- We have established a basic understanding of [[Levels of Participation]] in [[The Lionsberg Experience]]. 
- Use broadcast and social media to create initial awareness / attention 
- Drive to website to create engaged [[Observers]]  
- Invite observers to become [[Supporters]] and [[Participants]]  
- Invite [[Participants]] to become [[Members]] 

### The Lionsberg Experience 

- We have built a brand, infrastructure and platform around Lionsberg for the purpose of connecting and empowering the Force For Good  
- We have set up a minimum viable [[Lionsberg Platform]] - see [[Join The Platform]]  
- Starting May 1st, we will begin unfolding [[The Lionsberg Experience]], creating an array of different ways for people of Goodwill to engage with [[Jordan]], the ideas, the platform, and others who respond to [[The Message]]. 
- Connect, Empower, and Enlighten the Force For Good

### The Message / Communications Strategy 

- Jordan has been speaking / writing in a way that may resonate with philosophers and few else. 
- Need to help Jordan shape, clarify, and segment out messaging by audience. 
- Hypothesis is to start a weekly messaging pulse. With each communication, we will hopefully get a little more engagement. 
- With each new round of engagement, gather feedback, and iterate the messaging again for the following week. 
- Jordan and Alec worked on it a bit here [[Jordan and A - 2023.04.21]] 

### A Core Group of Members / Servant Leaders   

- Beyond [[Observers]], [[Supporters]] and [[Participants]] that Lionsberg is serving... 
- [[Jordan]] would like to work with a small, committed group of [[Members]] to rapidly evaluate / iterate / improve / respond / learn to what emerges. 
- Focused assignments and agreements to help ensure that the plan is executed 
- To hold the group together we need [[Agreements]] 
- Agree on: 
	- System for making and keeping [[Agreements]] and [[Commitments]] that advance the [[Critical Path]]  
	- Define meeting time and schedule 
	- Define protocols for honesty and communication around progress / roadblocks / challenges / issues / etc. 
	- Define system for regular check-ins and [[Retrospective]] on each agreement 
		- Monthly, weekly, daily, hourly in times of crisis, as needed, as agreed, flexible through mutual [[Consent]].  
		- "Reporting" replaced by regular check-ins on the [[Agreements]] 
		- Do both parties feel good, are we moving in the right direction, when do we need to check in next, and how 
- Also responsible for taking in information from the field, making sense of it, and communicating back out to the field. 

### Continuously Improving Resourcing  and Support 

- Need to continuously grow / improve the amount of committed capital willing to respond and fund demonstrable [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 
- Plan: 
	- Crowdfunding and member contributions via the engagement pipeline outlined herein 
		- Get donations set up on the Lionsberg website 
		- Get donations set up on the Lionsberg Platform 
	- High Net Worth / Foundation patronage 
	- Each Sovereign responsible for their own resourcing and the resourcing of others. 
		- Jordan will experiment with setting up a personal website and fiscal sponsorship through Lionsberg as a prototype for "fellowships" that liberate individuals to be who they need to be and do what they need to do and fund what they need to fund independent of the brands they engage with. 

### Continuously Improving Citizen Engagement 

- Nee to continuously grow / improve the Quality and Quantity of Citizen Engagement 
- Plan - See above... broadcasting and social media and word of mouth leading to a funnel of [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] over time. 

### Supporting Leaders and Initiatives 

- There are a group of leaders and initiatives (Mark, Penelope, Ben, Tim, Atossa, Jordan, Pete, Jason, Vincent, Geo, Elliot, Olivier, Ava, Kenya etc. etc. who may want to leverage the platform for fiscal sponsorship, citizen assemblies, citizen groups, crowd funding, impact projects etc. )
- Continue to develop pathways to support, engage,  connect, serve.  

## Tools For This Quarter 

- Set up simple [[Agreements]] - formal or informal 
- Set up simple ways to track [[Agreements]]  
	- Mirror logic in Asana 
	- Functional Requirements 
	- Non-Functional Requirements 
	- Definition of Done / Acceptance Criteria 
		- To get out of this sprint, have to: 
			- plan and do x
			- test it in y way 
			- with z result 
- Set up simple way to communicate 
	- Hypothesis - CSC hosted Lionsberg instance of Mattermost  
- Set up simple way to do task management 
	- Hypothesis - Asana 
		- Pete - Asana is the right choice for almost everyone 
		- Airtable is even better for some sophisticated users 

## Agreements 

- Structure an initial set of [[Agreements]] that can be evolved and improved later 
- Draft a subscription agreement for people who may want to be a part of the unfolding (if required, or just evolve successors to the Manifesto Response Form)
