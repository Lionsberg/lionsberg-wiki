# 13. Designer's Intent and Creator's Intent

Like any System or Project, Lionsberg is created *in service of* an Overarching and Uniting Purpose, Intention, Vision, and Goal. 

On any Worksite, this Uniting Intention is legally and philosophically the notion of [[Designer's Intent]]. 

For this [[Meta Project]] encompassing [[All Creation]], it is the notion of [[Creator's Intent]]. 

By [[Creator]], we are referring to [[Ultimate Reality]], or what in English we often call [[God]]; the Generative Source and Sustainer of the [[Universe]] / [[Living System]] we are a part of.
