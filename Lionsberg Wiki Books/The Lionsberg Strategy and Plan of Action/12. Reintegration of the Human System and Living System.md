# 12. Reintegration of the Human System and Living System

Encompassing [[All]] Creation, the strategy and plan calls for the comprehensive reintegration of the [[Human Species]] and [[Human System]] *in service of* the eternally regenerative [[Living System]], or Universe, it is a part of, and the [[One]] Source and Sustainer of All. 

This requires that the [[Human Species]] and [[Human System]] *itself* be transformed FROM [[Degenerative]] TO [[Regenerative]], empowered by the [[New Human Operating System]]. 

The [[Lionsberg System]] was created to serve this purpose and is freely offered if it of service.
