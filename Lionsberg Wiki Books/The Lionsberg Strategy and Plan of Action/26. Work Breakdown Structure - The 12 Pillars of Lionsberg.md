# 26. Work Breakdown Structure - The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg

[[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] requires [[Co-Creating The New]]. We must co-create and continuously improve [[The Promised Land]].  

We start with the [[Overarching and Uniting]] notion of [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. 

We then begin to build out our [[Plans and Specifications]] for the [[New World]] we are Co-Creating. Progressively articulating the [[Divine Blueprints]].  

Shifting towards action requires identifying the primary [[Features of Work]] via a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. 

The first level of the Lionsberg Work Breakdown Structure is [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]. 

![[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]]

Around each of The 12 Pillars, [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]] can be formed, which in turn connect and empower a distributed array of millions of [[Teams]] that compose the [[Team of Teams]]. 

The [[Citizen Led Joint Ventures]], and the [[Optimally Decentralized]] [[Team of Teams]] they empower, are themselves connected and empowered by the core elements of the Lionsberg System and Commons, that address the [[General Issues]] that each of them, and all the [[Teams]] they support, face. 

The [[Work Breakdown Structure]], coupled with the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] and [[System Wide Master Planning Process]], enable the [[Team of Teams]] to [[Stack Up And Align]] measurable projects and quests to produce [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]].
