# 5. Our Overarching and Uniting Aim and Goal


Rooted in the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] of [[ONE]] for [[All]], the Overarching and Uniting Aim and Goal of the New Vision, Strategy, and Plan is the total integrated wellbeing, development, and right relationship of [[All]] generations of life and consciousness. 

This uniting [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]] and Beyond fulfills the same role that the [[Designer's Intent]] legally, technically, and philosophically plays on any worksite. 

As the [[Old]] systems and structures fail, the Aim is move the entire population out of [[The Caves]] separating and imprisoning us, through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Promised Land]] within a single generation, with no one [[Involuntarily Left Behind]]. 

The End result is a [[New World]] in which every one of its inhabitants can enjoy a higher [[Standard Of Living]] and [[Quality of Life]] than any has enjoyed in the past. 

The most amazing aspect of the eternal [[Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] is that it continues to get [[A Little Better Every Day]] as All Creation works together in harmony to cause it to be so.
