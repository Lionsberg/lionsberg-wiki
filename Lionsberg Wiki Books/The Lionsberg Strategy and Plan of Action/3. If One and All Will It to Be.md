# 3. If One and All Will It to Be

Any such plan to regenerate the world, refound civilization, and co-create a flourishing and abundant [[New Era]] within a single generation can only occur if [[One]] and [[All]] will and intend for it to be,  co-create the miracles along the Way, and cause it to be so. 

As it has been said, *if God wills, we will live, and also (succeed in our plans).*
