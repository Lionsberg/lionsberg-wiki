# 10. Planetary Context

At Inception, the context was presumed to be a time of [[Meta Crisis]] in the 2020s, where the systems and [[Existing Order]] would shake and reorder in unprecedented ways. 

It was presumed that the [[Default Trajectory]] was towards [[Collapse]] and [[Chaos]], but that *before* the existing order collapsed, there was a brief period of [[Time]] during which the [[Human System]] and [[Living System]] could potentially leap forward together into some kind of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] that would enable it to meet the needs, solve the problems, and accomplish the goals at hand. 

It was further assumed that the Corrupt and [[Willfully Blind]] [[Old Leaders]], [[Old Institutions]], and [[Old System]] would be unable or unwilling to competently respond in [[Time]], and that something [[New]] was required to connect and empower [[Us, The People]] to think, move, and respond together.
