# 4. Our Highest Duty to One, All, Wisdom, and Truth

This New Vision, Strategy, and Plan is submitted as a humble offering in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]]. As illuminated in [[The Story of the Builder]], we Know that it contains gaps, insufficiencies, and errors which will need to be remediated by unique gifts, talents, and experiences of those who join togethers as [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]]. 

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[Every Defect Is A Gift]]. It would be a great relief if you could find and remedy as many errors and insufficiencies as possible. [[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]], eventually the [[Dross]] will be burned off and only that which approaches [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]] in the eyes of [[ONE]] and [[All]] will remain. 

Our Collective Mission is to [[Progressively Realize]] the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]] and usher in the [[New Era]], understanding that we, our planet, and our growing federation will always be a [[Work In Progress]]. 

We are here in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]], and committed to [[Navigate]] towards [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]], no matter where they lead.
