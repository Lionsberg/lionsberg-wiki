# 2024 Q4 Update

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] included in 2023 and 2024 a hopeful exploration of whether key aspects of the [[Existing Order]], particularly the [[American Experiment]], could be salvaged. With the democratic super cycle of 2024 in the rear view mirror, We know that it cannot. The Post World War II Order has now failed. The symptoms of its demise will become visible and tangible at an accelerating rate throughout the remaining course of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

As expressed over the last couple years, this does not delay the [[Critical Path]], and in many ways will both enable and force Us to accelerate [[Progress]]. 

The [[Critical Path]] now runs entirely through the [[Tipping Point Strategy]] to transcend the [[Existing Order]] before it collapses into [[Chaos]] and [[Tyranny]] by moving the entire human population [[FROM the Old TO the New]] during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

Due to the [[Critically Effective Time Limit]], the mid-term milestone remains connecting and empowering [[The First Three Percent]] by 2026. We have 24 months remaining. 

Regarding [[World War IV]]: Because the window to take control the of the United States and NATO military and logistical capabilities directly has passed, an indirect approach is required. This was anticipated and follows the same logic of all other domains: a tipping point strategy to identify, connect, and empower [[The First Three Percent]] in each nation and domain. At the right moment, [[The First Three Percent]] in the domains of military, security, and local police will coordinate a break with corrupted nation-state forces commanding them to war and suppress, and collectively turn their tools, technologies, and weapons towards co-creating [[The New]]. 

At the end of 2024, We were approximately 30 to 50 days ahead of schedule on the [[Critical Path]].
