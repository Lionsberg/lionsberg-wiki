# 14. Patterns of Success, and a Pattern Language of Success

The successful and proper co-operating of the human species aboard [[Worksite Earth]] in service of eternally regenerative Universe requires a shift in our Way, or Pattern, of Being. 

A shift in [[The Way We Do Things Around Here]] as a [[Human Species]] aboard Earth. 

A [[Way of Being]] that remains consistent and modulates itself across [[Space and Time]] is perhaps best conceptualized as a set of [[Domain Independent]] Patterns, unified by a [[Central Animating Spirit]]. 

Sets of [[Domain Independent Patterns]] are most coherently integrated and composed via a [[Pattern Language]]. 

In this case, we are searching for the most Timeless and Universal [[Domain Independent]] [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that *cause* people, families, communities, and ecosystems to succeed and flourish in harmony across the [[Largest Conceivable Expanse of Time and Space]]. 

 These [[Patterns of Success]] / [[Patterns of Life]] would be contrasted with their [[Antitheses]], which we could term [[Patterns of Failure]] / [[Patterns of Death]] - the most Timeless and Universal Domain Independent [[Anti-Wisdom]], [[Anti-Principles]], and [[Anti-Values]] that cause unnecessary pain, suffering, corruption, injustice, and death.
