# 22. The Story - The Quest Towards The Goal of Greatest Worth

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that 1) Consciousness lays fundamentally lays itself out according to a [[Narrative Framework]], and 2) [[Story]] is the only vessel capable of holding something with the sheer scope and complexity of what we are contemplating, in a [[Way]] that can be eternally passed on through subsequent generations and understood across [[Levels of Consciousness]]. 

The concept of [[Archetypical Stories]] that both fit and shape human consciousness is deeply rooted in the study of mythology, psychology, and literature. These [[Archetypical Stories]] are patterns or motifs that recur across cultures and time periods, reflecting universal elements of [[The Human Experience]]. They [[Resonate]] because they reflect fundamental aspects of [[The Common Journey]], our struggles, dreams, fears, and desires. 

Ultimately, across cultures, time, and space, the most Archetypical Stories become the most Sacred because they are the most universally Wise and True. They can be gathered up, reconciled, and interwoven like threads into the [[Archetypical Narrative Structure]]. 

Some of the most prominent archetypical story structures that have been identified include:

1. **The Hero's Journey**: Perhaps the most well-known archetype, this pattern describes a cycle where a hero ventures out from the ordinary world into an Unknown region of supernatural wonder, encounters fabulous forces, wins a decisive victory, and then returns from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on their fellow man. This journey can be seen in stories ranging from ancient myths like Gilgamesh, to modern tales such as "The Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars."
    
2. **The Quest**: This archetype involves a search for something valuable, whether it be a tangible object, knowledge, or personal transformation. The quest narrative drives the protagonist and often a group of companions through a series of challenges and adventures towards a significant goal or destination.
    
3. **The Transformation or Metamorphosis**: This theme revolves around the profound change or transformation of the main character(s), often involving a descent into darkness or chaos and emerging renewed or reborn. This can be seen in religious narratives like the death and resurrection of Christ, or literary works like Kafkaâ€™s "The Metamorphosis."
    
4. **The Initiation**: This archetype represents a coming-of-age story where the protagonist undergoes trials or a series of tests to transition from one phase of life to another, often from adolescence into adulthood. This can include physical, mental, or spiritual challenges.
    
5. **The Fall**: This narrative archetype involves a descent from a higher to a lower state of being, characterized by the loss of innocence, grace, or status. It often explores themes of temptation, sin, and the potential for redemption.
    
6. **The Battle Between Good and Evil**: This universal theme portrays the conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil, often with the fate of the world in balance. It is a reflection of the moral and ethical struggles within human nature and society.

The Lionsberg Strategy embraces this understanding by contextualizing [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] within an archetypical [[Narrative Universe]] designed to unfold as a [[Story of Stories]] as [[The Movement]] progresses.
