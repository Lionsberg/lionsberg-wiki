# 8. Timing

We aim to accomplish this transformative refounding  We are targeting a [[10 Year Grand Strategy]], backed by a [[20 Year Generational Contingency]].

Following [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]], we Aim to accomplish [[The Transformation]] as rapidly as possible [[Without Harm or Disadvantage to Any]], nominally during the course of the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] that began March 1, 2024. We have established and are carefully managing a [[20 Year Generational Contingency]] to ensure completion within a single generation. 

Ideally, [[The 90 Day Sprint]] in Q2 2024 will catalyze the first 8 to 10 [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]], uniting the first 55 to 144 [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]] into an [[Optimally Decentralized]] [[Team of Teams]]. 

This will enable the nomination of 5 to 20 respected representatives of [[The Movement]] to assemble by ~July 2024, seeding the [[System Wide Master Planning Group]] and [[System Wide Master Planning Process]], and emerging with a joint Strategy and Plan for Q3 / Summer that advances the [[Critical Path]] and all relevant aspects of [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]]. 

Completing at least another ~5 [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] during Q3 will connect another ~200 to ~1,000 of the Wise Right [[Lionsberg Co-Creators]], leading to the opportunity for the first larger summit / [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] meeting in September / October. 

At the first [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] representatives from [[The Movement]] will refine and collectively ratify the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] and [[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]]. 

The [[New Vision and Plan]] will be broadly broadcast by October 2024 at planetary scale to present humanity with a viable alternative ahead of the November 2024 US elections, ideally leading to a wave of aligned mayors, governors, and an independent presidential candidate from [[The Movement]] being swept into office, with independent [[Citizen Led]] oversight and auditing of an electoral system both parties have repeatedly stated is (at least) corruptible. 

While seemingly audacious / incredible on the surface, accelerating towards this early milestone is crucial to ensure that [[The Movement]] is empowered with the executive authority forthrightly pull NATO / Russia / Ukraine / China / Israel / Iran / North Korea et al back from the potentially Omnicidal [[World War III]] that already is spilling over into Reality, and implement the [[Progressive Disarmament]] and transformation of our High Science Technology [[FROM Weaponry TO Livingry]] during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

The [[Lionsberg General Assembly]] will reconvene in January 2025 after the inauguration, now armed with the essentially unlimited resources required to ensure the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] is completed [[On Time, On Quality, and Under Budget]]. 

This rapid start-up plan ultimately enables the reallocation of $15 Trillion to $20 Trillion of planned military and defense spending towards co-creating flourishing and abundant life and responding to emergent disasters in service of [[One]] and [[All]], as a positive alternative to the omnicidal [[Collapse]] of the [[Existing Order]] in [[Chaos]] and [[War]].   

From there, [[The Milestones]] mark the [[Way]] through the coming millennia and towards [[The Goal]]. 

After [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]] in ~2034, we will be prepared to [[Pass The Flame]] to the rising generations and expand our species beyond the [[SpatioTemporal]] limits of [[Worksite Earth]] towards [[Interexistence]] as an [[Interstellar]] species prior to this Solar System becoming uninhabitable. 

In terms of [[Time]] and [[Space]], we are being challenged to simultaneously discern, think, speak, plan, and act across the [[Largest Conceivable Expanse of Time and Space]], while becoming exceptionally skilled at forging Teams and succeeding in specific, measurable, Time and Space bound [[Quarterly Quests]] that advance the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]]. Right here in our current [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]].
