# 20. A Tipping Point Strategy Led By Transforming Consciousness and Cultural Norms

The core of the Lionsberg Strategy is therefore a movement-based [[Tipping Point Strategy]], led by the [[Genuine Transformation of Spirit and Consciousness]] and the fractal adoption of the [[New Norms and Values]], leading to the ongoing Co-Creation of an eternally regenerative [[New World]] / [[New Paradigm]]. 

[[The Creator Is Inviting Us To Become Co-Creators of The Best Possible Future For All]]. 

Pragmatically, this involves first Co-Creating the [[Environment]], [[Conditions]], Infrastructure, Technology, and [[Experience]] to enable the Transformation of Consciousness, naturally leading to the spontaneous embodiment of the [[New Norms and Values]], and the eternally ongoing Co-Creation of the [[New]]. 

Because Consciousness lays itself out via [[Narrative Structure]], it also requires to Co-Creation of [[New Story]] big enough to encompass and unite us [[All]]. 

These activities were the primary purpose of [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]].  

The second part involves [[Awakening, Inviting, and Uniting]] humanity for the [[Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]] - the Epic Quest to depart from [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]], progress through [[The Wilderness]] that always separates the [[Old]] form the [[New]], and Co-Create the [[New World]] / [[The Promised Land]]. 

This involves reimagining, redesigning, rebuilding, and continuously improving the [[New Norms and Values]] - the [[New Pattern Language]] - we are Progressing Towards, while gracefully [[Allowing The Old Paradigm to Die so that We Do Not Have To]].  

This second phase composes the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] that began Spring 2024, during which [[10 Billion People In 10 Years]] will be invited to progress [[FROM the Old TO the New]], and take up their [[New Citizenship]] in the [[New World]] we are co-creating in partnership with [[ONE]] and [[All]].
