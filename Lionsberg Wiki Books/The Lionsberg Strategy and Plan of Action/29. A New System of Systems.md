# 29. A New System of Systems

In this case of [[Omniconsiderate]] planetary regeneration, what is called forth is an entire System of Systems; in effect, a [[New Human Operating System]]. 

The [[New Human Operating System]] must be composed of interoperable sub-systems that address each of [[The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg]], while integrating itself within the interoperable super-systems of Nature that compose the [[Living System]] we are part of. 

A [[New Human Operating System]], reintegrated and recohered in service of [[ONE]] and [[All]].
