# 1. Introduction to the Lionsberg Strategy and Plan

In the various [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]], we have circumambulated the [[New Vision and Plan]] from various angles in more detail. 

This shorter presentation aims to approach (the whole) from the lens of a unified strategy and plan to meet this moment in history by transforming [[Worksite Earth]] - [[FROM the Old TO the New]] within a single generation. 

It is designed to remain an eternally incomplete [[Work In Progress]] - a living document that is continuously improved as new co-creators join [[The Movement]] and bring their unique [[Puzzle Pieces]] to the banquet table. 

It is an opening Vision to hold the place for the diverse tapestry of [[Future Stories]] that will emerge from millions of groups, teams, and localities around the world, *each with their own localized and adapted Vision, Strategy, and Plan.* The [[System Wide Master Planning Process]] is fractal in nature, co-operated by each [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] individual, group, and locality. 

In fact, if you are reading this, you likely will discover that something is missing, and that you are holding a unique piece of [[The Divine Puzzle]]. Every time new [[Puzzle Pieces]] are discovered that fill in a [[Hole In Our Map]], we are elated. [[Every Defect Is A Gift]]. [[Like Gold Refined Seven Times]], eventually only what is most Wise, Right, True and Good will remain. 

As We guide humanity [[FROM the Old TO the New]], We are engaged in the [[Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime]]. We are venturing out into the [[Unknown]], and learning to co-operate through an eternal dance of emergence and co-creation.
