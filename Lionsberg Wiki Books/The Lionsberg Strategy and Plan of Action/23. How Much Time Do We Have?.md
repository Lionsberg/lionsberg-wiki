# 23. How Much Time Do We Have? 

Only [[ONE]] knows, however our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that this decade, and perhaps the progress made in the next 24 months, will likely determine whether we succeed or fail on our quest. It is also possible that even if we fail, a few may manage survive after passing through the fire of [[Collapse]]. 

Because any system divided against itself cannot remain, from the view [[Beyond The Illusion of SpaceTime]] the [[Existing Order]] has already failed. 

[[The Building Is On Fire]]. [[Collapse]] is a function of [[Time]]. 

Because [[We Do Not Know]] how long we have, we can use [[Probability Based Thinking]] to assess the [[Non-Zero Probability of Systems Collapse]], and every individual and family must decide how long they are willing to remain asleep in [[The Caves]] before awakening, arising, and joining [[The Movement]] towards a safe and flourishing future [[Beyond The Boundary]].  

The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan admits [[We Do Not Know]] how long [[The Window]] to leap into a [[Higher Order State]] will remain open before [[Collapse]] closes it. 

However assessing a high [[Non-Zero Probability of Systems Collapse]], it and calls for us to [[Act As If]] the [[Existing Order]] could [[Collapse]] at any time if we continue to [[Fuel The Fire]] via the degenerative [[Old Pattern Language]], and move as rapidly as possible to set things back in [[Proper Order]] [[Without Harm or Disadvantage to Any]]. 

The Strategy and Plan designates a series of milestones across time: 

#### All prehistory 

#### -1,000 BC to 1800 AD

#### 1800 to 1900 

#### 1900 to 1960s 

#### 1970s to 2010s 

#### [[The 7 Year Window of Preparatory Work and Learning]] (2017 to 2023) 

### The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]   

[[We Do Not Know]], however our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that this decade, and perhaps the progress made in the next 24 months, will determine whether we succeed or fail on our quest. The Lionsberg Strategy calls for us to [[Act As If]] that were true.
