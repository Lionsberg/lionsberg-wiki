# 17. A Universal Movement

And so we end up with [[The Grand Challenge]]: 

*How do we **Move** the **Whole Population***?

[[FROM]] the [[Degenerative]] and [[Omnicidal]] patterns of failure and death that define and are destroying the [[Old World]] and the [[Existing Order]]... 

[[TO]] the [[Regenerative]] and Co-Creative [[Patterns of Success]] and Life that define the [[New World]] we are being invited to continually Co-Create in partnership with the Creator and All Creation? 

How do we forge a [[Way]], [[FROM the Old TO the New]]? 

How do we forge a [[Way]], out of [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]], [[Beyond The Boundary]], through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Promised Land]] whose [[Ideal]] [[Continually Recedes As We Approach It]]?
