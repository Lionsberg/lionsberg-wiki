# 1.2 Sirens and Alarms

When wildfires recently swept through Lahaina, Maui, one of the great tragedies those in power will regret for the rest of their lives is that *no one sounded the alarms*. 

One explanation was that they were afraid that people might panic, and flee out of their homes and into the fire. 

So the sirens stayed silent, and many families and children burned to death, clutching their pets and each other, huddled in a corner in terror. 

My Mission is unashamedly an attempt to ring the alarm bells of society as loudly as I possibly can, wake up as many people as I can, and try to help the Citizens of Earth to safety before it is too late.
