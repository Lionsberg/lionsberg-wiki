# 2.15 Wealth and Opportunity Gap

This causes a growing wealth and opportunity gap between the rich, giant, and politically connected... 

...and the regular folks. 

Because wealth is what we use to educate our children, take risks, and pursue ideas, the growing wealth gap creates a structural opportunity gap between the children of the rich and political, and everyone else.  

This creates a structural and unfair advantage for the children of the rich and political over everyone else, fueling resentment and populism on both the left and the right.
