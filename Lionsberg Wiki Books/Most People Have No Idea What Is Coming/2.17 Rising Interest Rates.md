# 2.17 Rising Interest Rates

Having inflated the monetary supply, the wealth of the rich and The Giants, and the prices of everything, the bankers who control government policy then signal their concerns about the "rising inflation" *that they created* as if it were a foreign force of nature, and begin raising interest rates to make it harder and more expensive for people and corporations to buy things. 

Incidentally, this results in more profits for the bankers, and more suffering for regular folks.
