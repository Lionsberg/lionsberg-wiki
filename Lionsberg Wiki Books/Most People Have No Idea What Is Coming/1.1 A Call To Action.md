# 1.1 A Call To Action

Very few will take the time to read what I have written, or invest the hours, months, and years required to understand the full context, strategy, and plan to confront and overcome the existential threats at hand. I may be slow, but it took me about 25 years of full time thinking to figure it out. 

If you resonate and believe, please take one simple action: 

Go to www.JordanNicholas.org and Join The Movement, and gather all the resources you can into The Commons I have prepared in advance at Lionsberg. Lionsberg has been prepared as an Ark to carry us beyond the collapse of the Existing Order, and towards a Better Future.
