# 1.1 A Call To Action

I wish you would, however I expect very few will take the time to read much of what I have written, or invest the hours, months, and years required to understand the full context, strategy, and plan to confront and overcome the existential threats at hand. 

Therefore, if you believe in me, please take one simple action: 

Go to www.JordanNicholas.org and show you support by Joining The Movement. 

I will do my best to faithfully steward, organize and lead all that I am entrusted with, no matter how small or large. 

From there, I will report to you no less frequently than twice a month, and provide ample opportunities for engagement, training, participation, and next steps as The Movement out of the burning building and towards a brighter future grows.
