# 2.2 Intention

**I am going to try to explain in simple terms why America and the global Order as it presently exists, *cannot stand*, and indeed is already failing.** 

**I am going to try to communicate why I believe that places you and your family in a nearly unimaginable degree of present danger.**

**And I am going to try to communicate a solution of consciously co-creating a better future for *all earth's inhabitants, than any inhabitant has enjoyed in the past.**

**My simple proposed solution is that we work together to co-create the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven, and that we consciously and voluntarily make the the leap FROM the Old TO the New over the next 10 years, with no one involuntarily left behind.**

*It is simple, and because it reflects the eternal and unchanging Will and Intention of God, it is **possible***.
