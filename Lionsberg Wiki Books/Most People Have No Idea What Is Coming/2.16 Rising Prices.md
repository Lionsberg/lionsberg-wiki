# 2.16 Rising Prices

As the government, the rich, and the giants take their fake printed "easy money" out into reality, it becomes easy to spend it and gobble up the supply of things they want - such as property and claims on the houses and future earnings of citizens through debt. 

Because this spending *outpaces new production*, it causes prices to go up, and companies and individuals to use the "easy money", through debt, to acquire things - like properties, cars, stocks, and credit card purchases. 

This is why even though a rational long term evaluator of a market would expect The Markets to drop when an empire breaks the integrity of its money, *The Markets apparently rise*, and with them, prices for everything, when the government prints money. 

But the gains are not Real. It is a trap.
