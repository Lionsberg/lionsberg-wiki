# 2.14 Misallocation of Resources Along Political and Ideological Lines

This flood of fake top down money inevitably results in the misallocation of resources along political and ideological lines, which hinders the ability of citizens to compute and allocate resources on the basis of wisdom and free economics. 

This tilts the economy away from the free market, and towards a centralized command economy with the government and collusive forces determining where and how the money flows, and then print more money to bail out their mistakes. 

Government control of resource allocation tends to result in untold suffering and death for 10s of millions of people.
