# 3.6 Cultural and Social Decay

The progressive perishing that results from deteriorating Spirit, Vision, and Values begins to become visible in the cultural and social fabric of society. 

Deaths from suicide and substance abuse rise. 

In many places it is no longer safe to walk in the streets. 

Theft, violence and crime rise. 

Local economies begin to withdraw, hide, and then collapse. 

Corrupt and politicized systems of "law" and "justice" lose their credibility. 

Homelessness and hopelessness rise. 

Increasingly, people withdraw deeper into themselves and their narrow circles and viewpoints, afraid of "them" "out there".
