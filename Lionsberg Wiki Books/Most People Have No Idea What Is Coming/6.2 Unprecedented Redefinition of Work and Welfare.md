# 6.2 Unprecedented Redefinition of Work and Welfare 

This technological transformation eventually dispossess ***half the work population*** of the jobs they are engaged in, forcing a total redefinition of social and economic understanding of "Work", "Welfare" and how the resources and opportunities within a domain are justly stewarded and allocated for the good of current and future generations. 

The technologies are dominated the rich, The Giants, and the political, so billions of citizens around the world find themselves frozen out of an accelerating system that is systematically transferring all the real wealth and assets away from the regular folks to the rich and The Giants. 

This will force us into a generational effort to ensure that every citizen is engaged in meaningful work that helps them, their community, society, and nature develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish. 

The indicator lights of meaningful engagement in economy and society flash RED.
