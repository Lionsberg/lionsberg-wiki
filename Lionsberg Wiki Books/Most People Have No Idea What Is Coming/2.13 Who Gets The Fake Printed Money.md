# 2.13 Who Gets The Fake Printed Money

So who gets the fake printed money? 

The fake printed money gets distributed by the government and banks, which means that in large part it ends up in the hands of The Rich and The Giants - Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Agriculture, Big Banks, Big Corporations, Big Government, Big Estate, Big Defense, etc., who parasitically prey on the citizens of a country for their own gain, at the expense of the Whole. 

The money does *not* justly "trickle down" to the wage slaves and retirees, who now find that every dollar they were counting on and labored for ***is worth less.***
