As much of the world has recently watched the movie *Oppenheimer*, it is crucial that we grapple with the consequences of weaponizing artificial intelligence to wage war against each other and the earth, and therefore God. 

If we do, its consequences are likely to be suffering and destruction incomparably beyond nuclear warfare. 

The Scientific and Technological indicator lights flash RED.
