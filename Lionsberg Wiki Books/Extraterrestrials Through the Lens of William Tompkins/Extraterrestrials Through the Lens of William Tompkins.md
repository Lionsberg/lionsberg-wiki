“We must prepare ourselves for the most earth-shattering news the world has ever known.” –Carl Sagan 7-16-02

I did not know that I know things that you do not know.

daughters. My Uncle, Dr. Harding, was the head surgeon at the Santa Monica Hospital at that time. He and my three cousins made many trips to the pyramids in Egypt. Their goal in Egypt was to interpret the hieroglyphics... home. All five of my uncle’s family members were convinced that deciphering the hieroglyphics would result in identifying the true builders of the pyramids, and that they were related to people from the stars, specifically in the Orion Nebula.

Two years later, in our small Hollywood apartment, I decided to build fifty naval ship models, all on a same scale. scale. On weekends, my father would drive me and my brother to the naval docks in Long Beach... Along with other visitors, we were taken out to sea in large powered naval lifeboats. We climbed on board the fleet’s battleships, cruisers, and the occasional aircraft-carrier, anchored in Long Beach Harbor... I mentally recorded images of all the new, classified equipment. On the drive home, I drew rough perspective sketches, and when we got home, I turned them into surprisingly accurate illustrations...  I then built all the classified equipment to scale and installed it on my models, which were subsequently put on display, by my father in the windows of local department stores. Seeing them, the Los Angeles Times interviewed me, saying I had a photographic memory. They took photos and published the first of hundreds of articles published worldwide over the next fifty years. My collection of model ships was appraised by the Los Angeles County Museum as “one of the finest collections in the country.” In 1942, Naval Intelligence became aware of the ships on display in the windows of the Broadway Department Store – located on Hollywood Boulevard – and investigated my father as if he were a spy. spy. They came to our small apartment and found all my sketches and drawings piled nearly to the ceiling of the bedroom that I shared with my older brother. Instead of being upset, they initiated a program (or, more correctly, a campaign) to enlist me in the Navy. Over the years, the collection would become 309 ships, collectively valued at possibly two million dollars.

I was convinced that some type of alien intelligence was not only observing our planet, but also influencing it... I’ve never accepted that these aliens were simply watching us. It seemed to me that, for thousands of years, they have been hostile, interfering, a threat to our way of life. Ever since I was that little boy, making secret sketches, I have had a preoccupation with our galactic environment.

On February 25, 1942, three months after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, a very strange thing happened.

At about 8:00 p.m. on the night in question, my father called my brother and me to our deck, which faced the bay. There was a strange, intense light just above the horizon: a narrow beam pointing towards the ocean. The little beam turned horizontally, right into our eyes, and hit the back wall of our apartment and the surrounding trees. It was blinding. Suddenly, and bafflingly, the light went out. Whatever it was, had gone. There was nothing we could do but stand there amazed. Finally, we retired to our beds. Just after midnight, the air-raid sirens and anti-aircraft guns of the coastal artillery woke everyone up. We ran out onto the street and saw a large round craft, about seven thousand feet up, floating in the air above us. It slowed to a stop right overhead and remained stationary. It was lit up by eight searchlights, while anti-aircraft shells burst all around and against it. Most of the shells exploded on the bottom of the craft – we just couldn’t believe the thing hadn’t exploded or been shot down! Three, then five, other ships appeared near it; some of the searchlights, as well as the anti-aircraft teams, focused on each one as they passed the first object. Eventually, the first craft slowly departed as well. Later, about twelve other craft passed by at higher altitudes and were, in turn, fired upon... crazy. Other vehicles continued to pass over us for nearly five hours. Our coastal, artillery anti-aircraft crews attempted to shoot down these strange flying machines. By 3:30 a.m. the main show was over. Unconcerned, we went back to bed, although several neighbors told us the air-raid continued and the alarm lasted until 5:00 am.

[[The Battle of Los Angeles (1942)]] eyewitness account

This so-called Los Angeles air-raid became the first major incident in a long string of events connected to the UFO phenomenon in recent history. And, it was the start of many encounters affecting my entire fifty-seven years of aerospace engineering. For whatever reason, the public may not have accepted the reality of what we had just witnessed. Another world had penetrated our lives.

I realized that there had to be a massive interplanetary mothership, or motherships, orbiting our planet, and from somewhere out in the galaxy. The mothership had dispatched hundreds of landing-type platform vehicles to the Earth. The nature of their mission was totally unknown. World War II was raging. We had our hands full with the Nazis, and now this?

Another person who saw the massive vehicles over Long Beach in 1942 was a Navy intelligence officer, Lieutenant J.G. Perry Wood. Lieutenant Wood, understanding the talents that went into creating my ship models, put together a mission-package for me and got me in the Navy. 

After being sworn in and having completed boot-camp in San Diego, I was assigned to a position in Naval Intelligence. I was working on advanced technology projects, having replaced a naval commander at the North Island Naval Air Station, San Diego, California.

My mission was under the direction of the Chief Engineer (a captain, to whom I was to report) and Admiral Rico Botta who was in Naval Intelligence. I was to compile and maintain a continuous survey of (a) experimental research laboratory activities, (b) other governmental agencies, and (c) educational scientific institutions, manufacturers, and research engineers. Upon my own initiative, or at the request of any bureau or office of the naval air forces.

I flew in almost every new aircraft in the Navy inventory, sometimes as the pilot. Among other assignments, I flew admirals out to such places as Douglas Aircraft (Santa Monica), Long Beach, and China Lake, situated in the Mojave Desert. For four years (from 1942 to 1947) I had access to highly classified programs and was involved in some of the most unprecedented advanced scientific programs on the planet.

The war ended, but it was not until 1946 that I was honorably discharged.

Ultimately, I went to work at Northrop.

I got bored... I then quit Northrop and went to work at the [[Cybernetics]] lab at North American, which was at the old Vultee plant. (While there, it turns out I saw circuit board prototypes stated to be made from some ET materials.)

In 1949, my brother and I got a job at Lockheed Aircraft Company in Burbank. When I was working at Lockheed, I became aware of a technical advancement into aerospace activities which was going on at the massive Douglas Aircraft Company, in Santa Monica. Again, my models opened doors for me. They had gotten me into the wind-tunnel model shop at Northrop. And, now, at Douglas, the Senior Vice-President was aware of my ship collections...in 1951 he transferred me into engineering as a draftsman. 

Because of my former security clearance with the Navy, the Electronics Section Chief, my boss, transferred me into the highly classified Advanced Design Section, a move that changed my life.

The events date back to 1945, and a top-secret report to the Secretary of War. Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, H. H. “Hap” Arnold, wrote: “During these years of war, our military has made unprecedented use of scientific and industrial resources. We must continue to have teamwork amongst the military, industry, and the universities. Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actual research and development.” 1945, and a top-secret report to the Secretary of War. Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, H. H. “Hap” Arnold, wrote: “During these years of war, our military has made unprecedented use of scientific and industrial resources. We must continue to have teamwork amongst the military, industry, and the universities. Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actual research and development.” In this report, Arnold did not, however, reveal his greatest concern – that some type of alien beings were here and that, technically-speaking, might be millions of years ahead of us.

Under the direction of James Forrestal, who was the Secretary of the Navy, on October 1, 1945, several high-ranking big shots were brought on-board, including: General Hap Arnold, Edward Bowles (of M.I.T., and a consultant to the Secretary of War), Donald Douglas (the President of Douglas Aircraft Company), Arthur Raymond (the Chief Engineer at Douglas), and Frank Collbohm (who was Arthur Raymond’s assistant). They met in secret at the Army Air Corps Headquarters, Hamilton Field, California, to set up Project RAND, a way-above-top-secret scientific think-tank. It was created in December 1945, as a special contract to Douglas Aircraft Company. 

Inside a highly classified, walled-off area in the Douglas Engineering Department, Project RAND studied the implications of threatening alien agendas.

Meanwhile, Frank Collbohm – under the direction of Arthur Raymond and Donald Douglas – had been secretly investigating the strange flight of vehicles over Santa Monica and Los Angeles since 1942. Collbohm would become one of the principal figures leading RAND.

In that same month of 1945, the new office of the Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development – to which Project Rand reported – was officially established, with Major General Curtis Le May as its first appointee.

Then, on March 2, 1946, a letter of contract was executed, which put Project RAND under the direction of Douglas’s Assistant Chief Engineer, Frank Collbohm. The [[Douglas Think Tank]] was born.

(The mission)... included literally thousands of problems in various fields, many related to addressing the technological threats posed by the aliens, considered to be thousands of years more advanced than our own technologies.

By early 1948, Project RAND had grown to approximately two hundred staff members, with expertise in a wide range of fields. The arrangement with Douglas Manufacturing management, however, proved to be a major problem. A conflict of interest was boiling, and a separation was imminent. It wasn’t long before the Chief of Staff of the newly created United States Air Force wrote a letter to Donald Douglas. It was a letter that approved the evolution of RAND into a nonprofit RAND Corporation, independent of Douglas, and that’s what it became.

...on June 24, 1947, I was still testing electrostatic field propulsion techniques in the science laboratory laboratory at Northrop Aircraft in Hawthorne, and still trying to make vehicles fly with almost no wings. It was also on that date that Kenneth Arnold, a private pilot, encountered a tight formation of nine disc-shaped aircraft. They were cutting across his flight path, at high speed, over the Cascade Mountains in the Washington State area. Although this was not the first known sighting of such objects, it was certainly one of the first to gain widespread attention. Hundreds of reports of similar objects quickly followed. Many of these came from highly credible military and civilian sources.

The military tried to ascertain the nature and purpose of these objects, primarily in the interest of national defense. They were, however, unsuccessful in their attempts to utilize naval aircraft to pursue reported discs in flight. At times, public reaction bordered on near hysteria. 

According to the so-called Majestic 12, Eisenhower Briefing-Document (EBD), mailed anonymously to UFO researcher Jaime Shandera in December 1984: “Little was learned about these objects until a local rancher reported that one had crashed in a remote region of New Mexico on July 5, 1947.”

The site, seventy-five miles northwest of the Roswell Army Airfield, became the staging ground for a secret operation meant to ensure recovery of the wreckage. “During the course of this operation, aerial reconnaissance discovered that four small humanoid beings had apparently ejected from the craft at some point before it exploded, fallen to earth roughly two miles east of the wreckage site,” reported the author of the EBD. All four were reportedly dead.

A determination was made that the vehicle was a short-range reconnaissance craft, which implied it came from a larger, mothership.

“Numerous examples of what appeared to be a form of writing were found in the wreckage. Efforts to decipher these had remained largely unsuccessful,” stated the EBD.

Equally unsuccessful, noted the author(s) of the Majestic 12 documents, were the efforts to determine the method of propulsion and the nature, or method, of transmission of the power source involved. This is not surprising, when one takes into consideration the complete absence of identifiable wings, propellers, jets, and total lack of metallic wiring. Nor were there any vacuum tubes or recognizable electronic components present whatsoever.

Although these creatures were humanoid, noted Majestic 12, the apparent biological processes responsible for their evolution were entirely different from our own, so the term “Extraterrestrial Biological Entities” or “EBEs” was adopted. It is virtually certain that these craft do not originate in any country on Earth. Dr. Menzel (allegedly of MJ-12) summed this up nicely, stating, “We are dealing with beings from another solar system entirely.”

Operation [[MAJESTIC-12]] was created on September 24, 1947, upon the recommendation of Secretary of Defense James S. Forrestal (formerly Secretary of the Navy), Dr. Vannevar Bush, and Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, who headed up the group. 

It is a Top-secret, MAJESTIC-Eyes-Only Research and Development-Intelligence operation responsible directly (and only to) the President of the United States. In turn, both the Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development and the Project Rand Group reported only to Majestic-12 at the time.


...to me, this planet doesn’t have a good reputation. It’s an extremely barbaric place to live. Granted, some of the black-hat aliens (aliens with what we would perceive as an evil agenda) are certainly responsible for instigating the hatred between our early tribes, before 1200 B.C. and in the years that followed. I have always been convinced that there must be civilizations out there that are not only far more advanced than ours, but also more civilized.

...early in 1950, I came on board at Douglas, Santa Monica. Because of my Navy Intelligence background, they dropped me into this tank,

My intention is to present compelling evidence of multiple alien cultures influencing our aerospace development.

It’s difficult to understand how complicated the idea of going to the Moon was to us way back in 1950.

The Apollo Moon missions were just the foundation for the [[Deep Space Exploratory Interstellar Missions]] planned by the Douglas think-tank and the Navy.

So, how did we accomplish this enormous task of going to the Moon, designing the Apollo Vehicle and Launch Center, and manufacturing all the equipment in the thousands of aerospace facilities located throughout the United States? It was conceived not by NASA, but at the old Douglas Missile and Space Systems Division in Santa Monica, California. Not only that, it was conceived four years before NASA even existed, by advanced design analysts in a think-tank who didn’t just do what they were assigned to do, but who visualized in their minds every step necessary for missions to the Moon, the planets in our solar system, and twelve of our closest stars. I was one of those conceptual thinkers.

As Engineering Section Chief, I conceived dozens of missions and spaceships designed for exploratory operations to the planets that orbit our nearest stars. I designed a station to be built on Mars, massive NOVA vehicles and equatorial launching facilities. I also designed multiple 2,000-man military bases for our Moon, and a 600-man naval station for all the habitable planets and their moons.

I documented what I did, made sketches, and presented them to my staff, who were the most competent designers on the entire Moon program. The results were astounding. I presented them, in turn, to the NASA directors, who then completely changed their unsuccessful method of development, resulting in six successful missions to our closest planetary neighbor.

Visualize a hidden, technical world where a block-long, five-story building, full of six-foot-high cabinets of electronic computers, power supplies, old-fashioned printed circuit boards, and wire-patch panels could just barely accomplish the mission your cell phone has probably just completed. Most of you were never exposed to the massive size of the computers we designed, built, and operated just to get the four-stage, 365-foot Apollo Saturn V Vehicle checked out and launched to the Moon.

(after 10s of thousands of years of human development)... nothing of a technical nature occurred until relatively recently. The first airplane, flown by the Wright Brothers, was built in the early 1900s. It was only 60 years later that man designed a massive rocket, powered it to the Moon, landed there, gathered rocks, and returned safely to earth, while every thinking person on our planet watched it happen on television. That is only a 60-year time frame. That’s less than a lifetime.

President John F. Kennedy was given permission to leave our planet. I say, “given permission,” but by whom?

Back in 1952, some unbelievable space studies came out of the Douglas Think Tank. They revealed that not only were certain U.S. governmental heads aware of the alien involvement in human affairs, but that the old Soviet Union was aware of the situation, too. With possible alien “assistance,” the Soviets were bent on getting to the Moon first, in order to establish missile bases there and control the entire planet. Oh, yes, that was a copy of Hitler’s plan.

***So why, all of a sudden in a microsecond of galactic time, did we leave the planet? Who wanted us out there?***

## Chapter 1

...I started to wonder if our government was having problems with some really bad aliens.

[[1951 U.S.S. Coral Sea - South China Sea]]  

At nearly the same time in 1951 on the other side of the planet, in the South China Sea, Admiral Steve (Mac) McDonley, a strikingly handsome six-footer, relaxed in his battle command chair on the bridge ten levels above the flight deck.

Mac was on this fantastic bridge with the most experienced personnel, and the most advanced weapon systems ever assembled on a naval warship. It was 2130 on a crystal-clear night.

He was Commander of a Battle Group cruising non-combat at 14 knots, consisting of the largest aircraft carrier on the planet, the U.S.S. Coral Sea CVB-41, with 97 of the most formidable nuclear combat aircraft ever assembled (Douglas A-3 Sky warriors). In addition, under his command he had two cruisers, four destroyers and an attack submarine. Mac, a former fighter pilot, was considered one of the top combat officers in the Navy. This was his first deployment as Flag Commander of an entire Battle Group.

At that moment, the entire flight deck was engulfed in a brilliant light, encompassing the ocean and all seven ships.

“Sir, my search radar screen is whited out, entire upper screen,” the operator reported in a low scream.

“An extremely large cylindrical vehicle is located 400 feet above our carrier.” Indeed, triangulation established that the object was over 8,000 feet long (1.5 miles) and 500 feet in diameter. It emitted a brilliant light source that encompassed its entirety.

For eight minutes, over 5,000 crew members of the Battle Group came up on deck and witnessed this encounter, knowing that they would probably never be able to reveal what they had just witnessed.
___
I got the feeling I had been there before. But everything was different. Before, it was like a conference room, much larger and with strange inhabitants.
___
I somehow knew that I had seen him before.
___
We were never told, but the team suspected, that the projects were based around extraterrestrial intervention. I was worried. Something was making a terrible noise in my head. My body began to shake.
___
Elmer Wheaton (the VP in charge, who got his doctorate at CalTech but never discussed it).

Dr. Klemperer, in his white smock, was our number two boss over the other PhDs.

Dr. Nick Sorenson, a geo-astrophysicist. 

___
1952 Meeting at [[Douglas Think Tank]]

“Today,” Elmer said, “we’re going to discuss the possibility of multiple extraterrestrial threats, and the measures we have conceived that the Navy should take to form a plan of action against them. We’re going to define defensive and offensive interstellar missions. We’re also going to discuss how we should configure our launch and landing facilities for our spaceship designs. “Since it is virtually certain that these other vehicles originate from a sector of our Galaxy, let’s open the discussion with the types of alien species hypothesized previously, and what sectors of our Galaxy they come from.

___
“We won’t land. If we have no resistance, we’ll park in orbit and launch our landing craft to the surface.”
___
“Okay, what we have here are two basic designs for Naval spacecraft carriers. There are two tradeoffs for configuration ‘T’ and one for configuration ‘J.’ All three are based on [[Alien Threat File Number 44022]], with the exception of the Nova III Exploratory/Drop Mission. Of course, these all utilize Dr. Klemperer’s and H.E. Salzer’s electromagnetic propulsion concepts. Both configurations for ‘T’ are 1.5 kilometers long and configuration ‘J’ is 1.0 kilometers.”

“It’s a given that the electromagnetic shields surrounding the spacecraft carriers will protect it from extraterrestrial light ray attack. If the ship were to fly through an unsheltered nebula at possibly **three times the speed of light**..."

We’d have to get the approval of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to use [[CalTech]]'s supercomputer...

“Naval Interstellar Space Operations are a way off, but they need to get some probes out to Mars as soon as possible."

“Oh, and, Bill, keep the configurations concepts coming. These ideas, if put into motion, could very well **ensure the fate of humanity’s existence and exploration into the Galaxy**."

Wheaton: “I’ve had a meeting with Admiral Davis since we first pitched him our concept of the threat of **submerged extraterrestrial vehicles**. Our next meeting will not only include Admiral Davis, but his staff, too."

"Bill has been helping us with the extraterrestrial USOs.” USOs were “Unidentified Submerged Objects.”

[[Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs)]]  

Wheaton: "We will continue to bootleg the funding from any program necessary for defining the missions, weapons, and galactic Naval warships necessary to beat the multiple extraterrestrial threats."

"...let’s continue with what is also a very high priority right now: our undersea and underground facilities.

Sifting through my system block diagrams, I came up with my conceptual DW-23. It was meant to be a “deep water” facility, which was a portion of our ONR proposal.

Bill: "What has come to my attention, and I’m sure all of yours, however, is that somebody in the Navy wants to research the bottom of the ocean extensively. I say this because the program requires the use of giant boring machines capable of operating in deep trenches and cutting into the planet’s crust. Now, it would be irresponsible for us to overlook their specific intent. The most probable assumption would be that the Navy wishes to monitor the extraterrestrial underwater and underground bases that have possibly been secretly operating all over the planet. That has been the requirement for years."

“Your presentation and our proposal, Bill, should provide the others with an incentive for recommending this proposal to Washington without any problem,”

“Who the hell are ‘the others?” Jim whispered. 

“Washington?” I whispered back. “I think. I thought we were working for the Navy?”

“I want to know, who the hell are ‘they?’”
___
Elmer Wheaton had contact with the UFO-cleared group in the Navy, which he referred to as “Forrestal’s people” as the ones who knew about the UFO issues.

One of the new young Navy officers who was cleared for the UFO topic appears to have been Bobby Ray Inman, and his inside knowledge of the UFO problem may well have been the special link to his subsequent highly successful career.

Apparently, Bobby Ray was the main person interacting with the Wheaton Think Tank at the time of this conversation.
___
Later, after another horrendous eleven-hour “rain dance” in the conference room, where we had a knock-down, drag-out session about the requirements for **a galactic Navy and the first twelve star missions**...
___
Bill: “We had agreed in Advanced Design years ago that **we wouldn’t be considering rocket or nuclear platforms for any proposal system concerning the galactic Naval missions**. Right? So, forget what that asshole, Edelson, was screaming about. Let’s look at it this way. The traditional methods just aren’t going to work. Utilizing the terms ‘annulling’ or ‘counteracting gravity’ usually refers to any means that would enable material objects in space to withstand the tendency to fall to the earth.” 

“Correct,” Jim agreed.
___
“The three different possibilities we’ve been working with are the annulment of gravity without cost in energy; the annulment or counteraction with the expenditure of energy, employing some yet undiscovered relation between gravitational and electromagnetic fields; and the counteraction by electromagnetic propulsion, employing an anti-gravitational device based upon principles in the existing state of physical knowledge.” “Sure.” “You and I selected number three, Einstein’s principle of equivalence, which is the theory of general relativity and gravitation.” 
Jim: “That’s right.” “It removes all other concepts that require vehicles to be launched one at a time from a station in Earth’s orbit.”

Bill: “We don’t need a launching complex like my proposal for our first Moon rocket. (that became NASA’s Apollo Complex-39). We don’t need a space station lunar launching facility; it’s not required. We only need the hangers."

Bill: I don’t think they understood. They didn’t understand that we’d established Naval operating times between stars, at an average speed of one light year or faster. That’s 186,000 miles per second. And some of our proposed larger battle cruisers may move at **three times the speed of light**."

___
"After extensive studies in 1953, Advanced Design concluded that UFOs were actually interplanetary spacecraft, piloted by extremely advanced extraterrestrial beings. Specifically, we resolved that they were the greatest threat our planet had ever encountered. And this was way before the CSI (Civilian Saucer Investigation) came to the same conclusion. People were being taken out – particularly those who were knowledgeable about the situation but wanted to talk. It began with the first Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, former Secretary of The Navy. Then it was President John Kennedy in Dallas. Next, Bobby Kennedy in the hotel. And who can forget August 5, 1962, when Marilyn Monroe got it in the bed that John and Bobby had shared with her? But why Marilyn?"
___
1951: Using **Klemp’s four propulsion schemes** that Elmer threw holy water on, Jim and I were asked to define the **Naval Stellar Exploratory Missions**. We were also asked to configure **several extremely large Naval spaceships** capable of performing the requirements of those missions.

We had no requirement for fuel; the vehicles needed to be self-sufficient, so the ship would require anti-gravitational propulsion.
___

Wheaton: "We’ve already accepted that there are many more other extraterrestrials out there besides the ones from Sirius, Alpha Centauri, and the Andromeda galaxy M-31. I have a strong feeling that some of them are from other galaxies, too."
___
Bill: “these thoughts **materialize in my brain and present images** of certain configurations. **They tell me** that these are the only ones that will meet certain threats, and it’s up to me to implement them at all costs.”
___
“How do you come up with your ideas?” I asked Jim. “You know, Bill,” he replied, “like you, I sometimes don’t know where they come from. The ideas just appear."
___
Note similarities to [[Nikola Tesla]] and others. 
___
For years, some of us had been simply giving ourselves credit as the top thinkers, never realizing that we may be frequently receiving information telepathically from a group, or several groups, of aliens. They had been influencing the design of our weapon system and spaceships. Thereby accomplishing their agenda – although, “their agenda” was not necessarily what was best for the planet Earth. There were some organizations trying to determine “their agenda.”
___
The [[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]] was comprised of highly qualified engineers from Southern California aerospace, who were interested in flying saucers and who were attempting to identify the UFO sightings that were occurring all over the world. Dr. Walther Riedel headed up this organization.

Mostly under cover for over eighteen months, the CSI continued without a hitch. That is, until the winter of 1953, when someone stole our files. As a result, our group was disbanded.

I confronted Dr. Walther Riedel of NAA on this one day and asked him what the hell had happened.

We had unofficially been working heavily on this project for a long time and, now we were just supposed to drop it, no questions asked? There were well over 1,600 eyewitness reports and case files. files. Who took the files and where did they take them?

We were continuing the CSI, with Kelly Johnson of the Lockheed Skunk Works, Jack Northrop, and my other co-workers at Jack’s place: Ed Heinemann of our El Segundo Division, Klemp, and Earl.

happening. It appeared to Walther that there were three companies involved in CSI investigating the UFO phenomenon.

The investigations were linked to developments in major propulsion (rockets) at NAA and involved **reverse-engineering of crashed and acquired extraterrestrial vehicles at DAC, El Segundo, Lockheed, and Northrop.**

They also directly affected **the Douglas missions to study the extraterrestrial threats**.

We were supported through the grapevine by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)]] and [[CalTech]].

Kelly, in the skunk works, Jack at Northrop, and our crew at DAC, were investigating and researching the extraterrestrial presence on earth.

Walther told me that based on the CSI Board questions to him, it seemed that they were trying to design and build extraterrestrial-type crafts, without the benefit of real extraterrestrial materials.
___
We had both talked to [[Jacques Vallee]] (a helpful young Frenchman involved in UFOs)... It now appeared that we were dealing with **many hostile, highly intelligent beings that were utilizing unbelievable, technically advanced systems totally beyond beyond our understanding**. Their agendas seemed to be different. **Nothing in our military was capable of preventing them from accomplishing those agendas**.

At one particularly long meeting, Jacques divulged his “knowledge concerning the Federation of Planets” – a sort of galactic governing force that limited the extraterrestrials of rogue planets from threatening other planets. Basically, Jacques was somehow selected, in contact with them, and was exposed to information related to their governing control of our planet. To me, Jacques Vallee appeared to be more knowledgeable than the CSI board members. “They operate a lot like an aristocracy of kings, queens, dukes, and so forth,” Vallee told me. “It’s not like our democratically elected government. They, the aliens, communicate internally and different from us.”

It was thought possible in the Tank that a galactic federation of planets (or controlling group of aliens) apparently operated and controlled some sixty stars in our sector of the Galaxy.
___
[[Project Sign]] was established in 1949 by the Air Force to investigate UFO sightings, but it became [[Project Blue Book]], when it got the backing of director Admiral Delmar Fahrney (head of Navy’s guided missile program), Roscoe Hillenkoetter, and Air Force General Nathan Twining. **They all acknowledged that UFOs were real and that they were a threat to Earth.**

They were tied in with the national security elite, who wanted it to be kept secret, even within the classified world.

But Major Donald Keyhoe nearly blew their cover with his book *Flying Saucers Are Real*. Of course, that was later covered up by the US Government.

Captain Edward Ruppelt, an Air Force Intelligence officer, who supposedly represented the Air Force’s investigation of UFOs, headed up Project Blue Book. Ruppelt hired [[Dr. Allen Hynek]] to support their investigation of the UFOs on the technical side.

He came to Los Angeles (the center of aviation), to investigate the findings of the CSI, having discovered our data through the public and private CSI meetings. Douglas, Lockheed, North American, Northrop, CalTech, and JPL: we were all involved in the CSI study, as well.

**CSI informed the Air Force (via Ruppelt) that they had determined UFOs to be real, that humans were controlled by aliens, and that the aliens appeared to be a threat to our planet.** 

The Air force confiscated all the CSI files. They didn’t want this intelligence leaking out to the mass population.

I’ve always found it extremely interesting, however, that after three years of study by projects Sign and Blue Book, the Air Force released information countering the existence of UFOs and their threat to the United States. **Ruppelt left the Air Force and Douglas immediately** hired him as a consultant on extraterrestrials for Advanced Design. **Several months later in September 1960 he died after a second heart attack.**

Dr. Walther Riedel, the principal head of the [[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]]. 

At that time, Dr. Walther Riedel headed up the Rocket Engine Research at North American Aviation, which later became known as their Rocketdyne Division. In 1949 his associates, included Dr. Gerald Heard, author of *Is Another World Watching?*, Werner Eichler, Norton H. Nolson, J.S. Newton (President of Leif Erickson Society of Mechanical Engineering), John Danied, Ed Sullivan (technical writer for NAA) and C. Barnes.

In an attempt to identify the UFOs, they had set up equipment to measure background radiation in a classified desert location. They had encountered large radiation bursts “for no apparent reason,” while a nearby colleague sighted a formation of three UFOs. This same group of scientists had also decided the phenomenon required further testing, and so had established the Civilian Saucer Investigation for this purpose.

Dr. Riedel: “I resurfaced the ‘mineral club’ information that we had discussed that contained the soil analysis of the UFO sites in January and February of 1951. They found a correlation in a secret Air Force project lab at AMC’s Cambridge Station, named ‘In the East’, which came up with similar test results. Essentially, high levels of radiation were found shortly after the sightings.”

“It’s hard to gauge since the sightings were so close together. The samples clearly read very high levels on the Geiger counter for both instances. The eyewitness accounts we recorded stated that the UFOs were silver, circular objects that flew near the makeshift lab. It was almost as if they wanted us to see what they were doing.”

“It sounds like they were baiting your team out into the desert to keep you where they wanted you,” I said, dread in my voice. “Why else would they want you out there? They may have some kind of underground alien military base out there that can’t be seen; their entrances could be disguised by electromagnetic fields. It might be that they were really testing you on your capabilities, not vice versa. What better way is there than to set up a false alarm to see how you’re going to react in a real situation? They could build better precautions through that type of testing.”

Struggling (Dr. Riedel) looked right at me. “Bill, it is possible that thousands of years ago these beings became technically sophisticated, developed the capability to move off their planet...” 

I finished his statement... “Left their star, and, now, their battle groups are cruising our area of the galaxy.”

He shook my hand and said, “Bill, **we need every man, woman, and child working on this. It’s the only way we can preserve the human species.**”

We were at war with a far superior foe.
___
In Douglas Advanced Design, we had been developing many of the physical concepts of [[Dr. Klemperer’s Unconventional Propulsion Schemes]], as well as designing spaceships utilizing their propulsion methods. 

We had spent **seven years on-and-off with these concepts before NASA put out requests for a bid on the NOVA space vehicles (NOVA was way before Apollo). The vehicles were *forty-times larger* than the Apollo Saturn vehicles**.

Because we had [[Dr. Klemperer’s Unconventional Propulsion Schemes]] that [[Elmer Wheaton]] approved, we were far ahead of NASA or any of the other missile contractors again.
____
Note from J: It may be that NOVA discussions with industry occurred in 1959-1961, followed by formal RFP in early 1960s. 

7 years leading up to that would have been ~1952 or so...

In the book [[William Tompkins]] has a section called "Pre-Nova Investigations" with a sub-heading *In The Tank 1953* which lines up. 
___
“One concept thinker to another,” Klemp had stated. He said that if we had a given electromagnetic thrust, we could combine the NOVA 12 type truck with the NOVA 16 and have a space assault ship capable of supporting a 30-man crew with a 40-man drop combat battalion.
___
Why build massive space trucks? Let me make it a little clearer. It had appeared from our studies of “the situation” that this planet was in deep you know what. This is because extremely advanced space beings had designed, developed, and built space motherships (space battleships) eons ago, and which are parked in our orbit right now. Normally, however, they spend most of their time cruising their territory of the galaxies trying to take over some other gang’s neighborhood, or slice of the pie. These bullies are in a gang that is thought to control hundreds of thousands of planets, orbiting thousands of stars. Our sun is a small star that just happens to be in one of their neighborhoods.
___
...do you guys get the picture now? Different alien militaries have been warring for control of our planet, continually, for thousands of years.
___
We at Douglas understood that **NASA was incapable of managing a program as complex as the Apollo Moon program**. They expected leadership from industry. Douglas manufacturing were waiting for Daddy to tell them what to do. Daddy had no idea of what to do and it was imperative that we, in engineering, had to plan the total program and launch facility ourselves and submit everything to the top of NASA.
___
Look at Douglas engineering’s successful missile background during World War Two. Our last years of operation of the Thor WS-357Air Force IRBM Missile led to the production of the NASA Thor/Delta Heavy, the most reliable, liquid rocket payload booster in history. The Nike Ajax anti-aircraft and Nike Zeus anti-missile Star Wars systems proved to be equally reliable. The exceptional warhead strikes in many Zeus R&D test programs included Nike Zeus missiles launched from Kwajalein Island in the south Pacific. They were designed to intercept ICBMs launched from Vandenberg AFB in California. **Photographed on theodolite, the aliens zapped and distorted our warheads on final targeting, preventing successful missions.**

I woke-up at 2.10 in the morning, thinking that I had learned a few things this year, and, for some reason, a great deal about those alien creatures... it just popped into my head. That **if I paid enough attention to some of their tendencies, I could predict what the extraterrestrials would do in any given situation**. It was very weird. I found this discovery unnerving, but, somehow, extremely helpful, too.
___
In light of all this (billions of galaxies of billions of stars and multiple universes), **it is virtually impossible to accept that we are the only fish in this vast sea**.

...the coming role that anthropologists will soon have, in terms of studying the thousands of different cultures out there, will be extremely difficult for them. The innate problems in developing productive relationships between us and advanced, exotic civilizations and cultures will be an even greater challenge. 
___
In 1952, during our studies of pre-NOVA and pre-Apollo/Saturn deep space star ships designs, we in Advanced Design determined that **UFOs were short-range reconnaissance vehicles operating from motherships,** not unlike aircraft-carriers. I had been of that opinion since February 1942, when I observed a massive wave of UFO activity over Los Angeles.
___
“The American guys were testing their rocket designs in New Mexico in the 1930’s,” I said. “The Europeans, who were attempting the same thing, didn’t give them any clues to go on. Both parties were unaware that anyone else was trying to do the same thing. Coincidence?

...And remember, a lot of these guys (in Germany) were doing this stuff way before Hitler came to power in Germany.”

“Electrostatic force accelerator beams, light energy stuff, ion propulsion, electrical oscillators, electromagnetism, counteracting gravity…”

Klemperer: “Now, yes, there are a good number of technical papers on the subject, in our RLR-744 unconventional propulsion. But as both of you know, those are not where some of the real breakthroughs are found, like that shoe salesman in Berlin, with his electrostatic force acceleration contraption that nearly worked.”

“Several of us feel that certain extraterrestrials, for whatever reason, have been **influencing these inventors telepathically**. Influencing them to develop a capability that will move them off this planet.”

"We’re living through the most complicated problem confronting civilization as we know it.” “It has been confirmed: Admiral Conway reported to Forrestal’s people, and stated that several, different alien craft have flown, and will continue to fly, into our restricted air space. They have operated over every one of our secret nuclear research facilities. When our Navy and Army Air Force fighters are scrambled, in an effort to get the aliens to land, the aliens respond by shooting all our aircraft down. Even our patrol aircraft are attacked and destroyed. They use some unknown ray weapon killing our crews. “**Since early 1948**, our pilots have been ordered to intercept and shoot down all the unknown invaders. Because we have lost so many of our top pilots and their aircraft trying to chase the UFOs, that order has been changed to, ‘Intercept but don’t shoot except in the case of an obvious maneuver on the part of the UFO.’

"**That order has never been revoked, which means we have been in a state of war with several alien hostile civilizations**. There is definitely more than one type of alien craft that have made absolutely no attempt to communicate with our military. They are extraterrestrial threats. They have even intercepted our missile tests at White Sands, preventing successful missions.”

William: “In World War Two, did Hitler hear about some of the 1,444 and grab these guys?”

Klemp looked nervous. “Well gentleman, you’re asking the wrong person. I will tell you, however, that every time the SS ever located one of these inventors during their investigations, they arrested him, confiscated everything he had, shipped him to an underground in-mountain research laboratory, and put him to work on their star machines.”

___
"It's not ours... The Moon; it's not our Moon."

“No seriously; I got another flash just now that it’s not even a Moon. It’s a station.”

“Flash indicated it was never our Moon; aliens towed it here in a pickup from another sector of the Galaxy several years ago; like ten thousand.”

“No Jim the damn thing has no core; it’s filled with massive cities... thousands of structures in there... Hundreds of control centers, millions of laboratories. Military research, medical."

“You know, Jim, the Moon never rotates like everything else in the solar system... I think we are really in trouble.”

___
On an early spring morning in 1954, the pressure of unknown threats from out there was unbelievable.
___
I was also a principal concept designer in Advanced Design for the Top-secret Hardsite Nike Zeus Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) System. It included a massive underground battery command control center, and an entire battery of tunnels linked to underground, rectangular missile silos.
___
Ignoring my question Store went on, “The GD SOBs **won’t let us in the target area one GD time**. We got clear 35mm tracking coverage from two of our theodolite cameras on private firings. No, Bill, they don’t actually touch our nose cone, **they are using some sort of beam to distort the missile.**” “Now listen Bill,” Paul said, “I don’t know what that bunch of hardheads that Elmer is listening to back at Santa Monica is up to; but **out here in the real world these aliens are at war with us and it is clear to us that we have no way to stop them**... this sinister alien thing is our real problem.”
___
During that effort I frequently went back to White Sands, New Mexico, where we were still testing firing our DM-15 Nike Zeus test missiles and improving tactical system testing checkout and launching operations. During these test firings, after the missile reached supersonic (Mach 1) speeds in our low altitude thick atmosphere, the rocket motor burned out, and a parachute was deployed for soft landing of the test missile, and to allow for recovery and post-launch inspection.

(Note tie to the story of the helicopter that was recovering a missile when a USO came up and swallowed it). 

The Douglas field station people were continually on my back, discussing various sightings of UFO’s. Every time I arrived, they hit me up to explain **weird performances of the alien crafts** in the areas all around the base.

Many times, they drove me out on the desert to show me sites where UFOs had been sighted or where there was evidence of landings.

___
I was the disseminator of information on the subject in engineering, and I reported to Dr. Klemperer and Elmer Wheaton, the V.P. of engineering, who wore two hats. He was V.P. of all the classified missile and space system programs. Unknown to 99.9%, Wheaton was V.P. of the above top-secret compartmentalized extraterrestrial threats research Think Tank, too, sometimes referred to as Advanced Design.
___
The imagery showed small disks following our missiles – and for around no less than twenty percent of the flights. They would streak ahead of our missiles, pull impossible 180 degree turns, aim themselves at the missiles, then pull away, just before impact. At that time, we were not certain that the aliens were preventing our missiles from successfully accomplishing their flights. But the missile test programs were continually being blocked by the aliens, which set back the development of the entire program.
___
This alien interference has continued on and off since 1955. In fact, it continued right up to February 15, 2005, when the new Star Wars missile defense – the updated configuration of our Nike Zeus – failed to even launch.
___
The missile was fully assembled, seventy-five feet long, but it was waving, rotating like a snake, still tied down on the assembly stands. It was also sparking, like little lightning flashes...

...six weeks later I couldn’t find anyone that remembered the incident had ever happened, except Admiral Conway and Lt. Hunter. The aliens must have an overwhelming control of our minds.
___
On many occasions, the Nike Zeus interceptor and the Atlas ICBM missile mock-warhead were diverted by UFOs in the last several seconds before being hit by the intercepting Nike Zeus Missile. This was well-documented by classified, long-range Air Force 35 mm cameras at White Sands Proving and Vandenberg.
___
These tests were successfully accomplished by us at Douglas Engineering in the late 1950’s (long before President Ronald Reagan proposed his Star Wars Missile Program in the 1970’s.)
___
The Boston underground launch complex (which I had designed three years earlier, in advanced design) was stopped when nearly completed. And just when we’re convinced the program can accomplish its goals and we’re starting mass production, a strange, black cloud comes over the entire program, hitting every major- and sub-contractor and test center in the country. And, yes, even Congress felt it, too, and stopped the funding. Who was it that didn’t want this program to accomplish its goals?
___
I had been flying up to Douglas, from Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, since spring 1943. I was staff to Admiral Rico Botta Commander, Naval Intelligence. I had his high wing DH-2 aircraft assigned to me as needed for these and other local, western missions. I visited Douglas every month back then.

Note: (ferrying intercepted German / alien engineering concepts to US aerospace companies)
___
Our Army Air Force and Navy pilots have reported over one hundred and sixty different, unknown alien craft that vary from race to race. Some of these are massive spaceships that are obviously capable of crossing the galaxy.

There appear to be different alien civilizations in the galaxy, all engaged in bizarre, dangerous wars, the outcomes of which might, one day, determine the future of humanity on our planet.

Even more important than that, we must defend this planet against aliens whose stars and planets could have developed millions of years before our sun. They have developed the technical ability to move off their planet and conquer worlds, with spaceships and weapons so advanced it could take us thousands of years to even understand them, possibly even millions of years.
___
...some of us in the Tank were aware of an extremely advanced Naval camouflage program, called “The Philadelphia Experiment.” During World War Two, the Navy was conducting research that utilized an experimental electronic system that would encompass the entire ship, preventing the enemy from seeing it. But something went horribly wrong. Under advisement by Albert Einstein (an advisor to the Tank), this program had accidentally transferred a Navy destroyer escort, the U.S.S. Elgin, bodily from the Philadelphia Navy Yard to the Newport News Naval Base, in Virginia. It did disappear as intended, but in doing so, its electromagnetic transportation system teleported the ship, killing over sixty men. It was, however, a successful application of collaboration of academic and Naval research into the previously unknown arena of teleportation.

...we overheard a group of PhDs stating that Einstein had been assisting the Navy in this teleportation research. Some of what had been published about Einstein was nothing compared to what he had really accomplished in above top-secret programs. (I was aware that the China Lake Naval Weapons Center, in California, had been developing more advanced research on this concept and others). The PhD’s elaborated on the idea that some members of the Tank were now aware of the possibility that **several different extraterrestrial races, including “the Grays,” had underground research and development bases in the western United States, some of which might have been operating on this planet for hundreds of years**. It was thought that they had been coerced and agreed to mutual research under the management of our Navy.
___
They were using a combination of an advanced telepathic communication system and an experimental Combat Information Control (CIC). (China Lake / ET facility)

"...let me tell you, personnel working in some of the laboratories said, over and over: ‘There are a lot of smaller-than-normal people.”

“You mean aliens could have been involved with Naval research back then?” Jim asked. Continuing: “Why would aliens build an underground facility across the street from the Navy’s largest advanced weapon development center?”. 

“Well, maybe the aliens were there first. It’s possible.” I held up a hand to calm him down. “Some of this makes sense. Remember Klemp’s slip in the program meeting, back in March? “Yeah.” “…that some of the [[Reptilians]] were really getting hard to deal with.”

“But, Bill, there are other scuttlebutts going on about Grays and Reptilians in there, too.” “Yes, Jim Cooper, propulsion rep at White Sands, told me that there are **Reptilians managing Grays in underground facilities in several Western states, and that the Navy is monitoring them.**” 

“Who the hell are the aliens that have been **shooting down all our fighters and transports?**” “There are a lot of unanswered questions. **Not just who are they, but what are their agendas?**”
___
Suddenly, I said: “I just got a flash that there is a massive facility on the back side of the Moon, I am frozen all over.”
___
Several years later, in 1956, Army Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, the Director of Army Research and Development and former commander of Army Intelligence, would propose a program called [[Project Horizon]], the title page of which is shown to the left. **Project Horizon was designed to place an Army base on the Moon. *It was implemented* four years after our designs for a Navy base and five years before President John Kennedy’s 1961 plan to go to the Moon** – which later became known as the Apollo Moon program.

___
We, in Advanced Design, had conceived and designed a two thousand-man Naval Base both on and under the surface of the Moon... Our program would be the largest planned technical effort ever attempted in the history of the planet. It was to include the most complicated, advanced Naval and Marine space operations center ever conceived.
___
Jim hollered over the noise of a smaller military aircraft, which was following the C-124: “Hold on, Bill, did I understand Corporate yesterday?” “Referring to what?” I asked. “If I got it straight, **Truman made a deal with the aliens?**” 

“Now, Jim, wait until we get inside.” Walking into the extended raised entry area, I grabbed my top-secret clearance card. I shoved it into the double-door slot-lock, which provided access into the Think Tank hall. I ushered Jim inside. 

“Like I was saying, **right after the Roswell crash in 1947,” said Jim, “I think Truman said they allowed a limited number of our citizens to be kidnapped every week, in exchange for advanced extraterrestrial technology, including new propulsion schemes, laser weapons, and extended life.”** 

“You heard right, Jim; Elmer said the same thing.” 

“But, Bill, Truman said that the fucking aliens dug in the ground, started tunneling under New Mexico and a bunch of other western States.” 

“That’s right, **there have been other aliens living under there in massive facilities for hundreds of years**,” I said. “The way I get it, it’s these new guys that are the abduction problem. After Truman gave away the store, they have been **kidnapping hundreds of people a week, on a massive scale**.” 

“Okay, but what he didn’t tell you is that **President Eisenhower sat down with aliens in a hangar out at Edwards Air Force Base in earlier this year**. He tried to make them live up to the pact. But the aliens got up from their chairs around the conferences table, literally flew to the top of the hangar, turned upside-down over the conference tables, and gave Ike the finger..."

(1953? 1952?)

___
I thought, grimly, that they must have Flash Gordon-style motherships, which have been cruising the galaxies for thousands of years. That meant they were technically thousands of years ahead of us. Maybe millions.

___
What we learned, much later, is that **the nineteen different extraterrestrial entities who are here on our planet right now** have the ability to control our minds and can prevent us from seeing them. In much the same way that their vehicles have stealth systems on board to prevent us from seeing them.
___
In Advanced Design, we were constantly trying to integrate data acquired from what was left of the [[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]] files, into [[Dr. Klemperer’s Unconventional Propulsion Schemes]] reports.

“I wonder why,” I said, “whenever the topic of the CSI is breached, someone cuts the subject short? The CSI is dead. Almost all the files have been confiscated by somebody; we think it was the Air Force. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: for whatever reason, I feel like I’m being assimilated into God-knows-what dark, government scheme. The wheels in the know – the Air Force – debunked the CSI. And they were the most knowledgeable about the extraterrestrial presence."
___
Why are these guys – the 4400 all over the planet – desperately trying to skip rockets and concentrate on electromagnetic anti-gravity propulsion for their spaceships, in a way that defies even Einstein’s theories? Why are they trying so hard to get off the planet?”
___
Jim, it just comes as a picture in my head. Don’t deny it; you get some of your stuff the same way. We’ve talked about this before. I’m convinced some of those white hat aliens are pushing us. They want us to develop spacecraft carriers and help their Naval space battle groups combat the black hat aliens.
___
Others had come up with the concept of building vehicles and propulsion systems to go to the stars long before my time; it’s in Klemp’s bible. In the 1890s, European farmers and engineers mortgaged their houses and conducted fieldwork on their own time, in order to come up with similar theories. But one question always plagued me: why? Who told them to do this? Was it human genius? Or intergalactic communication?
___
“Some of the staff may not be aware that [[James Forrestal]] was hospitalized for so-called stress-induced paranoia around this time,” I said, “and was pushed out of his top floor hospital room window during the night. He died on impact. If he was running the show, who is running it now? Are they the 4400?” “Take [[Klemperer's 4400]]” Jim agreed. “That’s got to be the most astounding disclosure ever documented!” “That’s right. It presents fascinating answers for why the Germans were trying the same thing we are doing, even before World War Two and in 1950 and why qualified experts all over the world were so driven to generate methods for space travel. And all these guys are doing the same thing at the same time!"

“Some of those people in the 4400 were scientists and engineers in Germany, and some were shoe salesmen. They all wanted to build a spaceship. They borrowed money, took out loans on the farm, and were in debt up to their necks when they were trying to get materials to build their spaceship. It was like they thought they could simply load their families and friends into their ship and fly off to some distant star.”
___
“Let’s do it. But, Bill, the German scientists and engineers have been designing space-type vehicles, too, utilizing what appears to be extraterrestrial information, since the 1920s. We have had access to classified documents that detail the exposure of the Nazi’s to extraterrestrial technology.”

“Remember Jim,” I said, “Germany has been building and flying the enormous dirigibles designed by the ‘Crazy Count Zeppelin,’ all over their skies, since 1895, and their futuristic cities had overhead monorail trams.”
___
North American, Northrop, CalTech, JPL, Dr. Gerald Heard, Dr. Walther Riedel, and Dr. Jacques Vallee... 
___
Or could it be the other way: maybe the aliens started all the wars to control us? I got the shudders again.
___
“Even Klemp said only a fool would fail to recognize that there could be hundreds of different extraterrestrial cultures out there, and some may be extremely hostile.”
___
“The aliens. They live longer than us, much longer. Two thousand, maybe even four thousand years.”

"They multiply faster than us and **they’re doing something to us to make us have very short lives**. It’s awful!”

Stepping backwards, I nearly fell. I’d got that tingling again. It was a sort of dizzying paralysis, where I felt like I was dying. “Is this another one of your visions?” asked Jim. “Uh…yes. It’s very clear now: hundreds of spaceships. Swarming… thousands of marines in combat gear… Oh God, their slimy reddish eyes look like open, dripping guts. They cover half of their greenish heads! “Staring into… inside of me. They’re here or coming here.”

___
Oh, but stop calling it ‘Advanced Design. We’re part of that CalTech turnkey operation,” (Barbara). 

(Note repeated links to CalTech)
___
I looked out over the nearly 900 engineers with bachelor, master, and doctorate sheep skins (degrees) that were totally unaware of the extraterrestrial presence on our little planet. They were all in their white shirts and ties bending over all those 900 drafting boards upstairs, in that recently converted hangar with the windowless noisy 2 x 6 x 12 rough wood flooring.

This sounds insane but I wanted to stand up on my drafting board and yell that it’s true, that we must all devote our energies to developing Naval spaceships with light beam weapons that are capable of stopping them. After telling Jim of my feelings at that time he agreed and suggested, “But not right now, Bill.”
___
**In 1953, we were very naive about the aliens**; that is, we were aware that they were investigating our planet, but assumed that they were just one civilization. **Not what we now know that we have at least nineteen types either here now**, or that have made a short visit as part of their cruise through our galaxy. 

I knew that they existed and was very aware of a number of extraterrestrial problems. I had no knowledge then of what we all know now today about [[Alien Abductions]]. 

It is estimated that there are (in 2012) 30,000 abductions per year in the U.S. alone. This is primarily focused on **interbreeding**, which, of course, is both unethical and illegal.
___
**1954 U.S. Army Chemical Sensing System**

During the early Cold War, the Douglas Think Tank had been analyzing strangely colored clouds that reflected almost the full color spectrum.

The chemical analysis branch of the U.S. Army contracted Douglas Engineering to design several sets of chemical sensing and analysis system mobile laboratories. I was pulled out of design as one of the principal system engineers to implement the program. Later, at TRW, this became a massive program that resulted in **the analysis of the extraterrestrial gases that have been continually dropped on our planet to control our minds. We are somehow controlled to allow them to use us as their crop. This is like crop-dusting a field.**

It was questioned as to why there were so many new infectious diseases appearing, first on the west coast, and then moving east across the United States every year. It seemed that the medical advisers who assisted us were extremely concerned as to why they were forced to combat several new and completely unknown flu-like bacteria every year.

These (mobile laboratories) were to be stationed all over the country and were equipped with the most advanced chemical sensing, analyzing, and compute- documenting medical laboratory instrumentation available.

We designed receiving and transmitting antenna systems equipped to provide past, present and future forecasting of weather data; the sensors were also used to establish rates of time required for the chemicals to cross the country and disperse throughout communities. Diverse sensors were installed to acquire alien bacteria that were then analyzed to establish their combined, as well as individual, effect on the animal and human population. We also assisted in defining flow charts covering all the central Pacific Ocean, east over Mexico, the United States, Canada and out over the Atlantic Ocean and the entire Gulf of Mexico.

I do not know what the real reason was for all the security involved in its establishment, but it appeared to have an extremely high priority.

___
Let’s talk a little about **the influence that the aliens have had on military and commercial aircraft design**. The first time that I was aware of that was when an unusually exquisite Asian girl was at a design meeting that was chaired by Harold Adams, the Chief Engineer of the proposed new commercial jetliner (later DC-8). She just seemed to appear when we were designing the Air Force’s XC-132 Heavy Transport.

Adams did not conceive the XC-132 or the DC-8, the first American Jet Airliner. They were conceived in Advanced Design, but the thoughts and suggestions from the girl assistant were uncanny. They were always precise and well presented, to the point that it seemed that she was the entire engineering department. It did not appear that she was limited in any areas of propulsion, aerodynamics, structures, or electronics. It was uncanny; it even seemed unnatural or impossible.

She also seemed to just show up and not be there at times. Was she, in some way, related to aliens? A number of the engineering section chiefs thought that was exactly what she was. I later learned she may have been only thirteen years old at that time. She was only seventeen years old much later when she and Harold took off in his converted navy minesweeper on their cruise around the world.
____
“We have been receiving repeated and shocking disclosures for the last three years. Like Kenneth Arnold’s accurate report in June 1947, about those nine interplanetary saucers in formation; east of Seattle. Then one crashed near Roswell, New Mexico.” “Exactly. And, in 1950, that first meeting where Truman gives the store away.” I replied, “You forgot the two weeks before the crash; that’s even stranger.” “How so?” “Well, on July 7, 1947, the Los Angeles Times reported that ‘airline pilots had seen mysterious flying saucers, much larger than transports, flying in loose formation at high speeds. The objects had been reported every day since, by observers in thirty-three western states. Military aircraft are still hunting the skies over the Pacific Coast states for sight of the flying discs.’ “And check out what else the Times said: ‘Then five P-51’s of the Oregon National Guard cruised over the Cascade Mountains in the Washington area, where the strange objects were first reported. They all carried photographic equipment. A Lockheed P-80 jet fighter at Muroc Army Airfield in California, and six regular fast-fighters in Portland, Oregon, stood ready to take off at an instant’s notice should any flying saucers be sighted in those areas.

“Then we’ve got this Eisenhower thing with the aliens, in early March 1954,”

"Remember when those five alien ships landed at Edwards Air Force back in fifty-four? They asked Ike if it was okay to continue selecting some of us and stuffing our heads with what is going on in our part of the galaxy.” President Eisenhower answered, “Well, I can’t stop you transmitting information to selected listeners.”

“That’s right Bill; **last month you and I both got one of those messages stating we must continue micro-computerizing our computers, to the extent that they are so small that they can power themselves right into our blood system. Flow out from our brain to the problem of a blown-off leg.**” “Yes” I added, “grow an entirely new leg with a foot and five toes in several minutes..."

“These aliens may be so advanced in all technologies, even futuristic medicine, that they have already controlled every type of medical problem and possibly live thousands of our years.”
___
After finishing my part of the antigravity briefing charts for Dr. Klemperer, I hit them hard in the Tank. I presented an understanding of the compelling issues surrounding the now-accepted fact that extraterrestrials had been operating their ships through the galaxy for thousands of years, not by nuclear means, but by overcoming gravity. This was disturbing to some in the semi-weekly meeting because the rumors I was referring to concerned President Eisenhower’s meeting with an elite, highly advanced squadron of extraterrestrials at the Muroc Army Air Base (now Edwards Air Force Base). This occurred in the desert of California in February and was not yet substantiated. That meeting had been prearranged and permission to land had been agreed upon.
___

The Nordic alien squadron had taken some control over planet Earth; it consisted of two large cigar-shaped ships and three 100-foot disc shaped ships. They were commanded by several alien battle groups, human-like admirals operating in uniform with their crewmembers. They demonstrated their military ability to make their vehicles disappear, reappear, and overcome gravity. Their message to General Eisenhower was essentially: “We have taken your planet and are requesting permission to tell your people about us and that we will make it better for them.” 

“What a line of bullshit,” I whispered to Jim. “**What about the control the reptilians and the grays have had?” They also basically told Ike, the most powerful leader on the planet, that he had surrendered**. Now, to say that Ike was pissed is an understatement: He had never surrendered. But, at that time, before reverse engineering of the crashed alien vehicles, Ike had no weapons capable of stopping them or the grays.” For some reason, however, I was convinced the alien take-over was true.
___
Elmer Wheaton, our VP of Engineering and the Tank, summed up our session with a directive to Dr, Klemperer. “You’re aware that those people from ONR laboratories will be here at 07:00 tomorrow morning? I hope you and Dr. Hurtling have all your documentation on electromagnetism and counteracting gravity prepared. Because Admiral Roscoe Donley, three-star, Commander of ONR, is bringing along Captain Steve Thorson and Dr. Jacque Tools of the Philadelphia laboratory. **They’re working with Einstein on their program to prevent enemies from locating our ships.**”

“Bill is an expert at presenting the physical concept, backing off at the right time, and letting me or Sheppard step in with the undocumented theory,” Klemp said firmly. “And he’s familiar with the five and six-dimensional concepts.”

“Fine,” Elmer said. “It’s your show, Klemp.” “Jim, did you see that Navy R40-2 parked around the side of the Engineering hangar this morning?” “No. What’s an R40?” “That’s the Navy’s high-speed transport; it’s related to a Lockheed Hudson bomber.” “So?” “That means we probably got stars – admirals – here, last night.” 

“Well, it’s about time they came here to find out how to stop the black hat aliens,” Jim added. I went on, “**Our admirals at the top now know that those aliens are stationed out there in their twenty-kilometer-long mother ships, just waiting for their admiral to give the word to attack us.**”

Later that morning in Advanced Design Dr. Klemperer said, “Well boys, we finally got the Navy brass out here and into our Tank conference room to brief them on our unsolicited antigravity propulsion proposal.” We all headed into our conference room – after introductions to the three-star Admiral Roscoe Donnelly Commander, Office of Naval Research (ONR) and laboratory director Dr. Jacques Tools.

“My studies have convinced us to seek an entirely new approach that does not employ the principles of rocket propulsion,” continued Klemp, “but rather **the direct transformation of electromagnetic energy into kinetic energy by means of the contrabaric state of a meso field.** The German, B. Heim, independently arrived at this concept by different mathematical approaches than I.” Klemp then expounded on the meso-field theory by postulating a 6-dimensional field describing not only the gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena, but also a third manifestation duly named “meso-field,” as those in the meeting could see on my chart No. 1.

“We envision this meso-field as capable of two different actions via the contrabaric state,” said Klemp. “The contrabaric state transforms a material phenomenon directly into propulsive action by emission of gravitational waves, resulting in an accelerated motion. It also transforms material phenomenon into the dynabaric state, through which purely electromagnetic energy is liberated from matter.” “Without any waste product or heat,” I added. “Propulsion is achieved by first liberating electromagnetic energy and then transforming it directly into accelerated motion, as shown on chart No. 2.”

“In every spaceship design using electromagnetic propulsion or anti-gravity, there is essentially no fuel required, unlike with conventional rockets. All that is required is a very small, slow, and controlled atomic reactor, as shown on Chart No. 8."

Admiral Donley said: “It seems you people are on the right track with answering the propulsion problems for our flagships. MJ-12 is on our back because of the extraterrestrial threats. What is your time frame for the prototype of your antigravity spaceship propulsive force configuration, the one shown on chart 9?”

**Tunnels Washington DC to California**

“It will be necessary to cross both the Mississippi and the San Andreas Fault, to accomplish phase three,” I said. Bob slid his chair away from our conference table and put his arms behind his head. He said: “The Mississippi hasn’t busted out since 1857, but it is the biggest earthquake on record. It split the country in two back then, according to this geology report I got here.” “Okay, I understand that, Bob, but read the Air Force SAC report. It specifically requires that high-speed tunnels that run from the Pentagon in Washington D.C. to Edwards Air Force Base in California, and then to Vandenberg, on the coast, be provided.”

Leaving the Tank to go outside by the airport runway, Jim and I walk briskly, hoping to see the Navy’s C-I18 land with brass on board: a four star and a three-star Admiral from the Naval Air Development Center in Warminster, Pennsylvania. They were invited by Dr. Klemperer for another review of our ion, electromagnetic and antigravity propulsion proposals.

Jim: “Before we have to brief the Admirals; what are your thoughts about the other really way out possible functions of your project 2104 antigravity propulsion concept?” 

Bill: “I believe, if we can use the right settings, it could actually provide the function of a machine to operate across time.”

"I don’t know how to say it, but I’ll call it; a time zone?” “Yes, and I showed the concept to both Klemp and Elmer who were very enthused; they said with further analysis it could possibly work. And before you ask, no, we can’t tell the four-stars yet, because the coming of free antigravity to replace nearly all methods of creating energy will bankrupt the oil and electrical cartels. And, assuming my concept works – it’s not really my concept; the aliens stuck it in my head – it will have the capability for us to move through time, which, I think, is part of the aliens’ secret technology.”

The Douglas/RAND scientists and concept conceivers were studying topics actually way above Top-secret. They were in a Think Tank, deep inside the Douglas Aircraft Company’s Engineering Department A-250, that nobody knew existed at the Santa Monica, California Airport.

What you are about to read is one of the most astounding disclosures ever published, starting in 1873 in Germany and later in the U.S. in 1919. This disclosure presents the fascinating questions as to why, from 1946 to 1950, technically-qualified experts all over the planet were so driven to conceive methods to leave this planet and penetrate the galaxies, all at the same time in our recent history. In the Tank this document was our bible. It was titled: [[THE INCREDIBLE DOUGLAS MTM-622 UNCONVENTIONAL PROPULSION SCHEMES]]. The MTM-622 consisted of a five-part document.

Studying the MTM-622 provided the Douglas Advanced Design group with a knowledge of potential extraterrestrial threats. They were threats of the highest priority, which is why we needed to conceive the most capable space threat. Naval intergalactic combat ship, one with a totally new type of propulsion system. This led to hundreds of primary design concepts and configurations for every conceivable mission.

...it was thought, at that time, that the Navy was totally unaware of the findings of MTM-622. And that after extensive configurations were established by the Tank, unsolicited bids could be submitted to the Navy by Douglas.

Title: Die Bewegungsenergie der Korpuskel des Weltraumes als einheitliche grundlage aller Strahlungs–und Kraftfeldenergien (The Kinetic Energy of Cosmic Corpuscles as a Unitary Basis of All Radiation and Force Field Energies) Author: Hans Schier, edited by Benno Fiala-Fernbrugg (Vienna)

This document is one of a few extant carbon copies of a ponderous typewritten manuscript of a cosmic theory purporting to explain gravity along with radiation. This opus was prepared by Benno Fiala (von) Fernbrugg (a World War I aviator in the Austrian Air Force and later engineer of the Junkers Works in Dessau, Germany, and friend of the later Professor Hugo Junkers.) Fiala resides in Vienna; he gave me this copy at the occasion of my last visit there in 1950, requesting that I bring it to the attention of appropriate American authorities.

The fundamental theories, hypotheses and calculations which are expounded in this treatise are stated to have been conceived and developed by Hans Schier, who taught physics in Prague during the thirties and lives in Vienna as a refugee from Czechoslovakia. His scheme is based on and referenced to older (nearly forgotten) “classical” theories such as those advanced by Le Sage (1782), W. Thompson – Kelvin (1873), Preston (1877) and Maxwell (1879), but allegedly independently developed, during the years 1925-1933 and amplified since then.

The fundamental principle of Schier’s mechanistic cosmos is the postulation of an all-pervading cosmic gas consisting of sub-nucleonic particles (which he calls “Ergons”).

Among the peculiar consequences of their theory, Fiala and Schier postulate the existence of an electro-voltaic gradient with depth in the bodies of water on the Earth notably in the oceans and they seriously propose to exploit this as a vast source of electric power.

It is interesting to note that theories linking gravitation with sub nuclear particles flying along enormous free paths at enormous velocities have been repeatedly advanced...
