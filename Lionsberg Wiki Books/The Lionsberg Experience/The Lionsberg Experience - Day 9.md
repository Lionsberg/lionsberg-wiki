# The Lionsberg Experience - Day 9

May 17, 2023

Welcome to Day 9 of the Lionsberg Experience. 

Today we have our **3rd and final introductory meeting**. 

Next week, we begin the new [[Lionsberg Battle Rhythm]]. 

## The New Domain of Lionsberg 

The moment the first 3 Members join, this initial triad brings a new Domain of Responsibility and Authority into existence. 

This New Domain is called Lionsberg. 

## Field of Agreements 

Lionsberg, like all [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]], is governed by a [[Field of Agreements]]. 

These documents are all a [[Work In Progress]] and are intended for your review and improvement. 

[[Lionsberg Code of Conduct]] 
[[Lionsberg Participation Agreement]]  
[[Lionsberg Membership Agreement]]  

## FROM The Old TO The New 

Our [[Quest]] is to [[Progress]] along the [[Critical Path]] FROM the **Old World** TO the **New World** in order to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

Because no one can be involuntarily left behind in the [[Old World]], this [[Quest]] requires that we identify and extend a [[Lionsberg Invitation]] to everyone. 

## The 7 Year Window 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that we are now in [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], and that these invitations must all be extended by 2030. 

## The Lionsberg Orientation Process Begins

The [[Lionsberg Orientation Process]] is a 12 week training and onboarding process designed to prepare Participants for meaningful participation and contribution as Members of the Lionsberg Community, while discovering a unique Quest that will start their adventure over the subsequent quarter. 

Designed to be undertaken in cohorts of 3 to 16 prospective members, this transformational journey provides the opportunity for Participants to dive deep into the Spirit, Wisdom, Principles, Values and Processes that enable individuals, groups, and communities to co-create and flourish together, and to begin discovering how to embody this New Pattern Language in a safe and structured environment. 

The first two cohorts are invited to begin transforming together the week of **May 21st**. 

## Changes, Improvements, and Consent

If any aspect of the articulations above are outside your [[Range of Tolerance]], please feel free to raise a [[Meaningful Objection]] and let us know the smallest change that we could make that would bring that aspect within your [[Range of Tolerance]]. 

Similarly, if you see any opportunities to easily make substantive improvements, please provide your suggestions.
