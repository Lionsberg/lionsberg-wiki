# Wiki Book Template

As a starting point, perhaps a Wiki Book has a main page such as [[The Book of Lionsberg]] that also serves as a table of contents / map of content / jump page. 

Then, perhaps at the book on a page there is navigation section that points forward one, back one, and back to the main page. 

For example, after this page you would see (something like) the following, which would allow for clickable navigation through the content: 

___

Forward to [[1.18 None Of Us Until All Of Us]]
Back to [[1.16 Dialogue, Circumambulation, and Speech]]
Back to table of contents [[The Book of Lionsberg]]
