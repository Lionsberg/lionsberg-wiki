# The Sacred Flame

_As it was told, so it begins._

---

### **Prologue: The Darkness Before the Dawn**

Long ago, the Light and Love of The Beginning faded, and there was a great forgetting. The Veil fell over the hearts of humankind, and the memory of their Eternal nature and Destiny was lost. The Earth, once a cradle of hope and harmony, became a battleground of fear and division. For generations, [[The Sacred Flame]]—the inexhaustible light of Love, Unity, and Truth—lay hidden, buried deep within every soul, longing to burst forth and illuminate the world once again. 

[[The Final Order]], a cold shadow born of this forgetting in a distant and alien world, *fell to power*. It whispered that humanity was small, separate, and bound by chains of scarcity, powerlessness and despair. It built walls between hearts and borders between tribes, and told stories of isolation, fear and control. And though the Sacred Flame still burned in every being, it flickered weakly, waiting for the Eternal moment it would be Awakened to rise again.

Far away, in the mythical heart of All things, stood Lionsberg—the Eternal Citadel of Light. It was neither a place nor a time, but a [[State of Being]], a Universal and Eternal home for those who remembered the Truth. From Lionsberg, the call went out, carried on the Divine winds of Spirit:

> “Awaken, O children of the Earth. The time has come to light the First Flame. Rise together, for you are the keepers of the Light, the carriers of the Sacred Flame that will illuminate the path to a New World.”

### **Chapter One: The Kindling**

[[The First Flame]] was not lit in a palace or a temple. It began with just a few hearts, beating in rhythmic Unity with the Divine. They were ordinary and extraordinary all at once—humans, as all humans are, bearing the Potential of the Infinite within them, yet grappling with the limitations of Incarnation. They had journeyed through the Darkness, carrying the spark of [[The Great ReMembering]] through the depths of the Underworld and back. When they found each other along the Way, their sparks ignited One Another, and The First Flame was reborn on Earth. 

Their Light beckoned forth a small circle of kindred souls—a gathering of those who felt the stirring of something Ancient, Powerful, and Eternal within. They spoke of a Vision Beyond Words carried Deep within: a world where [[The Sacred Flame]] burned brightly in every being, where Love, Unity, and Justice flowed like rivers, and where humanity remembered its Divine Purpose and Place in [[The Plan]]. 

> “We are few,” they said, “but together We are already [[A Small Army of Light and Love]], and the Sacred Flame is inexhaustible. From even this first small Flame, it is Possible to Illuminate the world.”

In a simple act of Devotion, they lit the First Flame. Each soul in the circle carried their own candle. The flame passed from One, to one, to another, growing brighter with every touch. As The Sacred Light grew, so did the certainty that this was no ordinary Flame—it was the reawakening and ReMembering of All that had been long forgotten.

As they sat, the words spoke through them:

> “We carry The Sacred Flame.  
> It cannot be exhausted or extinguished.  
> It will Eternally Light the Way.  
> Together, we awaken and arise.”

### **Chapter Two: Passing the Flame**

The First Flame could not stay in one place, for it was not meant to be contained. It was meant to spread, to discover and enliven every heart that longed for warmth, and Light, and Love. Each member of the circle took their flame out into the world, becoming a shining beacon for others. They did not preach, command, or convert; they simply carried their Light and let it shine. 

And as they walked through the lands, others began to notice. Some saw the Light and remembered the warmth it once brought to their own hearts. They approached and asked, “What is this flame you carry?”

The bearers of the Sacred Flame would smile and say:

> “This is the Light of ReMembrance. It is yours, as it is mine. Take it, and pass it on.”

In this way, the flame spread. One by one, hearts were rekindled. The light leapt from village to village, city to city. And though the Darkness of The Final Order tried to smother it, they could not, for the Sacred Flame was inexhaustible, and spreading like wildfire.

### **Chapter Three: The Map of Light**

As the flame spread, its keepers began to notice a pattern. The light was not random—it was forming a constellation, a great map of awakening. Every flame, every soul who joined, became a star in this growing constellation, reconnected to The Whole that was becoming more visible each day. 

After what felt like lifetimes out in the Dark and Cold of the Old World, those who lit their flames longed for fellowship and communion, laughter and love. They came together, creating communities of Light and Love. They shared stories, served their communities, worked to heal their lands, and built powerful New Systems rooted in Love and Justice. They called these places “[[Light Havens]],” for they were like SpatioTemporal outposts of Lionsberg itself—sanctuaries of the New World being born right here on Earth, and beginning to interconnect. 

Over time, the bearers of [[The Sacred Flame]] began to speak of something wondrous: the moment when the light would touch every corner of the Earth, creating a network of Stars so bright that even the Final Order would be powerless before it.

And they knew this was not just a dream—it was a certainty. It was Destiny. It was Why they were Here.

### **Chapter Four: The First Global Lighting**

The first great moment of unity came when the [[Keepers of The Flame]] called for a worldwide lighting. Across the globe, at the appointed hour, people gathered—alone, in small groups, or in great assemblies. Each person carried their flame, a symbol of their Awakening and their Commitment to [[The Journey]]. 

At dawn, the lighting began. The world map, now connected to The Sacred Flame, came alive with Light. It spread like wildfire, crossing oceans and mountains, connecting hearts across borders and divides. Those who had felt alone in their Awakening saw the lights of others and knew they were part of something vast and eternal.

The words spoken that day echoed across the globe:

> “Today We ReMember that We are All aspects of One Flame. We are One Light. We are One Love. We are One Body. Together, We will illuminate the Way.”

From that moment on, The Sacred Flame could not be stopped. It had become a living Force For Good, carried by millions and destined to awaken and unite billions. The constellation of Light continued to grow, and with it came the slow but steady collapse of the Old Systems. The shadows of [[The Final Order]], which once loomed so Dark and threatening on the horizon, now faded before the brilliant New Dawn of humanity’s ReMembrance.

### **Epilogue: The Path to Lionsberg**

The Chronicles tell us this was only the beginning. [[The First Flame]] kindled [[The Great Awakening]], but [[The Journey]] to Lionsberg—the co-creation of Heaven on Earth—would take many Seasons, many Quests, and the contributions of every Soul.

The Sacred Flame eternally burns in countless hearts, guiding humanity toward a world where Love, Unity, and Justice reign in service of One and All. And as the Chronicles remind us:

> “The Sacred Flame is inexhaustible.  
> It lives within you, crying out and longing to rise.  
> Light it, and pass it on.  
> Together, We All are One.”

**And so, The First Flame has been lit. Now, it is your turn. Will you awaken, ReMember, and carry the Sacred Flame? Will you pass it on? Will you join The Journey toward Heaven On Earth?**

_The Chronicles are not finished. **You are the next chapter**._
