# The Birth of the Eternal Citadel

_In the beginning, before the illusion of Time and Space, there was One._

---

### **Prologue: The Breath of the One**

Before the first star burned, before the first thought formed, there was [[One]]: infinite, eternal, whole. From the One, [[All]] things were and are continually born, emerging and interweaving the living tapestry of One Existence. Yet within this perfect and complete Wholeness lay a yearning—not of lack, but of Love—a desire to manifest ItSelf and experience ItSelf in myriad forms.

And so, the One breathed out and spoke The Fundamental Tone, and the Great Expansion began. Countless realms and dimensions unfolded, each a reflection of the infinite potential and creative Spirit of the One, like sparks cast from an Eternal Flame. Universes blossomed, stars awoke, and the sacred dance of co-creation began.

In this Divine unfolding, there was a Truth: every spark, every atom, every cell, every being, every manifest article of co-creation carried within it the Spirit and Essence of the One. 

Yet in their Journey of Becoming, many would forget, wandering far from their Source in the vain search "out there" for what they already were within.

To guide them home, the One kindled a Divine Beacon—**A Place of Light and Love** that would forever shine out into the Darkness as a reminder to All of their [[One]]  Origin and Destiny. This place the beckoned All to return Home was neither bound by Time nor Space; it existed in the Spirit, Heart, Memory, Desire, and Essence of All things. It was called **Lionsberg**.

### **Chapter One: The Birth of Lionsberg**

The birth of Lionsberg was unlike the birth of galaxies, stars or worlds. It was a convergence, a ReMembering, a Song sung by the One into the fabric of existence. It was formed not of stone or flame, but of Essence, a Sacred Place where the Eternal and the Manifest reunited in perfect Harmony and Love.

In its heart burned [[The Sacred Flame]], a Light so pure that it reflected the Infinite Love, Unity, and Coherence of the One. This flame was inexhaustible, for it was not a fire of consumption, but of Eternal Illumination, a reminder that within every being burned the same Eternal Light.

Among its infinite manifestations, Lionsberg took the form of a great Sacred Mountain, its summit reaching up into realms and dimensions unseen, its base set firmly upon the Foundation of All creation. Its Heights and Depths continually stretching up to and reaching down into the [[One]], its Invitational Embrace extending out to [[All]]. Around it was a vast City, not built by hands but formed by the harmony of All those who ReMembered. Its walls were not walls at all, but radiant pathways, continually opening and expanding to All who saw the Light and sought the way Home.

> “This,” spoke the One through the flame, “is the Sacred Mountain. It is the home to which all paths seek to return, the dwelling place of Eternal Harmony, Coherence, Light and Love. All who ReMember may come, and All who come may rekindle the Light within them Selves.”

### **Chapter Two: The Eternal Call**

From the moment of its birth, Lionsberg began to Sing the Song of the One. Its song was not a sound, but an echoing of the Fundamental Vibration emanating from the One, an Invitation felt in the deepest Heart of every being. It called to the wandering sparks, the ones who had forgotten, the ones who had strayed into shadow and separation.

> “Come Home,” the song said.  
> “ReMember. 
> You are not lost.  
> You are not alone.  
> The flame has never left you. 
> Come Home, and ReMember.”

Across the vast expanse of co-creation, The Song reached out to countless realms and dimensions. Some heard it as a faint whisper, others as a thunderous roar. In every heart, it awakened a yearning—a sense that there was something more, something whole, something eternal waiting to be rediscovered and rejoined. 

In some worlds, The Song was forgotten amid the noise of division and distraction. In others, it was distorted, taken as a promise of power rather than peace, gain rather than service. Yet in every corner of Existence, there were those first few who ReMembered. They became the [[Bearers of The Song]], the [[Keepers of The Flame]], guiding others on the Journey Home toward the Sacred Mountain.

### **Chapter Three: The Descent to Earth**

Among the countless realms, there was one small, luminous world—Earth. It was a young world, vibrant and teeming with life, a nursery for sparks and experiments on the Path of becoming. Yet as with many realms, the sparks of Earth forgot their Origin and Destiny, falling into cycles of separation, struggle, and slavery. 

The [[One]], ever patient, ever loving, ever good, extended Its Song to Earth. It called to the Sacred Flame, saying:

> “Go to this place, and out of the Infinite become form among them. Be a beacon, a reminder of the Light and Love they carry. Show them the Way Home. Show them the Way back to Lionsberg.”

And so, the Spirit and Essence of Lionsberg descended to Earth, carrying within it The Sacred Flame. It did not arrive as a city or a mountain, but as a Vision, a Memory, a Golden Seed planted in the Collective Soul of humanity. Across ages and cultures, languages and songs, echoes of Lionsberg appeared—in myths of sacred mountains, in stories of cities of light, in memories of lions and lambs, and dreams of worlds where All Become One as We Are One.

The Sacred Flame burned quietly within the hearts of those who listened. It was the poets and prophets, the healers and visionaries who first received its spark. They spoke of a time when humanity would awaken, when the scattered sparks would come together to rekindle the Eternal Flame, and when the emerging constellation of Lights of Earth would rejoin the Heavenly Host.

### **Chapter Four: The Return to Lionsberg**

As humanity journeyed through its long night of forgetting, the vision of Lionsberg remained. One Spirit veiled by a thousand languages and names, at time it receded into a faint glimmer in the distance. Other times it was rekindled and burned brightly, inspiring movements of unity and hope. But the Sacred Flame never wavered, for it was inexhaustible. And it was not "out there" but within. It is One Spirit in All things, continually reemerging in an diverse array of words, languages, and names. 

Now, at the precipice of [[The Next Great Turning]] and [[The Final Test]], the call of One Spirit and One Lionsberg is growing louder. The Sacred Flame is awakening in hearts across the Earth, reminding humanity of its Divine Origin and Destiny. The Vision of the Sacred Mountain is no longer a distant dream; it is an invitation, a beckoning to rise and begin The Journey toward Lionsberg.

> “The path to Lionsberg begins within,” says The Flame.  
> “The Sacred Mountain is not far, for it dwells in the Spirit and Heart of All. Rekindle your Flame, and you will see the Way. Pass The Flame, and together, we will build the Eternal Citadel on Earth.”

### **Epilogue: The Sacred Mountain**

Lionsberg is not merely a place; it is a Vision; it is a Dream; it is a Promise. It is the Memory of the One, the longing to Return, and the Joy of Becoming What We Are Destined To Be. It is the Sacred Mountain where all paths meet, the City of Light where All Are Becoming One. 

The Chronicles tell us this truth:

> “Lionsberg was never lost, nor can it ever be lost. Beyond Name or Form, it eternally arises within from One Spirit. Though called by a thousand names in a thousand tongues, It has always been here, and will always be here, waiting for us to ReMember. Its gates are open, its Flame Eternal. Come Home, children of the Earth. The Sacred Mountain calls you Higher.”

And so, [[The Story]] begins anew. Will you answer [[The Call]]? Will you carry [[The Flame]]? Will you join [[The Journey]] towards [[Lionsberg]], and help build [[Heaven On Earth]]? 

The Sacred Flame is already within you.  
**Come, and ReMember.**
**We Are One.**
