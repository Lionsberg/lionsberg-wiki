# Chapter 26 - Identifying the Problems and Needs - The Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues

## Introduction

Before we embark on the profound journey of societal transformation, it's vital to understand the terrain we tread upon. The labyrinthine complexities of current problems and needs are neither random nor isolated; they exist within a Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues that capture the intricate web of cause-and-effect relationships that permeate our social, economic, and spiritual systems. The Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues serves as a dimensional matrix that facilitates the understanding of complex challenges in a holistic manner. While it may appear hierarchical, it's crucial to understand that it functions as a dynamic web of interrelated issues. Each level, from the macro to the micro, offers different granularities of focus, all embedded within the same overarching reality. This multidimensional framework synergizes with The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg to offer a robust analytical grid. This model aims to deepen our understanding of systemic challenges, thereby guiding us in the intentional, Divine-guided transformation of society.

## Why a Nested Hierarchy?

One might ask why we need a 'Nested Hierarchy' rather than a simple list of problems and challenges. The reason is rooted in the intricacies of systems thinking. Issues are rarely standalone; they exist within nested structures of mutual influence and causality. In short, everything is interconnected. To tackle any problem effectively, understanding this web of relationships is crucial.

### The Meta Issue - Disconnection from the Divine 

At the top of this nested hierarchy lies the Meta Issue, which we might articulate as our Way of Being as a human species on Planet Earth; however upon closer examination we see that reason our way of being is fundamentally misaligned ultimately arises from our disconnection from the Divine. 

It is only through getting back in touch with the Meta Value and Meta Goal of God that all things can converge back towards Proper Order and Right Relationship. 

All other issues, be they sociopolitical, economic, environmental, or personal, can be traced back to this core disconnection.

The One Thing, that makes all other things possible... the One Issue, controlling all other issues... is the issue of Right Relationship with the Creator, One Another, and All Creation.  

## Tiers of Analysis 

#### Tier 1: Spiritual and Philosophical Roots 

Just under the pinnacle, we focus on spiritual and philosophical challenges that plague humanity. The disconnection from Divine Principles and the erosion of Wisdom set the stage for all subsequent problems. Each pillar has its own specific spiritual considerations; for example, in governance, we may find the erosion of justice and in education, a detachment from holistic development.

#### Tier 2: Fundamental Human Challenges

This tier delves into the primal and existential issues of human life—survival, health, identity, and more. Challenges like poverty, existential angst, and identity crisis can be mapped against the 12 Pillars for a multi-faceted understanding.

#### Tier 3: Personal and Interpersonal Issues 

Here, we explore the challenges manifesting in individual and collective psychologies. From mental health, to broken families, to societal divisiveness, each problem is examined through the lens of the 12 Pillars to discern their unique attributes and shared origins.
#### Tier 4: Localized Symptoms 

The problems at this tier manifest in local, community, or bioregional settings. These can include localized economic disparities, educational gaps, community-specific health crises, or issues with food and supply chains, often serving as illuminating microcosms of larger systemic problems.

#### Tier 5: Systemic Manifestations 

The systemic issues are those that have become codified in institutions and laws, perpetuating cycles of harm. For instance, corruption in governance or inequality in educational systems can be traced back to spiritual disconnection and fundamental human challenges.

#### Tier 6: Societal Dysfunction

This tier encompasses broader societal problems that affect entire nations or global populations—like systemic racism, mass migration due to conflicts, or global economic disparity.

#### Tier 7: Ecological Disintegration

At the final tier, we discuss challenges like environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental disasters that have a global and long-lasting impact, often irreversible if not addressed holistically. Whereas Tier 1 addresses the disconnection of humanity from the Divine, Tier 7 addresses the disintegration of humanity from the Living System that sustains it. 

## The Dynamic Web of Issues

Although categorized, these issues do not exist in isolation. They are nodes in a network, each affecting and influenced by the others. For instance, "Unsustainable Economics" can be both a cause and a consequence of "Environmental Degradation."

## The Role of Sovereign Citizens

Recognizing the nested interplay of these issues enables Sovereign Citizens to target interventions with precision, while also acknowledging the bigger picture. Rooted in Divine Wisdom, each citizen becomes both diagnostician and healer in the collective journey toward redemption and enlightenment.

## Aligning with the Lionsberg Blueprint

Each identified issue will find its place within the overall Lionsberg strategy, enabling a comprehensive, citizen-led transformation that touches every aspect of life. This integrated approach will empower every individual to become an active participant in the grand transformation.

## Conclusion

The Total Nested Hierarchy of Issues serves as a comprehensive diagnostic tool for identifying, analyzing, and understanding the multi-layered problems facing humanity. It is intended to work in tandem with its positive parallel, the Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals, underpinned by the same 12 Pillars of Lionsberg. This duality ensures a balanced approach, incorporating both the challenges to overcome and the opportunities to seize, as we collectively strive for the establishment of the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

Community Notes: 

### Refinement Considerations:

1. **Dynamic Interrelationships**: While the model is hierarchical, it's crucial to recognize the interplay and feedback loops between different tiers. For example, 'Societal Dysfunction' can lead to 'Personal and Interpersonal Issues', and vice versa. Some kind of notation or mapping could signify these relationships.
    
2. **Pillar Adaptability**: The 12 Pillars of Lionsberg are presumed to be static. However, as society evolves, there may be a need for revisiting, revising, or even expanding these pillars.
    
3. **Inclusion of Positive Forces**: While the framework focuses on challenges and issues, incorporating a parallel hierarchy for opportunities, strengths, and virtues could provide a more balanced and holistic view.
    
4. **Granular Benchmarking**: Consider adding sub-tiers or metrics to evaluate progress or severity within each tier. This could help in resource allocation and strategic planning.
    
5. **Methodologies for Problem-Solving**: While the framework identifies and categorizes issues, there might be value in attaching specific problem-solving methodologies that are most effective for each tier.
    
6. **Implementation Protocols**: Once issues are identified and analyzed, the framework could benefit from an associated procedural guide for translating these insights into actions, ideally matched to the respective Pillars.
    
7. **Stakeholder Input**: Given the citizen-led transformation focus, incorporating a mechanism for public input and collective wisdom could make the framework even more adaptive and grounded.
    
8. **Spiritual Reassessment**: Given that the highest tier focuses on spiritual and philosophical roots, periodic spiritual reassessment could help to ensure alignment with Divine Principles.
    
9. **Interdisciplinary Synergies**: Since the issues span multiple sectors, consideration could be given to how knowledge and best practices can be shared across pillars and tiers.
    
10. **Resource Mapping**: For effective operationalization, each issue could be tagged with necessary resources for its resolution, be they human, financial, technological, or informational.
