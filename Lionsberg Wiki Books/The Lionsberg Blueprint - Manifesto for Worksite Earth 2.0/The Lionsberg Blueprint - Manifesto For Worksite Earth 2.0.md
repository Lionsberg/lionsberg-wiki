# The Lionsberg Blueprint - Manifesto For Worksite Earth v.2.0

Welcome to the [[Force For Good]]. We The People are glad you are here. 

## A Brief Orientation

1. For a brief overview of the Lionsberg System and Approach, the following are the best starting points: 
	1. The [[One Sentence]] question
	2. The [[Lionsberg Introduction]]
	3. The [[Lionsberg Manifesto]]
	4. The One Page and Executive Summaries below. 
	5. Skimming the chapter titles on this page to catch the essence  
2. This longer **Manifesto v2.0** expands upon the original significantly, delving deeper into context, strategy, structure, planning, resourcing and operationalization, with the Aim of serving as a more comprehensive Blueprint for The Movement. 
3. This [[Lionsberg Wiki Book]] is a [[Work In Progress]]. The live links are to the chapters that have already been published. They provide an overview of: 
	1. The **Meta Crisis** and proposed **Meta Solution** (Chapters 1-10)
	2. The **imperative** for a **New System and Approach** (Chapters 11-15)
	3. The **Genesis** and **Mission** of **Lionsberg** (Chapters 16 and 17)
	4. The **Lionsberg Strategy** and **Work Breakdown Structure** (Chapters 24 and 25). 
	5. And more, with other sections coming soon; a quick skim of their titles will give you a sense of what lies ahead. 
4. For a deeper dive, visit the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] bookshelf, where you will find thousands of interlinked pages circumambulating these issues from a variety of angles, including [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]. 
5. If you are not accustomed to Spiritual and Religious Language, please read [[A Note On Spiritual and Religious Language]] below as an orientation to our intentional use of these powerful tools. Like the United States Constitution, the Lionsberg System appeals to the Creator / God as the Transcendent Source of our Sovereignty, Inalienable Rights and Responsibilities, and Indivisibility, while explicitly protecting freedom of thought, speech, belief, and religious expression.
