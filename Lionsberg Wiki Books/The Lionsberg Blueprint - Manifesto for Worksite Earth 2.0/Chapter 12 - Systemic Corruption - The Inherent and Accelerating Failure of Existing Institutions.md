# Chapter 12 - Systemic Corruption - The Inherent and Accelerating Failure of Existing Institutions

## Introduction

Having established in the preceding chapter that the present systems, despite their historic contributions and improvements upon the past, are inherently inadequate to usher us into a just and sustainable future, it is critical to understand why they are not just ineffective but are, in fact, accelerating humanity and the Living System toward failure. This chapter aims to deconstruct the inherently corrupt structures, mechanisms, and incentives that are leading our institutions to not just a point of stasis but an inevitable degradation. It argues that systemic corruption is not an aberration but an inherent feature of these outdated systems—designed for a different era and ill-suited for contemporary challenges, let alone future ones.

## Intrinsic Flaws: Designing Systems for Simplicity in a Complex World

The present systems were not designed with the complexities and demands of today's globalized world in mind. They were crafted for simpler times, often without the insights we now have into systems thinking, ecological balances, and human psychology. This incongruence between design and demand makes these systems intrinsically flawed, incapable of self-correction, and prone to what can best be described as systemic corruption.

## The Corrosion of Academic and Scientific Enterprise by Political Ideology

In an ideal world, academia and scientific research would be the bedrocks of objective truth-seeking, untainted by biases and free from external pressures. They would serve as pillars supporting a just society and the continual advancement of human knowledge. However, the current landscape paints a starkly different picture, illustrating how political ideology has infiltrated and, in some cases, subverted these critical institutions.

### Intellectual Homogenization

The academic sphere has increasingly become an echo chamber, where certain ideologies dominate, and dissenting voices are marginalized. This intellectual homogenization, often manifesting under the guise of consensus, significantly undermines academic integrity and stifles groundbreaking inquiry. It corrupts the very foundation of academia, which is supposed to thrive on debate, skepticism, and the fearless pursuit of knowledge.

### Politicization of Research Funding

The lifeblood of scientific research—funding—is often directed by political machinations rather than objective assessments of societal or scientific need. Politically motivated funding corrupts the scientific process by dictating what areas are worthy of study and by default, what conclusions are more likely to be supported. This distorts the scientific landscape, creating pockets of hyper-focused research that may lack broader relevance or applicability but serve specific ideological agendas.

### Publication Bias and The 'File Drawer' Problem

The pressure to produce results that align with prevailing ideologies often leads to a significant publication bias. Studies that confirm existing beliefs are more likely to be published, cited, and publicized, while those that offer contradictory findings are relegated to the proverbial 'file drawer.' This practice corrupts the academic record, creates false narratives, and hampers genuine advancements in understanding.

### Instrumentalization of Peer Review

Peer review, once considered the gold standard of academic integrity, has come under scrutiny for its susceptibility to ideological bias. Instead of serving as an impartial vetting process, it can often act as a gatekeeping mechanism, where reviewers from dominant ideological backgrounds marginalize or discredit work that does not conform to their views, thereby perpetuating a cycle of academic corruption.

### Commodification of Education and Research

The commercial pressures on academia—ranging from the push for profitable research partnerships to the transformation of education into a marketable commodity—further compromise its integrity. When profit motives collide with ideological leanings, the result is a corrupted system that serves neither the pursuit of knowledge nor the betterment of society but instead amplifies existing biases and divisions.

### Ethical Deterioration

The intersection of political ideology and academic endeavor also erodes the ethical underpinnings of these institutions. Objectivity and the pursuit of truth are often sacrificed on the altar of ideological conformity, leading to questionable research practices, data manipulation, and the stifling of academic freedom.

### Undermining the Universality of Knowledge

One of the most profound ramifications of this corrosion is the undermining of the notion that knowledge and truth are universal. When academic and scientific enterprises are dictated by ideological biases, they cease to serve humanity at large and instead become tools for power consolidation and social engineering.

### The Corruption of Science and Academics as Case Study and Canary in the Coal Mine

The infiltration of political ideology into academic and scientific institutions is a pernicious form of systemic corruption that undermines the quest for objective truth and hampers societal progress. It is a deviation from the universal and eternal Logos, representing a forfeiture of wisdom and discernment in favor of temporal and divisive politicized agendas. In this critical juncture of history, cleansing these institutions from such corrupting influences becomes imperative for the establishment of a society rooted in true justice, aligned with the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven.

The case study of the corruption of Science and Academics by political ideologies is highlighted because of all areas of human institution, these should theoretically be the most pure in their pursuit of unbiased and genuine Truth. If even our societal institutions explicitly designed around Truth and Knowledge have been insidiously corrupted by politics, ideology, and deceit, it follows that the other institutions of politics and economy, openly self-interested and self-serving in nature, would be plagued by a far worse state of internal decay as a result of the betrayal of Truth and the instrumentalization of words, tools, and power. 

## The Corrosion of Idea Meritocracy

The ideal of a meritocratic society in which the best Ideas and Ideals prevail has been undermined by multiple factors, including the concentration of resources, nepotism, regulatory capture, ideological capture, identity politics, and systems that prioritize external characteristics over true Character, Ability, and Wisdom. Even though a meritocratic society is a key component for the efficient functioning of systems and equality of opportunity, our current frameworks reward exploitative behavior and encourage individuals to forsake ethical considerations for personal gain, creating a closed loop of escalating corruption. When these corrosive spirals are paired with the overt politicization of institutions and their corruption of false ideologies, it accelerates the doom loop. 

## Death by Short-Termism

The planning horizons for most of our institutions are increasingly shrinking as social media trends, daily news, quarterly returns, and election cycles increasingly dominate performance evaluation. This institutionalized short-termism incentivizes decision-makers to prioritize immediate gains at the expense of long-term Wisdom and Regenerativity. Whether it is political leaders focusing on the next election cycle, corporations on the next quarterly earnings report, or individuals on immediate gratification, this short-sightedness is a form of systemic corruption that sacrifices the future for the present in direct contradiction to the essence of Wisdom and the Perspective of God that gazes across the millennia.

## The Cult of Capital and Shareholder Primacy in Corporations

The contemporary corporate ethos, dominated by the cult of capital and shareholder value, neglects other stakeholders, from employees, to communities, to the environment. This is a fertile ground for corruption and exploitation, as the institutional focus is narrowed down to capital-maximizing financial metrics, often manipulated for short-term gains. This corporate culture creates a corrupt system that is blind to the collective good and deaf to ethical considerations, as increasingly large soulless Giants roam the Earth, exploiting society and the environment for their own gain, while externalizing costs and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.

## Regulatory Deterioration and the Iron Triangle

Even systems that are designed to combat corruption, like regulatory bodies, are prone to deteriorate over time. This is often seen in the form of the Iron Triangle, where regulatory agencies, the entities they regulate, and politicians create a cycle of mutual benefit at the expense of the public and the greater good. This collusive institutional entanglement not only hinders effective regulation but actively promotes systemic corruption, and grows worse over time if left unchecked.

## Media Complicity: Narratives over News

A free press is often considered the fourth pillar of democracy. However, in our present systems, media entities are increasingly becoming mouthpieces for political or corporate agendas, continually spewing propaganda intentionally aimed at deceiving and manipulating the population. The co-opting of the media results in a disinformation landscape that serves to perpetuate systemic corruption rather than expose it.

## Religion's Unholy Alliances

The intersection of religion with political and economic power has led to unholy alliances that serve to maintain rather than challenge the status quo. Instead of uplifting humanity and maintaining a moral compass, these alliances often sanctify systemic corruption under the cloak of piety, forcing religious leaders to bow their knee to political and economic power structures rather to God.

## Global Governance: A Farce of Unity

On a global scale, entities like the United Nations, instead of serving as a forum for fostering unity and collective action, have become arenas where powerful nations competitively exercise power for their own benefit, often intentionally subverting the common good. The inability of such international institutions to counter systemic corruption and the illusion of collective representation makes them complicit in the perpetuation of the failing Old Systems.

## Collusion at the Highest Levels: A Web of Deception and Control

The manifestation of corruption and injustice is not isolated to academic, scientific, political, religious, and social institutions; it extends into and interlinks the apparently separate corridors of global power where intelligence agencies, big tech, big media, big politics, and big religion have been implicated in collusion to perpetuate a deceitful and failing status quo that serves a narrow elite at the expense of the broader populace and the Living System that sustains us. This confluence of powerful entities works in synergy to manipulate public perception, control information flow, and maintain existing hierarchies of exploitation, thereby undermining the foundation of a Just, Transparent, and Accountable society.

### Coordinated Information Control

One of the most potent weapons in the arsenal of these colluding powers is the ability to control the narrative. Intelligence agencies and big tech have unprecedented access to personal data, and they wield this information to influence public opinion. Coupled with the narrative-setting power of big media, an environment is created where dissenting voices are censored, marginalized, or discredited, often under the pretext of combating misinformation. This false-paradigm sets up a corrupt and collusive failing power structure to be the centralized mediator of what constitutes "truth" and "misinformation", a primary recipe for accelerating humanity towards hell on Earth. 

### Propaganda Machinery

Big media and big politics often act as a revolving door for each other, where media moguls become political advisors, politicians become news pundits, and government spending on advertising perpetuates deceitful outlets that would otherwise fail, leading to the capture of media channels by the collusive elite. This blurred line creates a propaganda machinery that works tirelessly to normalize specific ideologies and policies, thereby manipulating public consciousness and limiting the intellectual horizons of society. The intentional corrosion of Truth and conscious corruption of the minds of a populace is among the greatest crimes against Sovereign Citizens, perpetuated by State, Corporate, Capital, Political, and even Religious actors. 

### Financial Dependencies

The collusion is further cemented by intricate financial ties. Intelligence agencies, with access to enormous black budgets, can influence both technological development and media narratives. Big religion, with its vast resources, often invests in or directly supports media and tech enterprises that align with their narrow doctrinal or ideological perspectives, subtly shifting the global conversation in deceitful ways in the name of God. Spending from SuperPacs, Government Agencies, and Big Corporations on deceitful messages is the lifeblood of Big Media, creating total capture. Media access to various segments of the population, in turn, makes political parties dependent upon them for ongoing revenue and support. 

### Religious Co-optation

Big religion's role is especially significant in this web of collusion. Instead of acting as a moral compass and a voice for justice, organized religion, at its highest echelons, often becomes a partner in this corrupt system, trading spiritual authenticity for social and political influence. This compromises the transformative power of faith communities to seek and speak Truth and bring about societal renewal aligned with universal principles of Justice and Love, in genuine partnership and right relationship to God.

### Global Policy Manipulation

The threads of this collusion often extend to international politics, where decisions affecting millions are made behind closed doors, shrouded in secrecy. This lack of transparency is a fertile ground for corruption, allowing the elite to craft policies that serve their interests, often at the expense of justice, liberty, equality, and human dignity. As a result, hundreds of millions of Citizens continue to dwell in artificially imposed suffering and privation, lacking access to basics like food, security, and shelter. 

### The End Game: Power Consolidation

The ultimate aim of this collusion is the ongoing consolidation of power in the hands of a select few Giants. By controlling the flow of information, influencing public opinion, and manipulating policy, The Giants create a self-sustaining loop of power accumulation at the expense of Whole that stifles genuine social, political, and spiritual progress towards The Goal. 

The revelation of collusion at the highest levels is not a conspiracy theory but an observable phenomenon, substantiated by an increasing body of evidence that grows daily. This systemic corruption, deeply antithetical to the Logos and the eternal principles of Justice and Righteousness, impedes the realization of a society aligned with the Kingdom and Principles of God. Disrupting this insidious web requires an informed populace, courageous leadership, and an unflinching commitment to truth, justice, and the betterment of the human condition.

## Conclusion: The Clock Is Ticking

Systemic corruption is not a bug but a feature of our existing institutional frameworks. These systems are not only ill-equipped to meet the demands of today's complex world but are fundamentally designed in a way that promotes corruption and actively inhibits genuine reform. Our analysis thus far makes one thing abundantly clear: time is running out. The deterioration is not linear but exponential, and as we hurdle toward a point of no return, the necessity for a new paradigm becomes ever more urgent.

Given the intrinsic and accelerating failure mechanisms built into these systems, we can no longer afford the folly of incremental reform. What is needed now is nothing short of a radical reimagining—a New Covenant founded upon timeless wisdom and enabled by cutting-edge technology—to transcend these failing structures, forge a clean New meeting place, and work together in partnership with God and One Another to transform them into collaborative systems genuinely capable of aiding in the manifestation of the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
