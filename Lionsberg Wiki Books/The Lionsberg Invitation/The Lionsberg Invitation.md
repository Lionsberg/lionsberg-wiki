# The Lionsberg Invitation

Greetings Friends and Allies, 

It is with deep love and respect that I extend to you the following invitation and proposal in draft form, for your review, feedback, and improvement. 

It has been said to me that a good invitation should be both an attractor and a repellent. I have done my best to pour enough of myself into this, and set a high enough bar of commitment, to narrow down the field to those few brave souls who are committed, called, and impelled to this. 

I have also sprinkled in magic and play. This is going to be hard, and we deserve to have fund along the Way and not take our selves too seriously. 

In the context of the Lionsberg System of Governance and [[Decision Making]] process, this invitation also constitutes a concrete [[Proposal]] for review, improvement, and consent. 

Please provide your response by **Saturday April 1st**, and consider inviting the 2, 3, or 5 individuals you would most like to embark on this Quest with.
