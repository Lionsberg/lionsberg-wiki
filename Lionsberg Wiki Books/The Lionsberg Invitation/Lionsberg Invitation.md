# Lionsberg Invitation  

_(2023.03.26 Draft For Review and Improvement)_

Dear Friends and Allies, 

Greetings. I am writing to invite you to embark with me on the next phase of our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

We have set forth the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]]. We have built the foundational infrastructure, and confirmed the approximate pattern language. 

Succeeding and overcoming the challenges ahead will demand resources, sacrifice, and dedication. We now must forge enduring connections that unite and sustain us through the obstacles that lie ahead.

There is a famous myth that when Ernest Shackleton was organizing his historic Antarctic expedition, he placed the following ad in a London newspaper:

"_**Men Wanted** for hazardous **journey**, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success._"  

In this spirit, I extend this invitation and proposal to those few courageous individuals who know they were born for this moment in history, who resonate with the Spirit that impels us, and who are willing to sacrifice for the opportunity to strive together toward a [[Worthy Goal]]. This is your invitation to what I hope will become the adventure of a lifetime.

## Lionsberg 

Over the last five years, we have done our best to assemble an [[Ark]] and [[Way]] to get through this crucial moment in history. 

**It is called [[Lionsberg]], and this is your formal invitation to become its [[Co-Creators]].** 

## An Invitation 

**Welcome to Lionsberg** â€“ a system and place designed to serve and empower us to work and play together toward the **One Goal** that unites us **All** at this critical moment in history.

The purpose of Lionsberg is to forge a continuously improving platform, system and community to connect, serve, and empower the [[Force For Good]]. It's purpose and role is to be a servant and empowerer of All. 

## How It Works 

### I. Structure & Ecosystem

We have forged **a shared multi-generational legal and governance commons** *that no one owns*, which we will steward and cultivate together for the benefit of our future [[Selves]] and [[Future Generations]]. 

This unifying structure and commons allows for the entire cycle of emergence and co-creation to manifest in a safe, secure, and properly structured ecosystem that can benefit both us and the future generations we [[Pass The Baton]] to. 

### II. Benefits, Incentives and Value

*Because no one owns Lionsberg, every [[Participant]] has a stake in the [[Value]] we [[Co-Create]].* 

We will work together to continuously improve the benefits, incentives and value offered to Participants in each of the 5 Categories of Participation. 

### III. A Movement + Categories of Participation

We will do our best to fuel **A Global Movement** to awaken and inspire humanity. The Game will then divide the Field of Play into 5 basic Categories of Participation, each with its own [[Roles]], [[Rights]], and [[Responsibilities]]: 

1. Observers  
2. Participants  
3. Members  
4. Citizens  
5. Stewards  

Individuals who hear the [[Story of Lionsberg]], and who share their own Story, will be invited to advance towards ever [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] within the shared Movement and System. 

### IV. Purpose and Goals 

The [[Purpose]] of The Game is to work together to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

This [[Meta Goal]] integrates the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], informing the measurable quarterly [[Objectives]] we will stack up and align to advance together towards The Goal. 

[[Progress]] is made, and [[Value]] created, by the individual and local progress along the [[Critical Path]] towards local and global [[Objectives]] and [[Milestones]]. 

### V. Resourcing the Work

Nearly all [[Work]] required to advance towards our shared Goals and Values will be done through distributed, sovereign, autonomous [[Groups]].

To Resource the Work, the Lionsberg Community has established a 501(c)(3), as well as the legal and governance architecture for influencing future flows of political, investment, and public capital. See [[Provisional Structure]].  

Each Citizen Impact Group must remain autonomous, self-governing, and self-resourcing. Each eligible Group is free to forge a Fiscal Sponsorship agreement with the Lionsberg 501(c)(3), and to develop a Strategy, Plan, and Proposal for its work, that can then be resourced through philanthropic capital in support of the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

Over the medium term, we also intend to build a for-profit portfolio of businesses and real property to serve as the long term economic engine and endowment of the community. 

### VI. A Meaningful Tithe 

[[Success]] requires that The Game eternally regenerates and sustains itself ***from within***.

To accomplish this, each participant is invited to voluntary give back, out of the [[Value]] they freely receive from the Community and System, a [[Meaningful Monthly Tithe]] that will enable us to continuously improve the Quality and Reach of the Lionsberg Community and System. 

This ensures that all participants can make and keep the [[Minimum Commitments]] that sustain [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## Our Opening Contribution 

Over the several years, we have assembled a [[Meaningful Initial Contribution]] we offer as a starting point for our [[Quest]]. Our best assessment is that it would take at least 5 years and tens of millions of dollars to recreate: 

1. The Lionsberg Brand 
2. The Lionsberg 501(c)(3) Non-Profit 
3. The Lionsberg Hybrid [[Provisional Structure]]  
4. The [[Lionsberg System]]  
5. A [[New Vision and Plan]]    
6. A New Analysis  
7. A New Story  
8. A New Game   
9. A New Inspiration and Hope  
10. A New Community  
11. A New Structure  
12. A New Infrastructure  
13. A New Way  
14. A New Platform of Platforms 
15. The Capability to Forge Fiscal Sponsorships and Special Purpose Vehicles 
16. A small collection of inter-linked books - these are a [[Work In Progress]]: 
	1. [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]  
	2. [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]]  
	3. More to come soon 

## Co-Creation and Learning to Play Together
 
It is not yet possible to convey all that I have in mind, so we must collaborate and cooperate with [[Trust]] as we learn and grow together. 

I therefore propose that we drop all pretenses and enter a sacred environment of [[Continuous Learning And Improvement]], leading towards long term right relationship as [[Citizens]] of the [[New World]] we are co-creating.

*Let's move.* 

With Love, In Community,
