# The Lionsberg Invitation - An Invitation to an Epic Quest 

_(2023.03.26 Draft For Review and Improvement)_

Dear Friends and Allies, 

Greetings. I am writing to invite you to embark with me on the next phase of our epic [[Quest]] towards our ultimate shared Goal. 

Succeeding and overcoming the challenges ahead will demand resources, sacrifice, and dedication. We now must forge enduring connections that unite and sustain us through the obstacles that lie ahead.

There is a famous myth that when Ernest Shackleton was organizing his historic Antarctic expedition, he placed the following ad in a London newspaper:

"_**Men Wanted** for hazardous **journey**, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success._"  

In this spirit, I extend this invitation and proposal to those few courageous individuals who know they were born for this moment in history, who resonate with the Spirit that impels me, and who are willing to sacrifice for the opportunity to strive together toward a [[Worthy Goal]] that has not yet been achieved. This is your invitation to the adventure of a lifetime.

While I cannot guarantee success, my commitment to those pioneering trailblazers who embark on this noble Quest is that I will dedicate myself to helping you discover and become who you were uniquely created to be in service of One and All, as we progress together on this epic [[Quest]] toward [[The Goal]].

## The Quest 

On our [[Quest]] towards [[The Future We Seek]], our collective [[Force For Good]] stands at a crossroads. After journeying a long [[Way]], many of us are weary, nearing the end of our resources, confronting our own limitations, and unsure whether it is possible to [[Cross The Chasm]] the lies ahead. We occasionally glimpse the [[Land Of Promise]], abundant with resources and opportunities beyond our imagination, only for it to vanish like a mirage in the desert.  

## The Context 

Our [[External Context]] is spiraling towards chaos. Global alliances are shifting, banks are failing, inflation is surging, currencies are crumbling, diseases are spreading, tens of millions are displaced, superpowers are edging toward WWIII, artificial intelligence is emerging, corruption is being exposed, and the leaders and institutions we once relied on are paralyzed, blind, and unable to respond with courage and wisdom to the meta-crisis at hand.

In reaction to the unfolding chaos and their own pursuit of power, authoritarian forces are consolidating their [[Fascist]] collusion, eroding the hard-earned freedoms secured by our ancestors and drifting toward a tyrannical order that we do not want, did not choose, and will not consent to.  

## The 7 Year Period of Crisis and Opportunity 

Although we cannot be certain, we [[Hypothesize]] that we are now in a critical [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], the outcome of which will impact the lives of our children, grandchildren, and their descendants for generations to come.

To get to [[Where We Are Going]], we must carefully navigate the [[Challenges]] at hand and thread the needle between tyranny and chaos to discover and co-create the [[New World]]. 

## Citizen Heroes 

Against this stark backdrop, the light of Citizen Heroes on the frontlines of every battle to make our world a better place shines brilliantly. Yet divided and isolated, all of us who are striving towards The Goal lack the total resources, relationships, and transformational power required to genuinely address the [[Root Causes]] of the [[Meta Crisis]] and turn the tide.

## Lionsberg 

Over the last five years, we have sacrificed our growing wealth and position in the [[Old World]], journeying through the underworld and forging an [[Ark]] and a [[Way]] through this pivotal moment in history.

**It is called [[Lionsberg]], and this is your formal invitation to become its [[Co-Creators]] and heirs.** 

## An Invitation to The Great Game of Lionsberg 

**Welcome to Lionsberg** â€“ an immense system and place of epic, mythical, and magical proportions designed to serve and empower us to work and play together toward the **One Goal** that unites us **All** at this critical moment in history.

Lionsberg is a community of communities, a platform of platforms, a project of projects, a team of teams, a game of games, a business of businesses, a battle of battles, a campaign of campaigns, and a quest of quests. It is also the seed of a regenerated and flourishing [[New World]]. 

We have invented a Great Game so mysterious and powerful that as we [[Play]] it together, we and the world actually and measurably will transform. 

## How It Works 

### I. Structure & Ecosystem

The Game exists within the Context of **a shared multi-generational legal and governance commons** *that no one owns*, which we steward and cultivate together for the benefit of our future [[Selves]] and [[Future Generations]]. 

As a [[Participant]], and eventually a Member and Citizen, you will become a co-creator and co-steward of a Movement, a Community, a Vision, a System, a Structure, and a Plan bigger than us all. 

This unifying structure and commons allows for the entire cycle of emergence and co-creation to manifest in a safe, secure, and properly structured ecosystem that can benefit both us and the future generations we [[Pass The Baton]] to. 

### II. Benefits, Incentives and Value

*Because no one owns Lionsberg, every [[Participant]] has a stake in the [[Value]] we [[Co-Create]] in accordance with The Rules of The Game.* 

We will work together to continuously improve the benefits, incentives and value offered to Participants in each of the 5 Categories of Participation. 

### III. A Movement + Categories of Participation

We will do our best to fuel **A Global Movement** to awaken and inspire humanity. The Game will then divide the Field of Play into 5 basic Categories of Participation, each with its own [[Roles]], [[Rights]], and [[Responsibilities]]: 

1. Observers  
2. Participants  
3. Members  
4. Citizens  
5. Stewards  

Additionally, we have established three basic categories of non-participation: 

1. The unaware  
2. The opposed  

Individuals who hear the [[Story of Lionsberg]], and who share their own Story, will be invited to invited to advance towards ever [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] within the System. 

### IV. Purpose and Goals 

The [[Purpose]] of The Game is to work together accomplish [[The Goal]], which is to bring Heaven to Earth. 

This Ultimate Goal integrates a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], informing the measurable quarterly [[Objectives]] we will stack up and align to advance together towards The Goal. 

[[Progress]] is made, and [[Value]] created, by the individual and local progress along the [[Critical Path]] towards local and global [[Objectives]] and [[Milestones]]. 

### V. Resourcing the Work

Nearly all [[Work]] required to advance towards our shared Goals and Values will be done through distributed, sovereign, autonomous [[Groups]].

To Resource the Work, the Lionsberg Community has established a 501(c)(3), as well as the legal and governance architecture for influencing future flows of political, investment, and public capital. 

For this phase, we believe the [[Wise Right]] way to resource the next steps is entirely through philanthropic and participant contributions, to ensure complete freedom to advance together towards The Goal without compromise. 

Each Citizen Impact Group must remain autonomous, self-governing, and self-resourcing. Each eligible Group is free to forge a Fiscal Sponsorship agreement with the Lionsberg 501(c)(3), and to develop a Strategy, Plan, and Proposal for its work, that can then be resourced through philanthropic capital in support the Vision, Mission, and Values of Lionsberg and as set forth in the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

### VI. The Tithe 

[[Success]] requires that The Game eternally regenerates and sustains itself ***from within***.

To accomplish this, each participant is expected to voluntary and honestly give back, out of the [[Value]] they freely receive from The Game, a [[Meaningful Monthly Tithe]] that will enable us to continuously improve the Quality and Reach of The Game. 

For this initial stage, the minimum tithe is 1/10th of your Time, Attention, and the Flow of Value you receive from The Game. This ensures that all participants can make and keep the [[Minimum Commitments]] that sustain [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## Starting Gifts 

Over the years, I have assembled an opening collection of gifts that I freely offer you as a starting point for your [[Quest]]:

12. The Gift of a New Love 
13. The Gift of Fiscal Sponsorships and Special Purpose Vehicles 
14. The Gift of a New Me, in service of a New You, for whatever that might be worth  
15. A small collection of inter-linked books - these are a [[Work In Progress]]: 
	1. [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]  
	2. [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]]   
	3. [[The Lionsberg Book of Meditations]]  
	4. [[The Book of Lionsberg]]  

## Co-Creation and Learning to Play Together

It is not yet possible to convey all that I have in mind, so we must collaborate and cooperate with [[Trust]] as we learn and grow together. 

I therefore propose that we drop all pretenses of knowing or capability, and enter a sacred environment of [[Continuous Learning And Improvement]], leading towards long term [[Covenant Relationship]] as [[Citizens]] of the [[New World]] we are co-creating. 

## The Next 5 Steps 

The Next 5 Steps Are As Follows: 

1. Determine if [[Jordan]] and the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]] are within your [[Range of Tolerance]]:   
	1. Determine if the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]] is within your [[Range of Tolerance]].   
	2. Determine if the [[New Vision and Plan]] are within your [[Range of Tolerance]].  
	3. Determine if [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]] is within your [[Range of Tolerance]].   
	4. Determine if Jordan is *personally* within your [[Range of Tolerance]]. Lionsberg *must* grow into a mythical system and structure far beyond Jordan, however you will not like Lionsberg if you don't like its source, or are scared by the risks Jordan must take. 
2. Complete and the return the [[Lionsberg Subscription Agreement]].  
3. **Help spread awareness, recruit members, and gather resources in April 2023**. 
4. May 1st 2023: Provided that adequate [[Opening Resources]] have been gathered for stewardship by the [[Lionsberg System]], the [[Core Enterprise]] and [[Mission Control]] will be established and begin onboarding prior to our collective departure on the [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]. 
5. In May, every Participant will be invited into a comprehensive and ongoing Orientation, Integration and Training process to help ensure that each of us, and all of us, avoid failure and achieve success on our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]].  

## Onwards Towards The Goal! 

It has been a deep honor getting to know you over the years. Regardless of how you would like to participate, I am grateful for the Time and Attention you have invested in our relationship, and in stewarding the emergence towards this crucial moment. 

If you choose not to embark with us as we set sail on this [[Quest]], we will see less of one another, but I will hold you in my heart, wish you my best, and do my best to send notes and maps back from afar, and build infrastructure along the [[Way]] to benefit you should you choose to join [[The Movement]] FROM the [[Old World]] TO the [[New World]] in the future. 

It would be a deep honor to progress forward with you. The world needs you. The world needs us. 

*Let's move.* 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J
