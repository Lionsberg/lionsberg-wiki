# The Lionsberg Invitation - An Invitation to an Epic Quest 

_(2023.03.26 Draft For Review and Improvement)_

Dear Friends and Allies, 

Greetings. I am writing to invite you to embark with me on the next phase of our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

Succeeding and overcoming the challenges ahead will demand resources, sacrifice, and dedication. We now must forge enduring connections that unite and sustain us through the obstacles that lie ahead.

There is a famous myth that when Ernest Shackleton was organizing his historic Antarctic expedition, he placed the following ad in a London newspaper:

"_**Men Wanted** for hazardous **journey**, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful, honor and recognition in case of success._"  

In this spirit, I extend this invitation and proposal to those few courageous individuals who know they were born for this moment in history, who resonate with the Spirit that impels us, and who are willing to sacrifice for the opportunity to strive together toward a [[Worthy Goal]] that has not yet been achieved. This is your invitation to what I hope will become the adventure of a lifetime.

## Lionsberg 

Over the last five years, we have done our best to assemble an [[Ark]] and [[Way]] to get through this crucial moment in history. 

**It is called [[Lionsberg]], and this is your formal invitation to become its [[Co-Creators]].** 

## An Invitation 

**Welcome to Lionsberg** â€“ a system and place designed to serve and empower us to work and play together toward the **One Goal** that unites us **All** at this critical moment in history.

The purpose of Lionsberg is to forge a platform, system and community to connect, serve, and empower the [[Force For Good]]. It is designed as a servant of All. 

## How It Works 

### I. Structure & Ecosystem

We have forged **a shared multi-generational legal and governance commons** *that no one owns*, which we will steward and cultivate together for the benefit of our future [[Selves]] and [[Future Generations]]. 

This unifying structure and commons allows for the entire cycle of emergence and co-creation to manifest in a safe, secure, and properly structured ecosystem that can benefit both us and the future generations we [[Pass The Baton]] to. 

### II. Benefits, Incentives and Value

*Because no one owns Lionsberg, every [[Participant]] has a stake in the [[Value]] we [[Co-Create]] in accordance with The Rules of The Game.* 

We will work together to continuously improve the benefits, incentives and value offered to Participants in each of the 5 Categories of Participation. 

### III. A Movement + Categories of Participation

We will do our best to fuel **A Global Movement** to awaken and inspire humanity. The Game will then divide the Field of Play into 5 basic Categories of Participation, each with its own [[Roles]], [[Rights]], and [[Responsibilities]]: 

1. Observers  
2. Participants  
3. Members  
4. Citizens  
5. Stewards  

Additionally, we have established two basic categories of non-participation: 

1. The unaware  
2. The opposed  

Individuals who hear the [[Story of Lionsberg]], and who share their own Story, will be invited to advance towards ever [[More Meaningful Participation, Responsibility, and Stewardship]] within the shared Movement and System. 

### IV. Purpose and Goals 

The [[Purpose]] of The Game is to work together to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

This Ultimate Goal integrates a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]], informing the measurable quarterly [[Objectives]] we will stack up and align to advance together towards The Goal. 

[[Progress]] is made, and [[Value]] created, by the individual and local progress along the [[Critical Path]] towards local and global [[Objectives]] and [[Milestones]]. 

### V. Resourcing the Work

Nearly all [[Work]] required to advance towards our shared Goals and Values will be done through distributed, sovereign, autonomous [[Groups]].

To Resource the Work, the Lionsberg Community has established a 501(c)(3), as well as the legal and governance architecture for influencing future flows of political, investment, and public capital. 

For this phase, we believe the [[Wise Right]] way to resource the next steps is entirely through philanthropic and participant contributions, to ensure complete freedom to advance together towards The Goal without compromise or expectations of financial return. 

Each Citizen Impact Group must remain autonomous, self-governing, and self-resourcing. Each eligible Group is free to forge a Fiscal Sponsorship agreement with the Lionsberg 501(c)(3), and to develop a Strategy, Plan, and Proposal for its work, that can then be resourced through philanthropic capital in support of the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

### VI. The Tithe 

[[Success]] requires that The Game eternally regenerates and sustains itself ***from within***.

To accomplish this, each participant is expected to voluntary and honestly give back, out of the [[Value]] they freely receive from The Game, a [[Meaningful Monthly Tithe]] that will enable us to continuously improve the Quality and Reach of The Game. 

This ensures that all participants can make and keep the [[Minimum Commitments]] that sustain [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## Starting Gifts 

Over the years, I have assembled an opening collection of gifts that I freely offer you as a starting point for your [[Quest]]:

3. The Gift of a New Story

6. The Gift of a New Community  
7. The Gift of a New Structure  
8. The Gift of a New Infrastructure  
9. The Gift of a New System and Process  
10. The Gift of a New Way  
11. The Gift of a New Platform of Platforms 
12. The Gift of Fiscal Sponsorships and Special Purpose Vehicles 
13. A small collection of inter-linked books - these are a [[Work In Progress]]: 
	1. [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]]  
	2. [[A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation]]  
	3. More to come soon 


## Co-Creation and Learning to Play Together
 
It is not yet possible to convey all that I have in mind, so we must collaborate and cooperate with [[Trust]] as we learn and grow together. 

I therefore propose that we drop all pretenses of knowing or capability, and enter a sacred environment of [[Continuous Learning And Improvement]], leading towards long term right relationship as [[Citizens]] of the [[New World]] we are co-creating.

It would be a deep honor to progress forward with you. The world needs you. The world needs us. 

*Let's move.* 

With Love, In Community, 

~ J
