# 1.6 A Metaphor 

Let us imagine that we were invited to participate in helping co-create a building or universe, and we only had one hour a day to help. 

(This might actually be a fitting metaphor if [[One]] is at least as conscious and intelligent as we are, and has something in [[Mind]] for us to do together.)

Before we rushed into action, we would need to take time to understand the [[Designer's Intent]]. 

The first role of every individual and team on a building project is to review the plans and specifications, and understand the [[Designer's Intent]].  

Once we understood the overarching and uniting Intention / Vision / Goal (Step One)... 

Step Two would be to analyze the existing forces and conditions and understand what presently was. 

Our first two steps would orient us to [[The Gap]] between [[What Is]] and [[What Ought To Be]]; [[The Gap]] between the current [[State of Being]], and the Better and Higher [[State of Being]] that the Designer Intends for the [[Domain to be Transformed]].  

Understanding Point A [[What Is]] / [[Where We Are]], and Point B [[What Ought To Be]] / [[Where We Are Going]], we could then engage with the other builders (Step 3), develop a shared [[Plan of Action]] (Step 4), and then [[Enact]] our Plan with a small Team, understanding that plans never survive first contact with [[Reality]] and need to Continuously Learn and Improve. 

If we did not yet understand the [[Designer's Intent]] or the [[Plan of Action]], it would be far more helpful for us to [[Do Nothing]], than to take some "helpful" action that would likely need to be removed and redone. 

Therefore until we understood the [[Designer's Intent]] and the [[Existing Forces and Conditions]], our Best and Highest role would be to sit quietly, study, discern, and learn.
