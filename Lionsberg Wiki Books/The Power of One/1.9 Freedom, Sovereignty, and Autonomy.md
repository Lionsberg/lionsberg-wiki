# 1.9 Freedom, Sovereignty, and Autonomy

It does not need to be said, but We will repeat it anyway: 

You are a Sovereign, Autonomous, [[Conscious Agent]].  

[[You Are The First Agent]]. 

You are [[Free]]. You have [[Free Will]]. 

[[Out Here]], [[Beyond The Boundary]], there are no [[Employee Consumer Slaves]]. There are no classes. There is no ruling or religious elite to "subordinate your spiritual and intellectual will" to. [[There Is No Them]]. 

It is your right and responsibility to do the [[Wise Right Thing]], at the right time, for the right reasons, to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

[[The Goal]] is the [[Creator's Intent]]. The Goal is [[Heaven On Earth]]. 

You have chosen to take the challenge of spending One Hour a Day to [[Being|Be]] and [[Doing|Do]] from the Highest Place that you can relate to, and in that there is absolute Freedom. 

To begin, simply commit to spending One Hour a day to transform your life and your world. 

Simply commit to spending One Hour a day in service to [[ONE]] and [[All]].  

Spend the 1st 15 minute Period of Action in [[Prayer]] and [[Meditation]] to bring your [[Self]] into [[Coherence]] with the [[ONE]]; into [[Alignment]] with the [[Generative Source]] of the Universe; into [[Harmony]] with the [[Fundamental Tone]]; into a State of [[Flow]]. 

Then, with your remaining three periods of Time, remain in [[Flow]] and do what the Spirit impels you to do.
