# 1.9 Freedom, Sovereignty, and Autonomy

It does not need to be said, but we will repeat it anyway: 

You are a Sovereign, Free, Autonomous Conscious Agent. 

It is your right and responsibility to do the [[Wise Right Thing]], at the right time, for the right reasons, to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

You have chosen to take the challenge of spending One Hour a Day to [[Being|Be]] and [[Doing|Do]] from the Highest Place that you can relate to, and in that there is absolute Freedom. 

To begin The Game, commit to spending One Hour a day to transform your life and your world. 

Spend the 1st 15 minute Period of Action in prayer, meditation, and alignment. Then, with your remaining three periods of Time, do what the Spirit impels you to do. 

Hashtag Lionsberg and The Power of One, and share your Stories of Transformation.
