# The Power of One

By definition, [[One]] is the most Powerful thing in the universe. 

It generates and orders the total set of All activity, across All [[Time]] and [[Space]], and is the [[One]] Thing that has the [[Power]] to influence [[All]] things. 

So what might happen if we spent at least **One Hour a day**, [[Doing Our Best]] to tap into and Live out from the [[One]] [[Deepest]] and Highest Thing we could possibly relate to? 

[[The Power of One]] is a social experiment to try it, find out, and report the results. 

Our [[Hypothesis]] is that if enough people engaged in the experiment, an entirely [[New World]] would manifest.  

We'll start small, and see how it affects our own lives in our own [[Time]] and [[Space]].
