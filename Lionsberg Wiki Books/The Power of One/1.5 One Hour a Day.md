# 1.5 One Hour a Day

If we were going to spend One Hour a Day [[Doing Our Best]] to tap into, rightly relate to, and live out from That Which is Creating and Sustaining our [[Life]], our [[Consciousness]], and our Universe... 

...how might we go about doing that? 

The first step is to separate, temporarily, the notions of [[Being]] and [[Doing]]. 

[[Being]] relates to the pure essence of existence. "I Amness". Existence. Awareness. Pure Consciousness. Presence. The Universal. The Eternal. The Now. 

[[Doing]] relates to engaging in [[Activity]] or [[Work]] in [[Space]] and [[Time]]. 

Before we can possibly know how to **Do** from the Highest Place, we must understand how to relate to and **Be** with the Highest Place and the Highest [[One]]. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] involves dividing up our perceived One Hour of [[Time]] into 15 minute units of Time, or [[Periods of Action]].  

Now that we have an abundance of Four 15 Minute Periods of Action, how might we deploy them in the Highest and Best Way?
