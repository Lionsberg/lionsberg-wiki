# 1.8 Aligning Vision, Intention, and Analysis

Without a shared overarching and uniting Vision, Intention, and Goal, people, systems and societies perish and eventually [[Collapse]]. 

It is impossible to be an integrated Being without an overarching and uniting Purpose and Goal. 

When we zoom out and look at the entire human species, and its place within the [[Living System]], it becomes clear that there is only [[One Thing]] big enough to unite us [[All]]. 

What unites [[All Creation]] is its [[Generative Source]]. 

Out of [[One]], [[The Diverse Many]]. Out of [[The Diverse Many]], [[One]]. 

If you investigate any [[Apparent Object]] within the [[Living System]] carefully enough, eventually you will rediscover the [[One]] creating and sustaining it.

If you investigate the [[One]] carefully enough, eventually you will discover that It has a [[Mind]], [[Will]], and [[Intention]] no less sophisticated than the [[Apparently Individuated Consciousness]] perceiving It. 

The Universe It is Creating is [[Intelligible]]. It has a [[Logos]]. 

The [[Logos]] of the Universe is the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. 

The [[Logos]] of the Universe is what [[Informs]] the [[Divine Blueprints]]. 

Therefore, our first 15 minute [[Periods of Action|Period of Action]] or [[Units of Time|Unit of Time]] should be devoted to aligning our individuated Vision, Intention, and Analysis with the Vision, Intention, and Analysis of the [[One]]. 

[[Prayer]], [[Meditation]], and [[Coherence]] are what make co-operating as One Body possible.
