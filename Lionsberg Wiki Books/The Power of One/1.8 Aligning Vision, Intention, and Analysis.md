# 1.8 Aligning Vision, Intention, and Analysis
Without a shared overarching and uniting Vision, Intention, and Goal, people and societies perish. 

It is impossible to be an integrated Being without an overarching and uniting Purpose and Goal. 

When we zoom out and look at the entire human species, and its place within the [[Living System]], it becomes clear that there is only [[One Thing]] big enough to unite us [[All]]. 

It is what the [[One]] has in [[Mind]]. It is the [[Designer's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]]. 

Therefore, our first 15 minute [[Periods of Action|Period of Action]] or [[Units of Time|Unit of Time]] should be devoted to aligning our Vision, Intention, and Analysis with the Vision, Intention, and Analysis of the [[One]].
