Imagine all 8 billion of us human beings as workers on a single worksite... 

Imagine if we truly all understood the Best and Highest Vision, Intention, and Goal for All and aligned our Selves to it...  

Imagine if we truly all understood the [[Existing Forces and Conditions]], and why our world was manifesting the way it was...

Imagine if we truly all understood the [[System Wide Master Plan]] to [[Cross The Chasm]] between [[Where We Are]] and [[Where We Are Going]]...  

Imagine if we truly all understood our unique and important role to play... 

Imagine if we had the proper training, development, tools and resources at our disposal to execute the [[Plan of Action]] with clarity and focus. 

And imagine if we [[Help One Another|Helped One Another]] [[Continuous Improvement|Continuously Improve]] and [[Get A Little Better Every Day]]. 

How high could we go? 

Would it not be possible to co-create, in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]], anything that the Designer had in [[Mind]]?
