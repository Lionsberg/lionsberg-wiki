# 1.7 Application

Imagine all 8 or 9 billion of us human beings as workers on a single worksite... 

...[[Worksite Earth]]. 

Imagine if we truly all understood the Best and Highest Vision, Intention, and Goal for All and aligned our Selves to it...  

...the [[Creator's Intent]]. 

Imagine if we truly all understood the [[Existing Forces and Conditions]], and why our world was manifesting the way it was... 

Imagine if we truly all understood the [[System Wide Master Plan]] to [[Cross The Chasm]] between [[Where We Are]] and [[Where We Are Going]]...  

Imagine if we truly all understood our unique and important role to play... 

Imagine if we had the proper training, development, tools and resources at our disposal to execute the [[Plan of Action]] with clarity and focus. 

And imagine if we [[Help One Another|Helped One Another]] [[Continuous Improvement|Continuously Improve]] and become [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

How high could we go? What would be the [[Upper Limit]] of our co-creative [[Potential]] if we were [[United As One]]?  

Would it not be possible to co-create, in partnership with [[ONE]] and [[All]], anything that the Co-Creators had in [[Mind]]?
