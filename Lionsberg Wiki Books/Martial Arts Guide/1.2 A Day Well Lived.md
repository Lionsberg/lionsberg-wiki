# 1.2 A Day Well Lived

Yes you will learn how to fight well, but it is far more crucial that you learn how to **be** well, and how to become well. 

This is a Guide on Martial Arts. 

Yet far more so, it is a Guide pointing you towards a Way of Being in harmony and [[Right Relationship]] with [[One]] and [[All]], through which you can discover and progressively [[Realize]] what is within you, by helping [[All]] others do the same. 

The heart of this [[Way]] is to elevate and transform the entirely of your being towards towards its unique [[Potential]], so that you can help [[All]] others do the same. 

In order to do that, we are going to have to [[Work]] together. We are going to have to [[Be]] together. We are going to have to [[Become]] together. We are going to have to advance towards Unity with One and One Another through [[Love]]. 

You will become a force to be reckoned with individually, but in order to succeed we will need to become One integrated [[Force For Good]], a superorganism to be reckoned with collectively, through the reality of how We exist Together through each moment.
