# 1.9 Laying Down Your Life

We can tell you right up front - the end of this [[Way]] results being willing, able and morally obligated to lay down your own life in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Do not embark on this [[Way]] unless you are willing to become the kind of being who lays down their own life in service of [[All]] [[Life]]. 

There is an interesting twist to the plot this time around though. If 8 billion of us became _willing_ to lay down our lives in service of [[All]], then we would not have to, and we could instead flourish together in paradise.

*It is the willingness to sacrifice that prevents the necessity of sacrifice.*
