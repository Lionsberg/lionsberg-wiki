# 4.0 Total Integrated Wellbeing and Development 

The true [[Way]] is a life-long journey of progressively discovering and [[Realize|Realizing]] your best and highest [[Potential]], by helping [[All]] others do the same. 

To discover and achieve our potential, we must achieve our potential with our whole being. If we leave any part behind, it affects the others. We therefore need to look at at least 3 parts of our being, as well as how that composite being interacts with the fields that permeate it.

## The Spiritual Element

The true [[Way]] is integrated and led by [[Spirit]]. The [[Metaphysical]] leads, and the [[Physical]] follows.  

## The Intellectual Element

The [[Way]] elevates, encompasses, and integrates the [[Mind]] with the body and [[Spirit]]. 

## The Physical Element

The [[Way]] elevates and integrates our whole physical being. Our physical being is a complex nested system of systems permeated and sustained by both higher order systems it is a part of, and lower order systems that are a part of it.
