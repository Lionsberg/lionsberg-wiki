# 0.7 Your Story

Yet you are not here because of Our story. You are here because of [[Your Story]]. 

And We are here to help you across [[The Chasm]] that lies between you and your [[Destiny]].  

For opening guidance on how to articulate and align [[Your Story]], and another take on the [[Daily Practice]] that you will be crucial to your success, visit [[The Power of Today]]. It is a short read, so we would recommend that you dive into it to get a broader and more beneficial context that leads [[Your Story]] into a Team, a Community, and a [[Daily Practice]].
