# 1.5 Elevating and Transforming the Entire Being

There is only one [[Living System]]. There is only one Ultimate Reality. There is only one [[Meta Goal]]. There is only [[One]]. 

There is only one You. 

Your purpose is to discover and become the fullness of what you were uniquely created to be, so that [[The Goal]] can in-break and become [[Reality]] through You, through Us, for the benefit of [[All]]. 

The [[Way]] focuses on elevating and transforming the entire being, spiritually, intellectually, and physically, into a higher order functional unity capable of wise right action to meet the needs and solve the problems inherent in whatever [[Time]] and [[Space]] We are present in. 

It focuses on elevating and transforming each one into a conduit of ever-increasing capacity, through which the Spirit can flow through Us into every situation We encounter. 

Recognizing that none of Us cannot do that alone, it then focuses on forging, out of many elevating and transforming individuals, ONE [[Higher Order Functional Unity]], or community,  capable of wise right action to meet the needs and solve the problems inherent in [[All]] communities of life as [[All]] things advance towards the Goal. 

The coherence and integrity of the [[Whole]] starts with and depends upon the coherence and integrity of each and every individual. 

The coherence and integrity of each and every individual begins with you. With Us. 

Elevate and transform your entire being, as if the eternal destiny of [[All]] depended upon it.
