# 1.18 All Things Helping One Another Rise

If we [[Love]] something, we desire for it to develop into the fullness of its unique [[Potential]] and flourish in [[Harmony]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

If we [[Love]] [[All]], then we desire for [[All]] to develop into the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] and flourish in [[Harmony]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

If [[All]] Loved [[All]], then [[All]] would desire for [[All]] to develop into the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish in [[Harmony]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]]. 

If [[All]] desired to elevate and transform [[All]], then [[All]] things would [[Help One Another]] rise. 

This is the [[Way]] towards the [[Goal]]. 

This is the simple standard of Goodness. 

The single unifying principle is [[ONE]], and [[ONE]] is [[Love]].
