# 1.19 Why Philosophy? 

Why so much philosophy? Who so much talk about the [[Old]], the [[New]], the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]], and the Spirit in which one must progress out beyond [[The Boundary]] and across [[The Chasm]] that separates [[Where We Are]] from [[Where We Are Going]]? 

It is because we are going to equip you with great [[Power]], and the philosophy that directs that [[Power]] towards a very specific [[Aim]] will mean the difference between Life and Death for you and for many. 

Philosophy, the Love of the Mind and Wisdom of God, must lead, and everything else must follow and harmonize with that [[One]] Spirit. 

If those we are equipping and empowering are divided against themselves, they mutual destruction is assured, and they will drag [[All]] down towards the pit with them.
