# 0.6 Our Story

We suppose that you may be interested in the story of how We came to be Keeper of these mysteries.

This incarnation has swept Us through a very unusual series of extraordinary experiences in preparation for [[The War]]. 

It is a series of events that has caused Us to realize Our sacred obligation to integrate and uplift the various realms of Wisdom and Knowledge that have been passed on to Us, and to pass them on to [[All]] in a Way that will operationalize [[Our Collective Inheritance]], transforming it into a collectively embodied [[Way of Being]]. 

We are merely conduits of [[Logos]], of thousands of years of Wisdom and Knowledge, distilled by Masters in a variety of domains, who descended to share it with Us. 

When we found ourselves [[Thrown]] into the present transition between ages, We searched and searched and could not rediscover the integrated System We were expecting to have been carried on. 

Somehow it had been buried. Thousands of years ago. 

So We spent lifetimes searching it back out and reassembling it. 

It is still a major work in progress. It will eternally remain so. 
This is a Living Guide to a Living Way. 

We are taking the risks of embarrassing Our Selves by writing it down into form now, as a rough draft at the outset, in case its implementation and operationalization again costs Us Our lives. 

Were that to be the case, it is Our hope that some brave souls may carry it forward, and do their best to practice it, protect it, preserve it, and equip as many others as possible with its [[Power]] and [[Hope]]. 

Our qualifications are not noteworthy. We could be anyone from anywhere. 

We were born on December 18, 1984, knowing that We were here **for this**.  

Advancing towards [[The War]] required that We work as hard as We could to become as generally competent as possible in the arts and sciences that would be required to prevail. 

Along the Way We earned bachelors degrees and masters degrees in business, built hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure and superstructure for humanity, earned recognition from the Senate and Assembly of the 5th largest economy in the world, and were awarded three black belt degrees and other certificates in the traditional art of Inyo Ryu Karate while studying Jiu Jitsu, Krav Maga, other arts, and their synthesis into Way. 

Around 2017, as We laid the foundations for [[The War]] and advanced along the [[Critical Path]], We accelerated work with Our primary martial arts teacher, one of two 7th degree black belts in the world in Inyo Ryu who had studied and taught a variety of arts over 50+ years, to transcend all named arts and structures while recreating a successor system that wove the Golden Threads of Wisdom present in each stream back into the nameless and eternal Way. 

As he prepared for his passing in 2021, We were asked to take up the mantle of successorship. 

Under full scale attack by the Forces of Darkness since 2019, it took until 2024 for Us to be fully stripped of Our Old Life to the point it could be laid down in order to rise again. 

As Spring 2025 dawned, it was Time to attempt to rise. 

By carefully avoiding any schools or teachers that required vows or secrecy, and by taking the risk to leave behind the credibility in Old systems that come with multiple degrees in various areas, and by risking everything to co-create something New, and by enduring the abuse, rejection and death of Old lives in order to rise into something entirely New, we have regained, at tremendous cost, the FREEDOM AND LIBERTY that comes with transcending the [[Old]] structures and paradigms, and ascending back towards direct [[Right Relationship]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]], and the Power and Authority that comes therewith. 

As We understand it, We have until the end of 2026 to forget [[The First Three Percent]] into the army of leadership, light, and love required to guide and protect humanity through **what comes next.**

Like it or not, We were born into a world at war. 

But present upon Earth is the Force for Good that was created uniquely for this moment, and uniquely for this battle. 

Like Us, have you not known and felt called up into it from your youth? Can you not feeling it calling you now? Deep within Us All, The Spirit is rising.
