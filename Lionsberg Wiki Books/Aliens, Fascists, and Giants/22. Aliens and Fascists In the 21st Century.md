# 22. Aliens and Fascists In the 20th and 21st Century

Let's cut straight to the chase. We are not alone here on Earth, and advanced extraterrestrial life forms, some malevolent, are vying for influence and control over our lives and our world. 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so let's begin stacking up some evidence that can be analyzed and progressively proved or disproved. 

When we see one piece of evidence, it may be an anomaly. When we see two pieces of evidence, we should perhaps really start paying attention. When we see three pieces of evidence, it becomes very likely that it is not a mere coincidence. When thousands of witnesses present thousands of pieces of evidence that triangulate to one another, the probability that there is not a real underlying phenomena asymptotically approaches zero. 

I am going to very quickly lay out a Story, which We can work together to improve. The United States government is legally obligated to disclose what it knows by October 2024, which at present it appears to be making every effort to avoid. 

This story is designed to serve as a baseline BS detector. What the US Government discloses should be far more comprehensive than what follows, and explain at least all of the following incredible story. 

Try to follow the names and patterns, over time we can work together to link everything up in the Wiki to make the picture more clear. 

Perhaps the approximate story of extraterrestrial and fascist involvement in the late 1800s and 2000s is something like: 

## Egyptian Hieroglyphics

People have long been interested in identifying the true builders of the Pyramids, who are likely related to Beings From Beyond. 

Perhaps specifically relating to the Orion Nebula. 

The last chapter discussed this. 

Interest and efforts accelerate in the early 1900s. 

## Waking Up in the Late 1800s

It bears repeating... 

After the construction of the ancient wonders that each civilization that has them reports were built by "the gods"...

...Sources tell us that ~2,500 years ago the benevolent extraterrestrial forces pull out from the Earth... 

...Over a 400 year period there is an obvious conspiracy to conceal the knowledge and endarken humanity... 

...The great Republics fall, the Empires rise, and for 2,000 years society becomes shrouded in Darkness and Deceit, with all the High Science Technology concealed deep behind the religious priesthood set up in the Image of the new Roman Empire. 

...In 1,500 We manage to rediscover the cipher, and thereby begin to reclaim some basic computational proficiency that begins to unveil the Deceit... 

...We begin to protest a bit and nail theses to the wall, but we are ostracized, assassinated, and burnt at the stake...

...Then, strangely, and all of a sudden... in the 1880s and 1890s, and early 1900s...

...Over a 20 or 30 period, after millennia in Darkness, a couple pockets of human beings in America and Germany / Austria / Hungary and beyond all of a sudden understand electricity, electromagnetism, quantum physics, antigravitation, x-rays, alternative propulsion systems, start taking flight in giant dirigibles, etc...

...and then by the 1920s and 1930s thousands of human beings all over the planet suddenly decide to risk everything they have to figure out how to build advanced space vehicles and get off the Earth, and out into the cosmos. 

Further, many these individuals directly and forthrightly purport to be interfacing with extraterrestrial technologies and influence. 

What if our ancestors and these thousands of modern people with direct firsthand experience are telling the Truth?

## The Jersey Devil Encounters (1735–Present)

**Summary:**  
The Jersey Devil is one of the most enduring cryptid legends in American folklore, with sightings spanning from the 18th century to the present day. Often described as a kangaroo-like creature with leathery wings, hooves, and a terrifying scream, it is said to haunt the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey. Originating from local folklore in 1735, the legend gained national attention during the "Jersey Devil Panic" of 1909, when hundreds of alleged sightings and encounters were reported.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Jersey Devil blends mythology, cultural history, and cryptozoology, offering a unique lens into human perception of the unexplained. Its long history of sightings and cultural impact makes it one of the most famous cryptid cases, with implications for folklore studies and the psychology of fear.

See [[The Jersey Devil Encounters (1735–Present)]]  
# The Marfa Lights (Texas, 1880s–Present)

**Summary:**  
The Marfa Lights are an enduring and enigmatic phenomenon observed near Marfa, Texas, since at least the 1880s. These mysterious orbs of light, often described as floating, splitting, or darting across the horizon, have puzzled locals, tourists, and scientists alike. Despite numerous investigations, including studies by scientists and skeptics, the lights remain unexplained, fueling intrigue and speculation ranging from natural atmospheric phenomena to UFO activity.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Marfa Lights exemplify how long-standing, recurring phenomena can defy scientific explanation, challenging our understanding of natural and potentially supernatural forces. Their cultural and scientific significance draws parallels to other light anomalies worldwide, including the Hessdalen Lights, highlighting global patterns of unexplained phenomena.

See [[The Marfa Lights (Texas, 1880s–Present)]]  
## In Germany, in the Late 1800s

The MTM-622 Unconventional Propulsion Schemes carried by Klemperer ([[Dr. Klemperer’s Unconventional Propulsion Schemes]]), who you will meet later in the story, reveal apparent extraterrestrial involvement in aeronautical and space-faring activities in Germany back to 1873 and 1895, and in the United States back to the 1910s. 
## Europe - 1890s

"In the 1890s, European farmers and engineers mortgaged their houses and conducted fieldwork on their own time, in order to come up with similar theories." - William Tompkins  

## The Great Airship Mystery (1896–1897)

**Summary:**  
The Great Airship Mystery refers to a wave of UFO sightings reported across the United States from late 1896 to mid-1897. Witnesses described seeing cigar-shaped or dirigible-like flying crafts equipped with bright lights, propellers, and advanced machinery, often at night. These airships were claimed to perform remarkable maneuvers and exhibited technological features far beyond what was publicly known at the time. The sightings, documented in newspapers and personal accounts, remain one of the earliest mass UFO phenomena in modern history.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Great Airship Mystery is a pivotal case in UFO history, predating powered human flight and suggesting the presence of advanced aerial technology. The consistency of descriptions, wide geographic spread, and public interest make it an essential chapter in the exploration of unidentified aerial phenomena.

See [[The Great Airship Mystery (1896–1897)]]  
## 1900  - Max Planck and the Planck Scale 

Max Planck was a German theoretical physicist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his significant breakthroughs in the early 1900s, including his discovery / revelation of [[Energy Quanta]] and his origination of Quantum Theory, which revolutionized modern human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. 
## 1900 - Count Zeppelin and the First Airship

After completing and retiring from a career in the German military, at age 52 Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin "first becomes interested" in technology and innovations, and "rapidly becomes a visionary of his time". 

Under his influence, the city of Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance becomes a center of advanced technology. 

On July 2, 1900, the LZ 1, the first Zeppelin airship, was launched. 

Zeppelin initiated a number of company foundations to develop the necessary technologies and supply chains that did not yet exist. 

Successor companies and foundations still exist in Friedrichshafen to this day. 

## The Tunguska Event (1908)

**Summary:**  
The Tunguska Event was a massive explosion that occurred on June 30, 1908, in a remote area near the Tunguska River in Siberia, Russia. The blast leveled over 800 square miles of forest, flattening an estimated 80 million trees and producing shockwaves felt thousands of miles away. Despite its immense scale, no impact crater was found, fueling speculation about its cause. Proposed explanations range from a meteoroid or comet explosion to exotic theories involving antimatter, black holes, or extraterrestrial activity.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Tunguska Event remains one of the most significant and mysterious atmospheric explosions in recorded history. Its immense power and lack of definitive evidence for a conventional impact make it a cornerstone case in studies of unexplained phenomena. It also underscores the potential vulnerabilities of Earth to cosmic or unknown forces.

See [[The Tunguska Event (1908)]]  

## 1917 - Count Zeppelin Dies 

Count Zeppelin dies in 1917. 

## 1917 - Goodyear-Zeppelin Starts Making High Altitude Balloons in Akron, Ohio

The same year, Goodyear-Zeppelin starts designing and building High Altitude Balloons. 

## 1917 – Fatima Apparitions 

Descriptions of luminous beings and phenomena interpreted as religious or extraterrestrial.
## 1914-1918 - World War I Erupts 

In 1914, the first of a series of world wars breaks out, through which humanity will weaponize the advanced technology it is developing against itself, and send its children to kill over 100 Million of its children in a single century. 

Looking back, what role did extraterrestrial influence and multi-dimensional warfare for control spiral humanity into conflict with itself, instead of its true enemies? 

## 1920 - Klemperer joins Aachen Aerodynamics Institute as an Assistant to Future Founder of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)

In 1920, after serving in the Austrian Air Force during World War I, Klemperer joins Aachen Aerodynamics Institute as assistant to Professor Theodore von Karman. 

Theodore von Karman would later go on to help found [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)]] via the series of events below. 

Klemperer would go on to lead advanced engineering relating to extraterrestrial technologies at Douglas. 
## 1920s - German Design of Space Vehicles Using Extraterrestrial Information? 

In the 1950s, Douglas Think Tank engineers learn that German scientists and engineers have been designing space-type vehicles since at least the 1920s, using what appears to be extraterrestrial information. 

## 1920 - 1930s - Thomas Townsend Brown

- **1921 – Initial Discovery**: Townsend Brown observed that high-voltage electrical charges applied to certain materials (e.g., barium titanate) produced a force in the direction of the charge. He called this effect the "Biefeld-Brown Effect."
    
- **1928 – Electrogravitic Patents**: Brown filed early patents for devices utilizing this effect for propulsion.
    
    - _U.S. Patent 1,974,483_ (1934): Describes a propulsion system using electrogravitic forces.
    - _U.S. Patent 3,018,394_ (1962): Details electrokinetic apparatus for aerial propulsion.
## 1926 - Daniel Guggenheim Funds University Aerospace and Rocketry Programs

In 1926, mining, aviation, and rocketry magnate Daniel Guggenheim founds the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. 

Between 1926 and 1930, he makes grants and establish schools or research centers at New York University, Stanford University, University of Michigan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Syracuse University, Northwestern University, University of Akron, and perhaps most importantly, Caltech. 

## 1926 – Nikola Tesla’s Martian Radio Signals  

Tesla renews claims of extraterrestrial communication.

## The Hessdalen Lights (1930s-Present)

**Summary:**  
The Hessdalen Lights are an enduring phenomenon of unexplained lights observed in the Hessdalen Valley, Norway, since the 1930s, with peaks in activity during the 1980s. These luminous phenomena, often described as glowing orbs or pulsating lights, have captivated researchers and witnesses alike. Exhibiting behaviors such as hovering, rapid movements, and abrupt directional changes, the lights defy conventional explanations. Despite decades of scientific investigation, including ongoing monitoring by the Hessdalen Automatic Measurement Station (HESS), the lights remain one of the most intriguing and studied UFO phenomena globally.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Hessdalen Lights represent a rare, consistent, and scientifically documented example of anomalous aerial phenomena. Their long-term presence and unexplained nature provide a unique opportunity to study the intersection of atmospheric science, physics, and potentially extraterrestrial or interdimensional phenomena.

See [[The Hessdalen Lights (1930s–Present)]]  
## 1930s - Ongoing Nazi Exposure to Extraterrestrial Technology 

Additional classified documents reviewed by Douglas Think Tank members reveals Nazi exposure to extraterrestrial technology at least from the 1930s. 

It is suspected that this exposure may date back to Count Zeppelin, flights of enormous dirigibles flights, and designs for futuristic cities with overhead monorail trams dating back to 1895. 

Alien involvement in German activities possibly leading into both of the World Wars. 

- The German Bell (_Die Glocke_): A rumored Nazi project exploring electromagnetic and anti-gravity principles during World War II.
- Allegations link post-war advancements in the U.S. and USSR to captured German scientists via Operation Paperclip.
## 1930 - Theodore von Karman Accepts Dictatorship at Caltech and Brings Rocketry to US

In 1914, Robert Millikan picked up on Plack and Eistein's work to obtain an accurate value of the Plack Constant. 

In 1921, he joined Caltech and worked with Victor Hess on detecting and analyzing radiation coming from space, later proving that it is of extraterrestrial origin. 

Millikan became chairman of Caltech, and along with Guggenheim convinced Theodore von Karman to emigrate the US and lead the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. 

In 1930, Theodore von Karman accepted the dictatorship at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). 

In 1936, he leads the start of work on rockets at Caltech. 

GALCIT was the first and only university-based rocket program from 1936-1940. 

## 1936 - Theodore von Karman founds Jet Propulions Laboratory (JPL)

Based on GALCIT's JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) project, in 1936 von Karman, along with a group of [[CalTech]] graduate students he was advising, founds [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)]]. 

## 1924 - German Aerospace Scientist / Engineer Wolfgang Klemperer Migrates to the US and Joins Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation

Back to Klemperer... 

Seven years later after Count Zeppelin's death and the start of High Altitude Balloon operations at Goodyear-Zeppelin, in 1924 German aerospace scientist / engineer Wolfgang Klemperer migrates to the United States and joined Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation in Akron, Ohio. 

Zeppelin Airship Company, based out of Friedrichshafen, held a 66% stake in the company. 

Klemperer, who would later be a lead figure in the Douglas Think Tank / Douglas Advanced Design UFO operations and reverse engineering, brings with him to Douglas a "bible" of Unconventional Propulsion Designs. 

These relationships and back story pave the way towards the early extraterrestrial information and technology provided to German / Austrian / Hungarian scientists, and the later collaboration among JPL, Douglas, etc. relating to extraterrestrial technologies and defense. 

## Aerial Motherships to Carry Fighter Planes

The US Navy becomes interested in aerial motherships to carry fighter planes. 

In the 20s, Klemperer becomes involved in the designs for two  large aerial motherships for the US Navy - the U.S.S. Akron and U.S.S Macon. 

In 1928, a contract is issued  from the US Navy for their build. 
## 1930s U.S.S. Akron and U.S.S. Macon Dirigible 

Operating in the 1930s, The U.S.S. Akron and U.S.S. Macon designed by Klemperer were dirigible models of large aircraft, which served as "motherships" to the fleet of warplanes they carried. 

Photos from the time show the U.S.S. Macon refueling warplanes. 

At 785 feet long, they ranked among the largest flying objects ever constructed. 

## 1934-1935 - US Army Stratospheric Research Project 

In 1934-1935, the US Army lauches the Stratospheric Research Project, launching high altitude baloons to research the upper atmosphere of Earth. 

Klemperer in significantly involved. 

Note this is happening concurrently with the rocket programs by Klemper's former supervisor at Caltech. 
## 1930s - Thousands of People Influenced to Get Off The Planet

In the 1930s, American civilians begin testing rocket designs in the deserts of New Mexico. 

In Europe, concentrated in Germany, thousands of people, apparently unrelated, become increasingly influenced / inspired to build a spacecraft and get off the planet. 

Many were not scientists or engineers, but farmers and blue collar workers. For instance a shoe salesman in Berlin working on electrostatic force acceleration. 

Why were there so many civilians, taking risks, mortgaging homes and farms, trying to get off the planet, in Germany, long before Hitler comes to power? 

Electrostatic force accelerator beams. 
Light energy. 
Ion propulsion. 
Electrical oscillators. 
Electromagnetism. 
Counteracting Gravity. 

## German SS Interest, Confiscation, and Kidnapping 

During the rise of the SS, according to Klemperer, every time the SS located one of these inventors, they arrested them, confiscated everything, and put them to work in their underground in-mountain research laboratories, working on their "star machines."

Years later - 1,442 or 1,444 Germans working on Klemperer's RLR-744 unconventional propulsion schemes.  

Douglas Think Tank participants believe that many of these individuals were receiving information and being telepathically influenced to develop the capability to move off the planet with their family and friends. 

## Propulsion Research, German / Alien Alliance, and Spies  

- In January 1937, Admiral Rico Botta is assigned to the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, until December 1942. He becomes head of the Power Plant Design Section (for advanced flying craft). 
- In December 1942 he reports for duty as Assembly and Repair Officer at the Naval Air Station, San Diego, California. 
- *Before he accepts the post*, he visits the heads of the three major aerospace companies in California. 
- In 1943, William Tompkins is mysteriously assigned to San Diego, and becomes staff to Admiral Rico Botta. 
- Flies monthly to Douglas and the other companies Admiral Rico Botta had visited, delivering highly classified intelligence on US efforts to keep up with German work with alien forces. 
- They information being delivered to the US aerospace companies is coming from US spies / operatives embedded in German operations, who confirm the Germans are being given brand new alien craft, and technical assistance from the aliens. 

I know it is hard to believe, but please keep and open mind and read on... 

## Pre-World War II Nazi / Hitler Deals with Aliens 

William Tompkins reports, and Linda Moulton Howe reports that multiple high ranking sources confirm he spoke truthfully, that... 

The operatives embedded reported that: 

- Hitler and the SS made agreements with the Reptilian Extraterrestrials 
- To give the SS secret information regarding ET vehicles, propulsion, controls, operation, and everything needed to build and put those technologies into production  
- To be used for the Aryan / German SS to remove the Jewish people from the planet, along with any organization that would be opposed to German dominance of Earth, in conjunction with Reptilian battle groups  
- Then they would expand to other star systems  
- The obsession of Hitler was to have the Aryan blondes take over the world, and exterminate the Hebrews  
- Blond Nordics were also aiding the US Military and aerospace industry in ensuring the success of the eventual Apollo program, which was to build a 10,000 man naval research base on the moon as Phase I. 
- Phase II was to develop naval bases on all habitable planets in the solar system, and / or their moons. 
- Phase III was to go to the 12 closest stars, and build naval bases on all of their habitable planets and moons. 
- Blondes vs. Reptilian extraterrestrials 
- In Germany, do we have many many Nordics, some wearing White Hats, and some wearing Black Hats 
- Some have said their may be as many as 100 different Nordic type ETs
- What Hitler was doing, the real mission... 
- Germany, unlike the US was given 250' diameter UFOs... (small ones)... by the reptilians. Given the controls, communications, methods of propulsion. 
- WWII was an alien war fought through human bodies 
- Given everything in them, even food processing to operate out in galaxy for years at a time. 
- In US, starting from scratch and trying to reverse engineer. 
- We are dealing with likely thousands of ET species, some of which come, take a look and leave 
- Others have various good, bad, and neutrally self-interested agendas 
- Reptilians can make themselves look like Nordics. 
- They can also *make Nordics*
- We have White Hats and Black Hats 
- Most importantly - you are living on a laboratory that has been being used for millennia for other advanced ET agendas, and supermarket for genetic materials. 
- Hitler and Germany didn't lose the war... 
- We did Operation Paperclip, bringing over 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians... 
- Joint Objectives Intelligence Agency (JOIA)... 
- Paperclip initiated by US Government... personnel getting into Germany, bringing this equipment to US, and some to Russia. But 80% was already removed, and we got the left-overs. 
- The German scientists continued the German mission of getting to the moon with Apollo, and then planning on going out into the galaxy. 
- Except the Reptilians were already on the moon, already had facilities there. 
- Many other extraterrestrial civilizations also working on "the moon", which is not a moon. 
- Unlike natural objects in the solar system, the moon doesn't rotate. It stays there looking at planet Earth. It is a vehicle for control. 
- When we got to the moon, the astronauts rotated cameras around the rim of the crater, revealing enormous vehicles parked there, and reptilians standing on the surface underneath their vehicles. 
- We are dealing with thousands of civilizations
- Certainly the Dracos and the Reptilians are part of that system of control 
- There are various organizations out in the galaxy... spanning many galaxies... that monitor star systems, their planets, their civilizations, and their aggression against other star systems 
- Many other species out there that are operating slave organizations  
- Reptilians had found that human Aryans were brilliant, even beyond themselves. 
- They wanted to modify themselves into something between a reptilian and a human as far as they could. 
- Abducting humans and interbreeding with different species, going on for hundreds of years with multiple extraterrestrial species 
- Then operating out in galaxies, and taking over other star's planets and enslaving them  
- This was part of the specific space missions using the reptilian space technologies 
- We have possibly 100 different types of humanoid extraterrestrials here... some which are nice and helpful... others are working with the reptilian / draco type... and taking over... not just to take over Earth and make it a slave planet... but going out into the galaxy to do the same thing... 
- For at least 5k years - since the Annunaki / Enlil / Enki line - told that we are alone in Universe - which is a lie 
- Titans vs. Zeus Greeks... 
- Competing territorial ET groups... 
- Who were the Annunaki? 
	- As we better understand our own real history... 
	- we have been lied to for over 5k years at least... 
- the kings and queens - continually had sexual relations with other countries - creating more of aryan race... 
- harvesting genetic materials from Earth, to make hybrids, clones, and worker bee androids 
- Harvesting DNA to make life forms, body parts, and containers - like humans work with manufacturing  
- Humans abducted for sperm and egg collections, minds and memories altered. 
- Cloned and hybridized bodies 

According to Defense Intelligence Analyst: 
"Earth's secret war is between three geopolitical, territorial, non-human intelligences in conflict with each other." Who have been in conflict for thousands if not millions of years. Including Nordics vs. the Reptilians and vs. Greys / Eben types... fighting using manipulation of time, minds, and 3D holographic projections that can transform how they and other material elements appear. All kinds of illusions in frequencies that humans cannot perceive with their eyes. 

Resurrection technologies. Able to manufacture biological bodies that can be inhabited. 

Requires technology to detect which player is inside of which body inside of which resurrection technology. 

Reptilians disclosed to Hitler and SS that they had 3 massive caverns in Antarctica. Agreement that Reptilians would allow Germans to take over two of those, in order to continue building UFO technologies, and working on a collaborative mission to take over the Earth, and make the entire population blond haired blue eyed Nordics working with the reptilians. 

Military personnel report being in caverns and witnessing alien craft capable of being in air or underwater. 

Deep under ice, in massive structures, that still had light, power, long corridors, lime green light that moves with body. 

Half mile long alien spacecraft support German military from space. 

# The Magenta, Italy UFO Crash (1933)

**Summary:**  
The Magenta UFO Crash, also known as the "Italian Roswell," is one of the earliest recorded UFO retrieval cases, occurring in June 1933 near Magenta, Italy. Witnesses reported the crash of a mysterious craft that resembled a metallic saucer, followed by a rapid military response. Under the orders of Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime, the object was allegedly secured and studied in secrecy. Some accounts suggest that the Vatican played a role in concealing the event. Recently declassified documents and whistleblower accounts have reignited interest in the incident, positioning it as a precursor to modern UFO investigations.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Magenta crash is significant for its historical timing, predating other famous UFO incidents such as Roswell by over a decade. It suggests that government-level UFO retrievals may have begun earlier than widely believed and that global powers, including Italy and the Vatican, were aware of extraterrestrial phenomena in the early 20th century.

See [[The Magenta, Italy UFO Crash (1933)]]  

## 1938 – Orson Welles’ _War of the Worlds_ 

Radio broadcast causes mass panic, reflecting public fears of extraterrestrial invasion.

# The Men in Black Phenomena

**Summary:**  
The Men in Black (MIB) phenomena refers to mysterious individuals or beings, often dressed in black suits, who allegedly intimidate or silence witnesses of UFO sightings and other paranormal events. Described as emotionless and robotic, these figures are known for their eerie demeanor, advanced knowledge, and strange behavior. First reported in the mid-20th century, the Men in Black have become one of the most enduring elements of UFO folklore, with theories ranging from government agents to extraterrestrial or interdimensional beings.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Men in Black phenomena represents a chilling intersection of UFO sightings, government secrecy, and potential non-human intervention. These encounters raise profound questions about who—or what—is monitoring humanity’s interactions with unexplained phenomena and why silencing witnesses is deemed necessary.

See [[The Men in Black Phenomena]]  
## 1939 – Battle of the Heligoland Bight

RAF pilots report UFO-like craft engaging them.

# The Foo Fighters Phenomenon (1940s)

**Summary:**  
During World War II, Allied and Axis pilots frequently reported encountering unexplained aerial phenomena termed "Foo Fighters." These glowing orbs of light, often red, orange, or white, exhibited erratic movements, high speeds, and apparent intelligence. Despite extensive military investigations, the nature and origin of the Foo Fighters remain unexplained, marking one of the earliest widespread and credible accounts of unidentified aerial phenomena.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Foo Fighters represent one of the first well-documented cases of UFOs involving credible military witnesses under combat conditions. These sightings laid the groundwork for modern UFO studies and underscore the mystery of advanced aerial phenomena witnessed by skilled observers.

See [[The Foo Fighters Phenomenon (1940s)]]  
## 1940 – Battle of Britain UFOs 

**Summary:**  
During the intense aerial combat of the Battle of Britain in 1940, several British and German pilots reported sightings of mysterious unidentified flying objects. These objects, which appeared as glowing or metallic crafts, often performed maneuvers that defied known aviation technology of the era. While the sightings were overshadowed by the war, they remain one of the earliest examples of wartime UFO reports, predating the better-documented Foo Fighters of the mid-1940s.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Battle of Britain UFO sightings represent some of the earliest recorded instances of pilots encountering unexplained aerial phenomena during combat. These encounters add to the growing body of evidence suggesting a connection between military activity and UFO sightings.



## The Cape Girardeau UFO Crash (1941)

**Summary:**  
The Cape Girardeau UFO Crash of 1941 is a lesser-known but significant pre-Roswell event involving the alleged retrieval of a downed alien craft and its occupants in southeast Missouri. According to witnesses, the craft crashed in a rural area near Cape Girardeau, and a local preacher was called to perform last rites for the deceased. The incident reportedly involved a metallic, disc-shaped craft and three humanoid beings. The military quickly arrived, confiscated the wreckage, and imposed secrecy on those involved. Though shrouded in mystery, this case provides early evidence of UFO retrievals and government cover-ups.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
Occurring six years before the Roswell Incident, the Cape Girardeau UFO Crash suggests that government awareness of UFO phenomena may date back earlier than widely assumed. The involvement of a preacher, the reported alien beings, and the military’s swift response provide intriguing parallels to later UFO incidents.

See [[The Cape Girardeau UFO Crash (1941)]]  
# The Battle of Los Angeles (1942)

**Summary:**  
The Battle of Los Angeles is one of the most dramatic UFO events in history. On the night of February 24–25, 1942, thousands of residents witnessed a massive unidentified craft hovering over the city, accompanied by as many as 12 smaller objects. Illuminated by dozens of searchlights, the objects endured sustained fire from anti-aircraft guns. Despite the military firing over 1,400 rounds, the craft remained unscathed and eventually vanished without a trace. Official explanations ranged from weather balloons to mass hysteria, but eyewitness accounts and photographic evidence tell a different story—one of an extraordinary aerial event that defied conventional explanation and left a lasting legacy of mystery and speculation.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Battle of Los Angeles was one of the first widely witnessed UFO encounters, combining credible civilian and military observations with dramatic evidence of government response. The event challenged wartime nerves, revealed the limitations of contemporary technology, and became a cultural touchstone for UFO phenomena, sparking questions that remain unanswered to this day.

See: [[The Battle of Los Angeles (1942)]] 

## Motherships and Landing Vehicles

These various sized crafts, and hundreds subsequently reported, made it clear that there were very likely interplanetary or interstellar mothership(s) orbiting our planet...

...that had dispatched hundreds of surveillance and landing craft to Earth. 

## Observation and Influence 

Prior and subsequent events made it very clear that some form, or forms, of advanced alien intelligence were not only observing our planet, but influencing it. 

## 1944 – Foo Fighters in the Pacific

U.S. pilots describe glowing orbs shadowing planes during missions.
## July 16, 1945 - Trinity Nuclear Test Causes UFO to Crash 

Famed astrophysicist Jacques Vallee, consultant to Project Blue Book, reports that the first US nuclear test, Trinity, caused a 5 ton avocado shaped UFO to crash. 

## The San Antonio, New Mexico "Trinity" UFO Crash (1945)

**Summary:**  
The San Antonio, New Mexico UFO Crash, also referred to as the “Trinity Crash,” occurred in August 1945, mere weeks after the first atomic bomb test at the nearby Trinity site. Two young boys, José Padilla and Reme Baca, witnessed a strange craft crash on a remote ranch. The object, described as an oval-shaped metallic craft, left an impression in the terrain and reportedly contained small humanoid beings. Military personnel swiftly arrived, securing the site and removing the wreckage. The case has drawn renewed attention for its potential connection to heightened UFO activity following nuclear events.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The San Antonio crash is notable for its timing, occurring just after the Trinity nuclear test, and for being one of the earliest documented UFO crashes in modern history. It offers critical insights into the relationship between nuclear activity and UFO phenomena, as well as early government responses to unidentified aerial craft.

See [[The San Antonio, New Mexico "Trinity" UFO Crash (1945)]] 

## 1945  Top Secret Report to Secretary of War 

- Commanding Geeral of the Army Air Fores, H.H. "Hap" Arnold calls for unprecedented coordination among the military, industry, and the universities. "Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actual research and development". 
- This apparently arose from the emergent conclusion / concern that alien beings were among us, and might be thousands or millions of years more technologically advanced than us. 
- This accelerates the creation of [[Military Industrial Complex]] that President Eisenhower warns American's about in his departure from office speech. 

## October 1945 - Building the Team

- At direction of [[James Forrestal]], Secretary of the Navy, October 1, 1945, General Hap Arnold, Edward Bowles of MIT, Donald Dougas (President of Douglas Aircraft), Arthur Raymong (Chief Engineer at Douglas) and Frank Collbohm (also Douglas) added to the secret team to study and address the threats posed by UFOs and the advanced extraterrestrial beings apparently operating them. 

## William Tompkins and The Secret Space Programs (SSP)

**Summary:**  
William Tompkins, a former aerospace engineer and naval intelligence operative, emerged in recent years as a central figure in the disclosure movement, making extraordinary claims about the existence of secret space programs (SSP) and humanity's decades-long interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations. According to Tompkins, he worked on advanced aerospace designs inspired by extraterrestrial technology, participated in intelligence-gathering efforts about Nazi collaboration with aliens during World War II, and contributed to the development of a U.S. space fleet capable of interstellar travel. His testimony links military, corporate, and extraterrestrial efforts in one of the most audacious narratives of hidden history ever proposed.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
Tompkins’s revelations, though controversial, provide a detailed account of covert human-extraterrestrial interactions and technological advancements. His testimony connects multiple strands of UFO and SSP narratives, including Operation Paperclip, reverse engineering of alien craft, and global elite agendas. Whether wholly true or partly speculative, his claims have fueled significant debate and investigation into secretive aerospace activities and alien involvement in Earth’s affairs.

## Douglas Think Tank / RAND Predecessor Forms

In the mid 1940s, in response to the growing alien awareness and threats, a way-above-top-secret think tank was established at Douglas, led by [[Elmer Wheaton]] (Caltech PHD) and his German Scientific Advisor [[Wolfgang B. Klemperer]]. 

Note earlier ties of German engineers to the inception of the Caltech aeronautics programs. 

Numerous CalTech PHDs would be subsequently recruited into various aspects of the broader military programs relating to alien craft and intelligence, including family members of people Jordan knows directly. 

The Think Tank predecessor defines the RAND concept mission for the US Military. 
	- Includes communications and receiver antennas to identify alien craft entering Earthian air space.
## December 1945 - RAND 

- In late 1945 there was apparently a secret meeting at the Army Air Corps Headquarters at Hamilton Field, California to set up Project RAND. 
- Project RAND was to be a hyper secret think tank to grapple with the implications of the threatening alien agendas.  
- RAND was formally created in December 1945 as a special contract to [[Douglas Aircraft Company (DAC)]]. 

## 1945 - New Government Positions 

- At the same time, the office of the Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development was established. 
- Major General Curtis Le May is first appointee.
- RAND Reports into the newly created position. 

## 1946 - Operation Highjump - Antarctica 

Admiral Richard Byrd leads a large military expedition to Antarctica in December 1946, including 4,700 military personnel, aircraft carriers, battleships, and dozens of aircraft. 

Look up Admiral Byrd's journal. 

## 1946 - 1950 - Getting Off the Planet

As disclosed in the MTM-622 Unconventional Propulsion Schemes... questions relating to why, from 1946 to 1950, technically qualified experts from around the planet were massively driven / induced to conceive of methods to get off the planet, and into the galaxy and beyond. 

And the origins of apparent extraterrestrial involvement back to the 1870s in Germany and 1910s in US. 

## 1945 - 1959 - Operation Paperclip Imports Over 1,600 German and Nazi Scientists, Engineers, and Technicians

Between 1945 and 1959, under a secret United States intelligence program over 1,600 German and Nazi scientists, engineers, and technicians were taken from Germany and imported into the United States for employment by the US Government and [[Military Industrial Complex]]. These include many former members and leaders of the Nazi party, who subsequently ran many of the programs mentioned below. 

The effort began in 1945, after the Allies entered Germany and revealed the advanced science and technology that Germany had apparently inherited from their deal with the aliens. 

Subsequently, US President Truman would reportedly make a similar deal with the aliens. 

The scientists imported were primarily involved in the Nazi rocket program, aerospace, and chemical and biological warfare. 

The lists were obtained from Werner Osenberg and Wernher von Braun. 

Operation Paperclip was the apparent successor to Operation Overcast, established by the US Joint Chiefs of staff July 20, 1945. 

## National Interest / Project 63

Project 63 provided job placement assistance for Nazi engineers at Lockheed, Martin Marietta, North American Aviation, and other aerospace companies while American engineers were being laid off. 

## 1946 - Ghost Rockets in Scandinavia 

**Summary:**  
The Ghost Rockets were a series of unexplained aerial phenomena observed across Scandinavia in 1946, primarily in Sweden. These cigar-shaped objects, often described as resembling missiles or rockets, were seen by thousands of witnesses. Unlike conventional aircraft, they displayed erratic flight patterns, emitted no discernible sound, and sometimes appeared to crash into lakes without leaving debris. Despite extensive investigations by Swedish authorities and international intelligence agencies, including the U.S. and Greek militaries, the origins of the Ghost Rockets remain a mystery.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Ghost Rockets represent one of the earliest documented mass sightings of unexplained aerial phenomena in the post-WWII era. Their appearance during heightened geopolitical tensions sparked speculation about advanced secret technologies, extraterrestrial craft, and interdimensional activity. The incidents remain a cornerstone in UFO research, predating the more famous Roswell Incident by a year.

See [[The Ghost Rockets of Scandinavia (1946)]]  
## 1946 - Douglas Think Tank Officially Born 

- March 2, 1946 - letter of contract places Project RAND under direction of Frank Collbohm of [[Douglas Aircraft Company (DAC)]]. 
- [[Douglas Think Tank]] is officially born.
- Scope of work encompasses the full gamut of problems and threats posed by the aliens, who were considered to be technologically thousands of years beyond us. 

## 1946 - Douglas / RAND Hires the German Rocket Engineers

Douglas then hires many of the German rocket engineers. 

## The Path to TRW 

After Douglas hired the German rocket engineers...

..they collectively collaborated with their peers at North American Aviation, Northrop, Aerojet General Engineers, etc.... 

...who collaborated with engineers at Hughes, Caltech, UCLA, etc...

...to eventually form the Ramo Wooldridge Corporation 1953... 

...and then merging and hiring many of the above into the Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Company in 1958, subsequently shortened to TRW. 

(Thompson Products being a valve manufacturer that aided in early flight feats). 

Interestingly, the origins of TRW, Inc. go back to 1901. 

It was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002, along with Grumman Aerospace and Westinghouse plus. 

Northrop Grumman founded by Leroy Grumman as Grumman Aircraft Engineering in 1929. During World War II, builds all aircraft for the US Navy. Later builds the Apollo Lunar Module. 

Jack Northrop founded Northrop Corporation in 1939, creating the experimental XB-35 and YB-49 aircraft in the 1940s and 1950s after cycling through Douglas Aircraft (1923) and Lockheed Corporation (1927) (chief engineer on record setting Lockheed Vega). Specialty in fixed wing and experimental concepts. 

Northrop Grumman spun off TRW Automotive to none other than ZF Friedrichshafen, looping the German engineering cycle full circle back to Count Zeppelin. 

## Kenneth Arnold’s Sighting of Flying Crescents (1947)

**Summary:**  
Kenneth Arnold’s sighting on June 24, 1947, near Mount Rainier, Washington, is widely regarded as the incident that introduced the term “flying saucer” into popular culture and launched the modern UFO phenomenon. Arnold, a respected private pilot, reported seeing nine crescent-shaped objects flying at incredible speeds in formation. His sighting set off a media frenzy and led to a wave of similar reports, marking the beginning of America’s fascination with unidentified flying objects.

See: [[Kenneth Arnold's Sighting of Flying Crescents (1947)]]  

## Summer 1947 - Hundreds of Credible Reports 

- After Kenneth Arnold sighting gains media attention, hundreds of similar reports follow, breaking the silence of experience over the past years. 
- Many reports are from highly credible military and civilian sources. 

## Summer 1947 - Unsuccessful Military Pursuits 

- US military tries unsuccessfully to use its craft to pursue discs in flight. 
- Many US planes are shot down. Top pilots and planes lost. 

## The Maury Island Incident (1947)

**Summary:**  
The Maury Island Incident is one of the earliest and most controversial UFO cases, involving strange metallic debris, mysterious flying objects, and alleged government intimidation. On June 21, 1947, Harold Dahl claimed to witness six doughnut-shaped crafts near Maury Island, Washington. One of the objects ejected molten metal-like material, damaging Dahl’s boat and injuring his dog. This case not only predates Roswell but also introduced elements of secrecy, manipulation, and threats—hallmarks of UFO lore—including what some believe to be the first appearance of the enigmatic “Men in Black.”

See [[The Maury Island Incident (1947)]]  
## July 5, 1947 - UFO Crash near Roswell, New Mexico - and Military Coverup

The Roswell Incident is widely regarded as the most famous UFO event in modern history and the genesis of government secrecy surrounding extraterrestrial encounters. In July 1947, a craft believed by many to be of extraterrestrial origin crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. Witnesses described strange metallic debris with advanced properties, beams marked with indecipherable hieroglyphic-like symbols, and—most sensationally—the recovery of four small humanoid beings. Although the U.S. Army Air Force initially announced the recovery of a "flying disc," they quickly retracted the statement, attributing the debris to a weather balloon. Decades later, firsthand witnesses, posthumous confessions, and advanced material analyses have cast significant doubt on the official narrative, fueling speculation about a massive cover-up, reverse-engineering of alien technology, and secret agreements with extraterrestrial beings.

See [[The Roswell Incident (1947)]]  

## 1947 - Military Personnel + Family Interference 

Military personnel and their families experiencing strange things. 

For instance a military pilot (in his craft) and his wife (at home) both experience an intense electromagnetic sensation right before his craft is jammed and crashed by alien interference. 

Numerous alien interferences with US military craft and missiles. 
## 1947 - Truman Reportedly Meets With and Makes Deal With Aliens 

While it is nearly impossible to believe, multiple apparently credible sources report that after the Roswell crash in 1947 and US Military / Alien UFO air battles, President Truman physically meets with the Aliens.  

It is (almost incredibly) reported that the US Government made a deal with the aliens to allow a limited number of citizens to be kidnapped / abducted / harvested each week, in exchange for advanced extraterrestrial technology. 

Following this meeting, it is reported that at least hundreds of people a week are being abducted. 
## September 1947 - Operation MAJESTIC-12

- September 24, 1947 - Operation [[MAJESTIC-12]] created on recommendation of: 
	- James Forrestal, now Secretary of Defense, formerly Secretary of Navy, later assassinated. 
	- Dr. Vannevar Bush, 
	- Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter
- Admiral Hillenkoetter leads the group. 
- Reports only to President of the United States. 
- MAJESTIC-Eyes-Only R&D / Intelligence operation. 
- Newly created Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development and the Project RAND Group reported only to Majestic-12 at the time.

## 1948 - Douglas Think Tank and RAND Split 

- By early 1948, conflicts of interest were emerging between RAND and Douglas Manufacturing. 
- RAND and Douglas divorce.

## The Aztec UFO Crash (1948)

**Summary:**  
The Aztec UFO Crash is one of the most controversial and debated UFO incidents, centering on reports of a large flying saucer that allegedly crashed near Aztec, New Mexico, in March 1948. Witnesses claimed that the craft, approximately 100 feet in diameter, was largely intact and contained the bodies of 16 small humanoid beings. While initially dismissed as a hoax, the incident resurfaced decades later with claims of government retrieval and reverse-engineering of alien technology. The Aztec case is often seen as a companion to Roswell, sparking intrigue about an era of frequent UFO crashes and recoveries.

See [[The Aztec UFO Crash (1948)]]  

## The Laredo UFO Crash and “Burnt Alien” (1948)

**Summary:**  
The Laredo UFO Crash, often referred to as the “Burnt Alien” case, involves the alleged crash of a UFO near Laredo, Texas, in July 1948. Witnesses reported seeing a craft explode in mid-air before crashing into the desert. Military personnel quickly secured the area, recovering metallic debris and, more shockingly, the body of a severely burned humanoid being. The case is notable for the detailed descriptions of the being, often cited as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Though shrouded in secrecy, it remains a cornerstone of early UFO crash investigations.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Laredo crash is significant for its early documentation of a humanoid occupant associated with a UFO crash. The detailed descriptions of the being, combined with the military’s swift response and the unusual materials recovered, make it a compelling case in UFO history.

See [[The Laredo Crash and "Burnt Alien" (1948)]]  
## The Mantell UFO Incident (1948)

**Summary:**  
The Mantell UFO Incident is one of the earliest and most tragic UFO encounters to involve the death of a military pilot. On January 7, 1948, Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a seasoned World War II pilot with the Kentucky Air National Guard, pursued a massive, unidentified object reported by witnesses across multiple states. As he ascended in his P-51 Mustang, Mantell lost control and crashed to his death. Official explanations ranged from a weather balloon to pilot error, but witnesses described a craft that defied known aeronautical capabilities, fueling speculation that Mantell encountered an extraterrestrial vehicle.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Mantell Incident is a milestone in UFO history, highlighting the potential dangers of interactions with unidentified aerial phenomena. With numerous witnesses, credible radar tracking, and the tragic loss of a decorated pilot, it became a pivotal case in sparking public and military interest in UFO investigations.

See [[The Mantell UFO Incident (1948)]]
## 1948 - Order to Intercept and Shoot

Since early 1948, American military forces were under orders to intercept and shoot down unknown alien craft. 

This status effectively puts America at war with several hostile alien civilizations for a number of years. 

Engagements provide increasing clarity about the multiples types of alien craft operating on and around Earth. 

## Alien Craft Down Military Craft

Admiral Conway reports to Secretary Forrestal's people that multiple types of alien craft are operating, and will continue to operate, in restricted airspace, and over every secret US nuclear research facility. 

When US military craft are scrambled to try to force the aliens to land, the aliens respond by shooting "all our craft down". 

Military patrol aircraft are also attacked and destroyed. 

An unknown ray weapon is used to down the planes and kill the crews. 

Years later, after losing many top pilots and aircraft in the effort to chase and take down UFO, orders were changed to intercept but do not engage. 

## Missile Interference

Alien forces undertake a systematic campaign to interfere with, intercept, and prevent success on missile tests and missions. 

At White Sands and other locations. 

## The Gorman Dogfight (1948)

**Summary:**  
The Gorman Dogfight is one of the earliest and most extraordinary aerial encounters between a human pilot and an unidentified flying object. On the evening of October 1, 1948, Lieutenant George F. Gorman engaged in a high-speed, 27-minute chase with a luminous, highly maneuverable object over Fargo, North Dakota. Despite Gorman’s attempts to intercept, the UFO consistently outpaced and outmaneuvered his P-51 Mustang, displaying flight characteristics far beyond any known human technology of the time. The incident remains a classic example of military encounters with UFOs, sparking debate about the capabilities and origins of the mysterious craft.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Gorman Dogfight highlights the advanced flight characteristics often attributed to UFOs, including extreme speed, rapid changes in direction, and apparent intelligence in evading pursuit. It is a key case demonstrating the limitations of human technology against unidentified phenomena and remains one of the most credible and detailed UFO encounters.

See [[The Gorman Dogfight (1948)]]

## 1947 - 1948 – Project Sign

The U.S. Air Force established its first official UFO investigation program, later transitioning to Project Grudge and Project Blue Book.

## Project Grudge (1949)


## 1949 – FBI Memo on Roswell  

An FBI memo discusses recovered alien bodies from the Roswell crash.
## 1949 - Civilian Background Radiation Testing Detects UFO Radiation Bursts

In 1949, Dr. Walter Riedel, of rocket engine research (later known as Rocketdyne Division) at North American Aviatation (NAA), leads a group of scientists to start measuring background radiation in association with sightings of UFOs. 

From their base in the desert, the UFOs seemingly consciously interact with them, and large bursts of radiation with no other apparent causes are detected at the time of the sightings. 

## 1949 - Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI) Established

[[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]] is established to investigate the phenomenon further.

## 1949 Project Sign, and Project Bluebook

In 1949, Project Sign is established by the Air Force to further investigate UFO sightings and phenomena. 

Later, it gained the backing of Admiral Delmar Fahrney, head of Navy's guided missile program, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, and Air Force General Nathan Twining, and becomes Project Blue Book. 

Captain Edward J. Ruppelt becomes first head of Project blue Book. 

12,618 sightings are reported to Project Blubook, with 701 remaining unidentified. 

The leads involved all acknowledge that UFOs are real and a threat to Earth. 

The national security elite continue to press to keep all information secret. 

## 1949 - Secretary of Defense Forrestal Forced to Resign, and Subsequently Assassinated 

After tensions build between Truman and Forrestal, who opposed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and the centralizing of power of the Department of Defense, in 1949 Secretary Forrestal is forced by Truman to resign. 

He is suddenly hospitalized for supposed mental health issues / stress-induced paranoia.  

He is placed on the top floor of the hospital he being treated at, and thrown out of the window during the night, dying on impact. 

The MAJESTIC 12 documents report that military officials called his "untimely death" unfortunate but necessary. 

We have noted that citizens of fascist states who know too much and fall out of favor tend to fall out of windows at an alarming rate. 

President Truman apparently conceals his medical records as part of teh coverup. 

- Annex C - Fragment [https://majesticdocuments.com/documents/majestic-documents/documents-dated-1948-1959/#annual](https://majesticdocuments.com/documents/majestic-documents/documents-dated-1948-1959/#annual)
- Note handwritten references to “put in Angelton’s ‘Yellow’ files – J1” and “Project White Hot.” 
- Note “The untimely death of Secretary Forrestal was deemed necessary and regrettable.” 
- If a valid document, implies that Twining’s White Hot report compels President Truman to sign the National Security Act of 1947.

## If Forrestal Is Not Running Things, Who Is? 

After Forrestal's assassination, it becomes increasingly unclear who is running the newly created Deep State / Security State, and its extraterrestrial operations. 

## 1950 – CIA Interest in UFOs

Declassified memos reveal UFOs as a national security concern.

## 1950 - Cover Almost Blown by Book "Flying Saucers Are Real"

In 1950, Major Donald Keyhoe, an American Marine Corps naval aviator, revealed in the book "Flying Saucers Are Real" that the military knew that flying saucers were extraterrestrial, and was concealing the information to avoid public panic. 

Keyhoe argued that extraterrestrials had been surveiling the Earth for at least two centuries, with their observation and interventions increasing suddenly and dramatically following the series of atomic bomb explosions in 1945. 

This book almost blew the cover, but the flare up was later covered over by the government. 

Government conspiracy and coverup became the focus of his second book in 1955 *The Flying Saucer Conspiracy*. 

## 1950 – The McMinnville UFO Photos  

Iconic images of a saucer-like UFO in Oregon.

## 1950 – Project Magnet (Canada)

A Canadian government study investigates UFO propulsion systems.
## 1951 - A Craft Over a Mile Long Visits a Air Craft Carrier Battle Group

In early 1951, Admiral Steve McDonley, a top combat officer in the Navy, was leading a battle group including the US Coral Sea CVB-41 through the South China Sea. 

A massive cylindrical vehicle over a mile long (~8,000 feet) and 500' in diameter descended above the ship, encompassing the entire battle group in brilliant light. 

[[1951 U.S.S. Coral Sea - South China Sea]]  

## 1951 - CSI Confirms High Levels of Radiation in Soils at 1951 Crash Sites

CSI confirms that high levels of radiation were detected in soil at the area of the January and February 1951 UFO crashes. 

This confirms their earlier observations of radiation bursts associated with UFO sightings. 

This provides further information regarding the advanced Unconventional Propulsion and Weapons Systems in use. 

## 1951 – Lubbock Lights 

Formation of lights over Texas sparks military investigation.

## 1951 – Argentina UFO Wave

Dozens of reports across Buenos Aires include landed craft.

## 1952 – Brazil’s Barra da Tijuca Incident

Photographs of UFOs emerge, confirmed by local officials.

## The Flatwoods Monster Incident (1952)

**Summary:**  
The Flatwoods Monster Incident occurred on September 12, 1952, in Flatwoods, West Virginia, when several local residents reported encountering a strange, towering entity after witnessing a glowing, fiery object crash into a nearby hillside. The event, accompanied by physical symptoms and multiple eyewitness accounts, remains one of the most unusual and debated UFO cases, blending elements of extraterrestrial sightings, cryptid lore, and mass hysteria.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Flatwoods Monster Incident stands out as a unique blend of UFO and cryptid phenomena, showcasing how a single event can resonate culturally and persist in public memory. Its detailed eyewitness descriptions and physical effects offer compelling evidence for researchers exploring the boundaries between extraterrestrial and interdimensional phenomena.

See [[The Flatwoods Monster Incident (1952)]]  

## The Washington D.C. UFO Flap (1952)

**Summary:**  
The Washington D.C. UFO Flap of July 1952 is one of the most compelling UFO events in history, involving multiple sightings of unidentified flying objects over the U.S. capital, one of the most sensitive airspaces in the world. Over two weekends, from July 12–29, radar operators, pilots, and civilians observed luminous, fast-moving objects performing extraordinary maneuvers. The sightings triggered national attention, an unprecedented military scramble that was powerless in the face of superior technology, and a high-level government press conference. Official explanations ranged from temperature inversions to misidentified aircraft, but the combination of visual and radar confirmations remains a cornerstone of UFO investigations.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Washington D.C. UFO Flap marked a turning point in UFO studies, demonstrating the inability of even the most advanced military technology of the time to confront or explain the phenomenon. Its proximity to key government institutions and military installations added to its significance, prompting both public intrigue and classified investigations.

See [[The Washington D.C. UFO Flap (1952)]] 
## Sightings Increase, and Concern Grows

Sightings become more and more frequent, particularly around nuclear and missile testing areas. 

This raises concerns among a growing number of military and industrial personnel that the UFOs and their extraterrestrial pilots (and the battle groups they operate as part of) are engaged in systematic and targeted surveillance of advanced military facilities and technologies. 

It becomes apparent that it was possible or likely that at least thousands of years ago, these species had become technologically advanced enough to move off their planet, beyond their solar systems, and that we were now encountering their battle and cruiser groups in our local area of the galaxy. 

And that the long term survival of a non-enslaved and exploited human species depends on our ability to confront and overcome the threat. 

## Project Blue Book (1952–1969)

While public conclusions often downplayed the extraterrestrial hypothesis, internal documents reveal significant concern about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).
## 1952 - Douglas Determines that UFOs are Short Range Reconnaissance Vehicles Operating From Mother Ships

In 1952, working on studies of deep space starship designs, Douglas Advanced Design determined that UFOs were short-range reconnaissance vehicles operating out of motherships (essentially space-based aircraft carriers).

This had been apparent to some since the 40s, and was now confirmed. 

This led to a design push around Spacecraft Carriers for the US Military, the largest ships in our forthcoming galactic Navy. 

Note that this is long pre-NOVA / pre-Apollo. 

## 1952 - Douglas Reveals US and Soviet Awareness 

- In 1952, studies from Douglas Think Tank reveal that members of the US Government and Soviet Union are definitively aware of alien involvement in human affairs. 
- Soviet union may be working with "alien assistance" to get to the moon first, establish missile bases, and control the planet. 
- This turns out to be the same as Hitler's plan. 

## Air Force Releases Information *Countering* the Existence of UFOs and Their Threat

After approximately three years of study by Projects Sign and Blue Book, the Air Force releases information *countering* the existence of UFOs and their threat to the planet. 

Eventually Ruppelt leaves the Air Force. 

Douglas hires him as a consultant on extraterrestrials for Advanced Design. 

Shortly thereafter, he is dead, ostensibly because of a second heart attack. 
## "Catch Up With Whoever Is Out There..."

The increasingly irrefutable reality that we are interacting with hostile forces thousands of years more technologically advanced than us creates a massive mandate / push to "catch up with whoever is out there."

## Telepathic Communications 

In the 1950s, becomes increasingly obvious that numerous individuals are receiving telepathic messaging from alien entities.  

## Alien Infiltration and Co-Workers 

In the 1950s, becomes increasingly obvious that aliens have physically infiltrated and are actively working in, for, and against multiple companies and agencies involved in the efforts surrounding the phenomena. 

Numerous scientists and inventors report clear telepathic communications which forthrightly present to them solutions to the most difficult problems facing various programs to reach space and counter alien threats. 

Conversely, there is open discussion of other alien forces infiltrating and disrupting progress. 

## "Some of the Reptilians Are Really Getting Hard to Deal With"

Klemperer is reported first hand to have said "Some of the Reptilians are really getting hard to deal with." 

Jim Cooper reports that there are Reptilians managing Greys in underground facilities in several western states. 

US Navy is attempting to monitor activies. 

It is later discovered that aliens have apparently been living and operating in massive underground facilities connected by tunnels for at least hundreds of years. 

## Alien Mind Control 

Alien capabilities to engage in both telepathic communication and mind control becomes increasingly clear. 

Mind interference and control includes forced forgetting / memory wipe. 

This is very widely also experienced by abductees, as later confirmed by Harvard [[John Mack]] in a 10 year plus intensive study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. 

Douglas Think Tank participants would later learn that there were at least nineteen different [[Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs)]] operating at present on Earth, who possess the ability to control our minds and conceal their physical presence, as well as the physical presence of their craft. 

Einstein is credibly reported to have worked with the US Military on similar invisibility capabilities for its assets. 

It should be investigated whether this occurred in combination with alien technology transfers. 
## CIA Mind Control 

In the early 1940s, Nazi scientists conducted mind control experiments on prisoners in the concentration camps. 

In 1943, the Office of Strategic Services begins development of a "truth drug". 

In 1947, US Navy initiates Project CHATTER, an interrogation project testing LSD on human subjects. 

In 1950, CIA initiates series of interrogations projects beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird. 

August 20, 1951, Project Artichoke initiated to see if any individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination, followed by amnesia. Morphine, mescaline, and LSD were administered on unknowing CIA agents. 

April 13, 1953, on order of CIA Director Allen Dulles, project advanced to develop mind-controlling drugs and techniques for use against soviet bloc, prisoners of war, and foreign leaders. 

These programs often conducted experiments without knowledge or consent of the subjects. 

Subproject 54 was the Navy's "Perfect Concussion" program to use frequency blasts to erase memory. 

MK Ultra initiated by CIA to explore ways to weaken, destroy, and control the human mind. 
- Included numerous forms of torture, abuse (including sexual) and experimentation on citizens of multiple countries without their consent. 
- Included *over 80 institutions aside from the military*
- More than 150 secret subprojects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs. 

1957 Subproject 68 explored techniques for manipulating and controlling human behavior through methods of psychic driving and depatterning, often couple with placing subjects under the influence of powerful psychoactive substances. 

1964 - MKULTRA transformed and continued under MKSEARCH, subdivided into MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT. 

These tested the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive materials to produce predictable behavioral and psychological changes in humans in support of secret operational requirements. 

Historians suggest a goal was to produce a "Manchurian Candidate" (someone brainwashed into being an unwitting assassin). 

MKUltra records destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director Richard Helms. 

In concert with panic around [[Watergate]]. 

1976 Church Committee reports found that MKDELTA and MKULTRA materials were used for harrassment, discrediting, and disabling purposes. 

## Experiments on US Citizens and Candians

CIA and other departments of the Security States conducts experiments on unwitting and congnizent human subjects in US and Canada. 

"Prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects". 

According to Ted Kennedy on Senate Floor: 

*"The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an "extensive testing and experimentation" program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens "at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign." Several of these tests involved the administration of LSD to "unwitting subjects in social situations.""*
## Secret CIA Detention Camps, Torture, and Experimentation

Starting at least in early 1950s, CIA creates secret detention centers in Europe and East Asia, capturing and detaining people who were subjected to torture and experimentation on how to destroy and control human minds. 

## 1952 - Dr. Robert's Report to the CIA - The Potential Threat of Some Extraterrestrial Life Forms

In 1952, Dr. Robert's delivers to CIA a report titled "The Potential Threat of Some Extraterrestrial Life Forms."

## 1952 - Requirements for a Galactic Navy 

By 1952, open and frequent discussion underway regarding the requirements for galactic Navy

## 1952 - Planning the First 12 Star Missions 

Long prior to the creation of NASA and public launch of moon mission, the group is in deep planning and discussion for missions to visit the 12 nearest stars, some of which are the "home" solar systems of alien life we are interacting with. 

## Deep Waters

USOs - Underwater Submerged Objects encountered give rise to the military desire to develop an undersea reconnaissance missions operations center. 

Requirements included giant boring machines capable of operating in deep ocean trenches, and tunneling deep into the Earth's crust. 

Military believes there are extraterrestrial underground and underwater bases possibly operating secretly all over the planet.

Admiral Davis and Admiral Conway. 

## Underground Development Facilities

Similarly, plans made for massive underground facilities connected to major bases on both coasts by high speed tunnels.  

US Military continues to identify and monitor underground alien bases / cities. 

## Bases on the Moon(s) and Beyond

Designs are advanced for a Navy base on the moon. Planned as a city / base for 2,000 personnel, including all aspects of a long-term human colony. 

Similar plans are drawn up for  other planets in our solar system, their moons, and the planets of other star systems, and their moons. 

# The Albert Bender Men In Black Encounters (1953)

**Summary:**  
Albert Bender’s encounters with the Men in Black are among the first documented instances of this mysterious phenomenon. Bender, the founder of the International Flying Saucer Bureau (IFSB), claimed he was visited by three strange men dressed in black, who telepathically warned him to abandon his UFO research. This chilling interaction led to the sudden closure of his organization and left an indelible mark on UFO lore, solidifying the Men in Black as a sinister force linked to UFO secrecy.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Albert Bender case is a cornerstone of the Men in Black narrative, establishing many of the now-familiar characteristics of these enigmatic figures. It also raises questions about the nature of UFO suppression and the potential involvement of non-human entities in silencing researchers.

## 1953 Douglas Advanced Design Confirms Operation on Earth of Interplanetary Alien Craft and Highly Advanced Extraterrestrial Beings

After years of extensive study, Douglas Advanced Design again confirms that UFOs were interplanetary spacecraft, operated by highly advanced extraterrestrial beings. 

"Specifically, we resolved that they were the greatest threat our planet had ever faced."

[[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]] came to the same conclusion. 

## Civilian Saucer Investigation Raided and Disbanded

[[Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI)]] had been composed of highly qualified engineers from aerospace industry. 

Douglas, Lockheed, North American, Northrop, CalTech, and JPL, or representatives therefrom, are also stated to have been involved in the CSI study.

Led by Dr. Walter Riedel of NAA. 

They examined well over 1,600 eyewitness reports and case files. 

Via Ruppelt, the CSI eventually informed the Air Force that they had determined that UFOs were real, that humans were controlled by aliens, and that the aliens appeared to be a significant threat to our planet. 

The Air Force did not want the intelligence leaking. 

Winter of 1953, someone (likely the Air Force) stole / confiscated their files, and the group was told to disband, no questions asked. 

Later, whenever the topic of CSI is brought up in Douglas meetings, conversation is abruptly cut short. 

## A Dark Government Scheme

After the disbanding, file-confiscation, and silencing CSI, associated with public denial of alien phenomena and threat by the Air Force despite being the most knowledgeable of it, participants in the secret programs increasingly feel caught up in dark government conspiracy puppeted by invisible masters. 

## The Galactic Federation of Planets 

Jacques Vallee discloses knowledge of the Federation of Planets - a galactic governing force. 

The Think Tank begins to surmise that the galactic federation apparently operates and controls ~60 stars in the near sector of the galaxy. 

Governance is non-democratic, similar to an aristocratic hierarchy. 

## 1953 - President Eisenhower Meets With Aliens 

In 1953, President Eisenhower is reported to have met with alien representatives in a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base. 

The aliens are apparently deviating from the pact made with Truman. 

Eisenhower attempts to make the aliens live up to the pact made with Truman, and is brushed off / dismissed. 

## The Robertson Panel (1953)

## The 1954 European UFO Wave

**Summary:**  
The 1954 European UFO Wave was an intense series of UFO sightings reported across Europe, particularly in France, during the autumn of 1954. Witnesses described an array of phenomena, including luminous discs, cigar-shaped craft, and close encounters with humanoid beings. This wave marked one of the most concentrated and diverse flurries of UFO activity in modern history, captivating the public and sparking widespread media coverage.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The 1954 European UFO Wave represents one of the most documented and varied clusters of UFO sightings, involving thousands of witnesses from multiple countries. The events contributed significantly to the development of UFOlogy in Europe and introduced close-encounter cases that remain central to discussions of extraterrestrial activity.

See [[The 1954 European UFO Wave]]  
## 1954 - The Threat Intensifies 

In the mid 1950s, the pressure of the massive-yet-unknown threats intensifies. 

[[Military Industrial Complex]] secretly working to design massive starship fleets to combat hostile alien battle groups. 

It is believed that massive mother ships, possibly two miles long, are operating between the moon and mars supporting alien UFO operations on and under the Earth. 

Klemperer believes that some of the alien forces may be from a star system near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. 
## More Missile Interference

Additional information is surfacing on the unknown beams being used to distort missile testing at White Sands. 

Photographic evidence shows small discs tracking missiles on ~20% of the flights. 

Mission test programs being continually blocked and interfered with in multiple ways by alien forces, slowing progress. 

During the final phase of Kwajelein Island Nike Zeus test program, missiles being interfered with an prevented from intercepting ICBMs launched from Vanderberg. 

Film from theodolite cameras showing alien space projectiles pushing Zeus missiles off trajectory. 

Interference continues *at least through 2005* into launch failures of Star Wars missiles (updated configuration of Zeus). 

Long before Reagan proposed Star Wars program in the 70s, interceptions were successfully being undertaken (1950s), before interference accelerates. 

## Klemperer's Unconventional Propulsion Schemes MTM-622 

"The Bible" for the secret Douglas Think Tank is [[Dr. Klemperer’s Unconventional Propulsion Schemes]] MTM-622 Reports.

This is regarded by some as potentially the comprehensive proof of extraterrestrial involvement and interference information on the planet. 

1,442 primarily German imports apparently end up working with Klemperer on the schemes. 

Many individuals all over the planet are reportedly receiving similar information (telepathically) and become passionately or desperately impelled to work on electromagnetic anti-gravity propulsion to get off the planet.

The study of MTM-622 reveals to Douglas Think Tank the vast array of potential extraterrestrial threats from multiple alien civilizations, requiring the highest priority need to conceive the most capable intergalactic battle force ever created. 

## Northrop's Extraterrestrial Involvement 

Extraterrestrial involvement between Northrop Grumman and the extraterrestrials is openly known and discussed in the Douglas Think Tank. 
## 1954 - Designs For a One Mile Long Transport Vehicle 

Plans are drawn up in the Douglas Think Tank for a one mile long space transport vehicle, among many others for the galactic Navy. 
## 1955 - The Flying Saucer Conspiracy

In 1955, Major Keyhoe publishes a second book called *The Flying Saucer Conspiracy*, shifting his focus of concern from the flying saucers, to the secret silence group in the government orchestrating the conspiracy to conceal the information from the public. 

The book featured the possible discovery of an orbiting space base or "moon base", and incorporated information on the Bermuda Triangle disappearances. 

## The Hopkinsville Goblins Incident (1955)

**Summary:**  
The Hopkinsville Goblins Incident, also known as the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter, is a highly unusual and widely reported case of alleged alien contact and possible attack. On the night of August 21, 1955, in rural Kelly, Kentucky, the Sutton family and their friend Billy Ray Taylor claimed to have been besieged by small, glowing, humanoid beings after witnessing a bright object land nearby. The creatures, described as “goblins,” displayed strange movements and seemed impervious to gunfire. The event lasted several hours and was investigated by law enforcement and military personnel. It remains one of the most compelling and bizarre UFO cases on record.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Hopkinsville Goblins Incident is notable for its detailed witness accounts, physical evidence, and the prolonged nature of the encounter. It also introduced the term "little green men" into popular culture and has become a classic example of high-strangeness phenomena involving UFOs and humanoid entities.

## 1955 – Aviation Week Publishes on Electrogravitics

Aviation Week published articles on electrogravitics, reporting that leading aerospace companies were investigating the technology for military applications.

**Military Involvement**: Allegations arose that electrogravitic principles were secretly tested in classified projects.

## 1950s – Project Winterhaven

- A U.S. Air Force program explored using electrogravitics for silent aircraft propulsion.
- Allegedly, these efforts intersected with reverse-engineering UFO technology.

## 1950s - Unconventional Aircraft Patents

- _Paul Hill's Work (1950s)_: NASA engineer Paul Hill documented how electrogravitic propulsion could replicate observed UFO behavior. His book, _Unconventional Flying Objects_, provides detailed analysis.

# RAF Bentwaters UFO Incident (1956)

**Summary:**  
The RAF Bentwaters UFO Incident of August 13, 1956, involved a dramatic UFO encounter over one of the UK’s most strategically significant military installations during the height of the Cold War. Multiple radar operators at RAF Bentwaters and nearby RAF Lakenheath tracked an unidentified object performing extraordinary maneuvers at speeds far exceeding conventional aircraft. Witnesses on the ground and in the air corroborated the sightings, with some describing near-collision experiences. Despite being heavily documented, the incident remains officially unexplained, cementing its place as one of the most compelling UFO cases of the era.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The RAF Bentwaters Incident stands out for its combination of radar tracking, visual confirmation by military personnel, and interactions with interceptor aircraft. The case demonstrates the inability of military technology to match the performance of unidentified craft, highlighting the phenomenon's implications for national security.

See [[RAF Bentwaters UFO Incident (1956)]]  
## 1956 - A Moon Base and An Interplanetary Network of Sensors

In 1956, Army Lieutenant General Arthur Trudeau, Director of Army Research and Development, former commander of Army Intelligence, develops a proposal called Project Horizon, designed to place a based on the Moon. 

Proposal also included study major antenna communications sensor facilities on other planets and their moons. 

Note that this is 5 years before JFK's public presentation in 1961 of the plan to go to the moon, that was later known as the Apollo Program. 
## Unsolicited Proposals

Many of these types of advanced systems designs from Douglas Think Tank and other groups fed into unsolicited proposals submitted to the US Military for funding.  

Funding usually flowed, long before the official government programs became public. 

## More Alien Assistance From the White Hat Aliens to Combat the Black Hat Aliens

A strange new language of White Hat Aliens and Black Hat Aliens emerges around the planet, from California Engineers to Indigenous Wisdom Keepers. 

Perhaps in emerges in one place and spreads. Perhaps not. 

Around the world, it becomes apparent to those experientially engaged in interactions with extraterrestrials that there are [[White Hat]] aliens helping a network of humans develop spacecraft and spacecraft carriers to help their space battle groups combat the [[Black Hat]] aliens that are exploiting and enslaving the Earth. 

This assistance to aid individuals in developing vehicles and unconventional propulsions systems to get off the planet and out to the stars apparently dates back at least to the 1930s, and is documented extensively in Klemperer's "Bible" of Unconventional Propulsion Schemes. 

## Lockheed Skunk Works 

Lockheed Skunk Works, a division of Lockheed Martin, is renowned for pioneering classified aerospace projects, including the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 Nighthawk. Allegations of extraterrestrial reverse-engineering have surrounded Skunk Works for decades, fueled by comments from its key personnel including Ben Rich.

## 1957 - Years Into Advanced Research On Unconventional Propulsion and Space Warfare at Douglas 

Douglas is not 7 years into research and concepts around Dr. Klemperer's unconventional propulsion schemes. 

Numerous spaceships have been designed around those schemes, with the Aim of interstellar travel and battle. 

Designs include vehicles 40x larger than the Apollo Saturn vehicles, built to wage interstellar warfare. 

This galactic navy was being designed in response to incoming floods of information suggesting that for millennia, extremely advanced extraterrestrial beings had been building space battleships / motherships, now parked in our orbit, which posed an existential threat to humanity and the planet. 

By now, it was believed by some of those involved that we were dealing with multiple warring alien militaries, who controlled at least hundreds of thousands of planets, and who had been controlling humanity and warring for control of our planet, continually, for thousands of years.

## A Warning System Incoming Attack 

A system of receiving antennas was designed to cover our planet to create a system for detecting incoming alien attack, and notify the ballistic missile defense systems that were under design. 

Note that trees may also be able to be used for this purpose, and that organic matter can relay signals biologically.

The wave reached its peak on March 24, 1983, when over 300 reports of a single craft flooded local police stations. The Hudson Valley sightings remain a hallmark of mass UFO sightings, characterized by structured craft, consistent descriptions, and advanced aerial behavior.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Hudson Valley UFO Wave highlights the persistence of mass sightings involving structured, silent craft. The scale of the reports, coupled with the credibility of witnesses—including pilots, law enforcement officers, and professionals—makes it one of the most compelling UFO cases of modern times.

## The Trans-en-Provence Case (1981)

**Summary:**  
The Trans-en-Provence Case is one of the most scientifically analyzed UFO incidents in history. On January 8, 1981, a farmer in Trans-en-Provence, France, reported observing a metallic, saucer-shaped craft that landed briefly on his property before taking off at incredible speed. The incident left physical traces on the ground, including scorched vegetation and soil depressions, which were extensively studied by French government investigators. The findings revealed anomalies in soil and plant samples, suggesting exposure to high heat and electromagnetic radiation, making this case a cornerstone in UFO research.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Trans-en-Provence Case stands out for its detailed physical evidence and scientific investigation. The incident was officially examined by France's national space agency (CNES) under its UFO division, GEIPAN, lending credibility and rigor to its findings. It is a rare example of a UFO case where physical evidence has been scientifically documented and analyzed.

See [[The Trans-en-Provence Case (1981)]]  
## April 9, 1983 - Air Force Document Describing Genetic Origins of Human Species 

On April 9, 1983, Linda Moulton Howe is taken to a US Air Force base, where she is shown a top secret document from a government program, including the following

- "These EBEs manipulated DNA in already evolving primates to create homo sapiens" 
    
- "All questions and mysteries about the evolution of homo sapiens have been answered and this project is closed."

Later, in 1999, another Defense Intelligence Agency employee would confirm additional details. 

# The Copley Woods Encounter (1983)

**Summary:**  
The Copley Woods Encounter is a haunting UFO and alien interaction case that blurs the line between extraterrestrial phenomena and paranormal experiences. On June 30, 1983, in Copley Woods, Indiana, Debra "Debbie" Jordan-Kauble experienced an extraordinary series of events involving a glowing craft, humanoid entities, and missing time. The encounter, which included telepathic communication and an examination aboard the craft, left physical evidence in the form of burns, radiation exposure, and unusual markings on the ground. The case gained prominence after being investigated and documented by Budd Hopkins in _Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods._

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Copley Woods Encounter stands out for its physical evidence, emotional depth, and connection to the larger phenomenon of alien abduction. Debbie Jordan-Kauble’s experiences provide a striking example of the overlap between alien encounters and high-strangeness phenomena, challenging the boundaries of UFO research.

## 1980s Reverse Engineering Projects at Area 51 

Reverse engineering projects ongoing at area 51. 

- Insiders like Bob Lazar claimed that government contracts, including some involving Lockheed, were dedicated to reverse-engineering alien propulsion systems.
- Claims include attempts to replicate anti-gravity systems utilizing _Element 115_, a theorized material with extraordinary energy properties.

At Area S-4 employees involved report personally seeing at least 9 alien craft in military possession in this particular hangar, all different shapes and sizes. 

Government briefings state that at least one is from an *archeological excavation*, implying that it is ancient. 

(Note - Jordan has personally received first hand reports of experience with physical craft that thousands of years old, *and still functioning*.) 

Employee reports experience with a small reactor from a craft the size of a basketball, which produced an anti-gravitational field. When activated it was impossible to touch (like the poles of a magnet). Despite channeling incredible load, it never rose to above ambient temperature, which is impossible according to current human understanding of physics. 

Projects underway to attempt to reverse engineer the alien technology with available materials. 

Massive issue trying to reverse engineer alien technology, with non-alien material science. 

As of 80s still no idea how technologies work. "Like putting a nuclear reactor back in Victorian times." "we have no idea how the physics operate... and the power levels... are astronomical."

Projects are hyper-siloed and compartmentalized to prevent leaks, and to prevent anyone from obtaining the full picture. Buddy system with teams of two working on tiny segments of the whole, and only able to talk to their partner. Drastically slows scientific progress. 

There had been a string of scientists going back in each compartmentalized project... 

Crafts do not operate electrically. There is no wiring to connect any of the sub-components, they just have to be in the vicinity. (Reference Tesla, wireless energy transmission). 

Reference Westinghouse shutting wireless energy down. Reference, electricity cartel and meters. If the cartel couldn't meter it, didn't want the public to have it. 

Horrific accidents and deaths occur with programs to attempt to explore completely unknown alien technologies and energy sources, up to and including "unannounced nuclear tests" that killed employees. 

Siloed projects relating to: 
- Metalurgy  
- Propulsion systems 
- Power systems 
- Project Galileo 
- Project Sidekick - weapons potentials 
- Project Looking Glass - effects on Time  
- etc. 

Briefing documents indicate that at least one of the craft is from the Zeta Reticuli ZR3 (third planet in Zeta Reticuli star system), located about 39 [[Light Years]] / 12 [[Parsecs]] from Earth. 

Note that the Zeta Reticulans, or Greys, are often associated with this star system. 

## Fuel Element 115 

The group at Area S-4 of Area 51 discovers that the reactors are powered by a very heavy fuel element 115 (atomic number 115) that was not on the periodic table of elements as of the 1980s. 

It was first synthesized by a joint team of Russian and American scientists in 2003, before being recognized as one of four new elements in 2015. 

The synthesized version known to human is radioactive. The version that powers the crafts is stable and does not decay / does not emit radioactivity. (many elements have both unstable isotopes and stable isotopes). 

## Area S-4 Craft 

Craft is dark pewter color with no right angles. Often reported as no seams either. Every looks like hardened melted wax, everything solidly fused, no seams. Everything curved. No control panels, no bathroom, no decoration. 

Three seats around the reactor that sits in the middle. 

American's had learned how to cautiously pilot and communicate with the craft via radio. Employees watch test flights, and witness test flights with coworkers and others. Craft produces corona discharge (blueish glow) as lifting off, slight hissing sound. Once craft is 5 to 10 feet off the ground, hissing stops, glow disappears, hovers silently. 

There is a waveguide that goes from the reactor up to the top, and a small appendage sticking out of the top of the craft. This produces a heart-shaped gravitational distortion around the craft. If you are underneath the craft, you cannot see it because the anti-gravity bends the light. 

The anti-gravitational envelope essentially separates the craft from its surrounding spatiotemporal reality, so that it is unimpeded by gravity, inertia, etc. 

Some of the (metal) can become transparent (frequently reported with craft). 

3 levels: under the reactors are the rectangular gravity / anti-gravity amplifiers, under them are the gravity emitters. 

Craft roughly 52 feet in diameter, seats obviously designed for sub-human size (matching the description of Greys from [[Zeta Reticuli]]). 

All 9 crafts appear to use the same Unconventional Propulsion Systems. 

Government later does a land grab and expands the forbidden territory around Area 51 and Papoose Lake. 

Russian scientists are welcomed to and collaborating with American scientists at Area 51, until a significant American breakthrough / discovery, after which the Russian scientists are not allowed to return. 

## Gravity Waves

Researchers at S-4 posit based on this technology that gravity might be a wave. 

Not formalized scientifically until 2016. 

Note that Jordan has been personally informed by those with direct experience that alien craft operate on gravitational waves. "The real trouble is slowing down."

Note that the UFOs, like galaxies, appear to rotate and travel along the direction of travel belly first. 

## The Voronezh UFO Landing, Russia (1989)

**Summary:**  
The Voronezh UFO Landing is one of the most extraordinary and well-documented UFO encounters in modern history. On September 27, 1989, in the city of Voronezh, Russia, multiple eyewitnesses, including children and adults, reported seeing a large, glowing craft land in a local park. Allegedly, strange humanoid beings emerged, including a towering figure and a smaller robot-like entity, interacting briefly with the onlookers. The incident garnered significant media attention, including official acknowledgment from the Soviet news agency TASS, making it a landmark case in UFO history.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Voronezh UFO Landing stands out for its numerous eyewitnesses, the apparent physical evidence left behind, and the unprecedented involvement of official Soviet reporting. The case provides a rare blend of close encounters, humanoid sightings, and material traces, sparking global interest and debate about extraterrestrial contact.

## 1989 – Belgian UFO Wave 
 
 Triangular UFOs are witnessed by thousands, verified and tracked by military radar.
## 1989 - George Knapp and Senator Harry Reid Begin Three Decade Relationship

Investigative reporter George Knapp begins hearing stories, and opens two way dialogue with Senator Harry Reid that leads to George Knapp obtaining compelling information. 

George also meets Robert Bigelow, who spends tens of millions of dollars on UFO investigations. 

In 1996, Bigelow creates the National Institute for Discovery Science with a highly credible board of academics, two former astronauts who had walked the moon, and scientists who had worked with US Military. 

Reid and Bigelow meet, helping pave the way for a congressional inquiry 27 years later in ~2023. 

## Russian Investigations 

George Knapp interviewed more than a dozen military officials and scientists in Russia with knowledge of UFO matters in USSR during the Cold War. Russians conducted at least a ten year study, accumulating thousands of case files. Program Director was Col. Boris Sokolov. 

Sokolov reported ~45 incidents in which Russian warplanes had engaged UFOs and attempted to chase or shoot them. In all incidents the pursuits were unsuccesful, with the UFOs shooting away at seemingly impossible speeds or disabling the warplanes. 

Sokolov reported that like the US, Russia then instructed the military to leave the UFOs alone due to their "incredible capacities for retaliation."

Sokolov also reported a case in which UFOs appeared at a Russian ICBM base in Ukraine... the aliens took control of the launch control systems, fired up missiles aimed at the United States, entered launch control codes, and then shut the launch control system down and disappeared. World War IV averted.

## The Japan Airlines 1628 UFO Encounter (1986)

**Summary:**  
The Japan Airlines 1628 UFO Encounter is one of the most documented and credible UFO sightings, involving an experienced airline crew and corroborated by radar data. On November 17, 1986, Captain Kenju Terauchi, a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours, and his crew reported a massive unidentified craft shadowing their Boeing 747 cargo plane over Alaska, along with two smaller craft. The larger craft was described as larger than an aircraft carrier and emitted bright, pulsating lights. The craft followed him for 40 minutes, staying with him even after significant evasive maneuvers. Despite being tracked by FAA and military radar, the incident was dismissed by authorities, sparking controversy and enduring intrigue.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
This case stands out for its combination of eyewitness testimony, radar confirmation, and a highly credible primary witness in Captain Terauchi. The incident is often cited as a textbook example of official obfuscation, raising questions about government transparency regarding UFO encounters.

# The Ilkley Moor Encounter (1987)

**Summary:**  
The Ilkley Moor Encounter is one of the most enigmatic alien abduction cases in the United Kingdom. On December 1, 1987, retired police officer Philip Spencer was walking across Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire when he saw a small, humanoid being with an oversized head and long arms. Spencer managed to photograph the entity before it disappeared. He then experienced a period of missing time, during which he recalled being taken aboard a craft and shown vivid images of environmental destruction. The encounter is notable for the physical evidence of a photograph, the missing time, and Spencer’s subsequent physiological effects.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Ilkley Moor Encounter blends physical evidence—a rare photograph of an alleged alien—with classic elements of abduction phenomena, including missing time and environmental messaging. It remains one of the UK’s most compelling UFO cases, drawing attention to the phenomenon’s complexity and implications.

See [[The Ilkley Moor Encounter (1987)]]  

## The Gulf Breeze UFO Sightings (1987)

**Summary:**  
The Gulf Breeze UFO sightings of 1987 are among the most debated and well-documented UFO cases in history. Originating in Gulf Breeze, Florida, local resident Ed Walters published photographs of disk-shaped craft emitting beams of light, sparking widespread interest and controversy. Over the following months, hundreds of independent sightings were reported in the area, including accounts of low-flying craft and strange aerial maneuvers. 

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Gulf Breeze UFO sightings are significant for their impact on UFO culture, the extensive photographic evidence, and the large number of corroborative witnesses. Despite skepticism, the case remains a cornerstone example of mass UFO sightings and the challenges of verifying photographic evidence.

See [[The Gulf Breeze UFO Sightings (1987)]]  
## 1987 - John Lear Speaks Out 

For 16 years from 1967 to 1983, John Lear (of Learjet family) flies planes for the CIA. During his career, sets multiple flight records. 

In 1987, Lear reports that the US government has close contacts with extraterrestrials, and that government is promoting films like _[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T.:_The_Extra-Terrestrial "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial")_ and _[Close Encounters of the Third Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind "Close Encounters of the Third Kind")_ to influence the public to see extraterrestrials as "space brothers". He further discusses  the [Majestic 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12 "Majestic 12"), and a US government treaty with [Gray aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_alien "Grey alien"), which later goes awry. 

The statement exposes a government coverup dating back to the 40s, German interactions with alien technologies back to the 30s, and military investigations into the [Ghost rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_rockets "Ghost rockets") of Sweden. 

Lear cites a "total, thorough and sweeping cover-up to include the use of 'deadly force'."

He further references the 1952 UFO incidents, a 1964 meeting with aliens at Holloman Air Force Base, government sanctioned alien abductions, alien implants, and alien-human hybrids. He associates UFOs with child abductions, cattle mutilations, and human mutilations. He further talks about a military confrontation at underground alien Dulce Base that results in 66 human casualties. 

Lear was interviewed by TV journalist [George Knapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Knapp_(television_journalist) "George Knapp (television journalist)").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lear#cite_note-32). 

He reports that government has retrieved between 10 and 15 flying saucers, some in perfect condition, and has attempted to fly some of them. 

He reports that they have between 30 and 50 alien bodies in cryogenic storage, representing at least 5 to 10 distinct civilizations. 

He reads from an Air Force book forthrightly describing multiple types of aliens. 

We are unable to duplicate any of the metals of any of the craft. 

We are unable to figure out how they are propelled. 

At least 90% of them are hostile. (This matches [[Jordan]]'s [[Current Best Understanding]] as of time of writing).

He does not believe that Presidents are being given the full briefing. 

Says that top group that controls this is a top group of military and scientists know as [[MAJESTIC-12]] / MJ-12. 

President Reagan "Is not this alien force already among us?"

President Carter "I am convinced that UFOs exist because I saw one."  

Cites genetic tinkering / engineering of human race by alien forces between 4,000 and 8,000 BC. 

Books - Intruders, Communion. 

A friend of John's has done 140 of 300 abduction hypnosis cases. People abducted, taken into a saucer, poked, proded, experimented with, samples taken, etc. Memory is then wiped, and they are sent back. 

Says that over 100,000 people have been given instructions on what to do in case of certain large scale events, that hypnotic techniques cannot recover. 

Intruders by Bud Hopkins, cross-breeding and genetic engineering. 

November 17, 1986 Japanese Airlines incident Iceland to Alaska. Mother ship twice the size of an aircraft carrier. 

"You can't imagine what pressure these people are under to cover this stuff up."

In 1989, John Lear introduces Bob Lazar to George Knapp. 

## Leonard Stringfield 

Works in Air Force on UFOs, then continues private research.

## Linda Moulton Howe Documentary - A Strange Harvest

Later interviewed by Danny Sheehan  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Moulton_Howe  

1975 to 1980 - at least 9,000 cattle mutilations. 

Police investigations document cuts with laser beams far sharper than anything we have. According to John Lear police determined in some cases they actually laser cut *between the cells.* without cutting the cells themselves.

Most mutilations are accompanied by sightings of UFOs, or strange lights.

## Bob Lazar's Area 51 Testimonies

**Summary:**  
Bob Lazar’s testimonies about his work at a site near Area 51, known as S-4, remain some of the most controversial and influential claims in UFO history. In 1989, Lazar publicly stated that he worked as a physicist on advanced propulsion systems derived from extraterrestrial technology. He described hands-on experiences with saucer-like craft, gravity-manipulating propulsion systems, and a mysterious element called "Element 115." Lazar’s revelations introduced Area 51 to popular consciousness and sparked decades of debate about secret government programs and extraterrestrial technology.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
Bob Lazar’s claims are pivotal in UFO lore, offering detailed descriptions of alleged reverse-engineering of alien technology and insider knowledge of secret facilities. Whether viewed as fact or fiction, his testimonies have shaped public perceptions of UFO secrecy and inspired a wave of interest in government cover-ups.

See [[Bob Lazar's Area 51 Testimonies]]  
## The Kalahari Desert UFO Crash (1989)

**Summary:**  
The Kalahari Desert UFO Crash of May 7, 1989, is one of the most dramatic UFO incidents involving alleged military engagement, the crash of a UFO, and the recovery of extraterrestrial beings. The event reportedly began when South African fighter jets intercepted an unidentified craft violating airspace, forcing it to crash in the Kalahari Desert. The craft was described as a metallic disc, and witnesses claim that alien occupants were recovered, one of whom was injured. The case has gained notoriety due to whistleblower testimonies and leaked government documents, although its authenticity remains hotly debated.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Kalahari Desert UFO Crash is significant for its elements of direct military involvement, extraterrestrial recovery, and alleged international secrecy. If true, the case provides compelling evidence of a global effort to conceal extraterrestrial encounters and recover alien technology.

See [[The Kalahari Desert UFO Crash (1989)]]  
## The Belgium UFO Wave (1989–1990)

**Summary:**  
The Belgium UFO Wave refers to a series of highly credible UFO sightings that occurred from late 1989 through early 1990, involving thousands of witnesses, military personnel, and law enforcement. The most notable events included reports of massive, triangular-shaped craft with bright lights moving silently across the sky. The sightings peaked on the night of March 30–31, 1990, when Belgian Air Force F-16 jets scrambled to intercept one of these objects, which displayed extraordinary flight maneuvers recorded on radar. Despite extensive investigations, no conventional explanation has been provided, and the events remain a hallmark of modern UFO phenomena.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Belgium UFO Wave is significant for its combination of mass civilian sightings, corroboration by law enforcement and military radar, and the involvement of the Belgian Air Force. The events highlighted the limitations of contemporary aviation technology in confronting advanced aerial phenomena and added to the growing credibility of UFO encounters in the modern era.

See [[The Belgium UFO Wave (1989–1990)]] 

# The Skinwalker Ranch Phenomena (1990s–Present)

**Summary:**  
Skinwalker Ranch, located in northeastern Utah, is infamous for its history of unexplained phenomena, ranging from UFO sightings and [[Cryptids]] to [[Poltergeist]] activity and cattle mutilations. Dubbed "the strangest place on Earth," the 512-acre property became a focal point for paranormal investigations after a series of events in the 1990s involving the Sherman family, who reported disturbing encounters with unknown entities. Subsequent investigations by private organizations, including the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) and, later, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), documented high strangeness phenomena that defy conventional explanations. Skinwalker Ranch remains one of the most perplexing and controversial hotspots for UFO and paranormal activity.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
Skinwalker Ranch serves as a unique laboratory for studying the intersection of UFOs, interdimensional phenomena, and paranormal events. Its recurring anomalies challenge our understanding of reality and point to a broader, interconnected phenomenon that transcends traditional UFO encounters.

## 1990s - Hundreds of Abductees Interviewed by Harvard Psychiatrist 

In the early 1990s, Harvard Psychologist John Mack begins an intensive 10 year plus study of 200 individuals who report recurring alien encounters / abductions. 

Later, John Mack is supported in his defense of his findings and methodology by [[Daniel Sheehan]], a leading attorney investigating matters relating to the security state (Pentagon Papers, etc.). 

[[Daniel Sheehan]] subsequently becomes convinced that a massive government conspiracy and coverup of the alien phenomena has occurred, and accelerates efforts to force government disclosure. 

## Early 1990s - Dr. Steven Greer Starts UFO Project

In the early 1990s, Dr. Steven Greer and collaborators start a project relating to UFOs, establish a protocol, and make contact with the objects. 

Military Intelligence and CIA find out about it, and begin inquiry. 

## 1991 - The STS-48 Incident

Footage from the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1991 captured UFOs making abrupt directional changes at high speeds, a behavior inconsistent with known physics.

# The Mexico City Solar Eclipse UFO Sightings (1991)

**Summary:**  
On July 11, 1991, during a total solar eclipse visible over much of Mexico and parts of Central America, hundreds of people across Mexico City reported seeing UFOs in the sky. The event coincided with one of the most anticipated astronomical phenomena of the century, with thousands of observers equipped with cameras and recording devices. Several videos captured unexplained metallic objects hovering in the sky, igniting widespread interest and earning the incident the title "The Cosmic UFO Event."

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Mexico City Solar Eclipse UFO Sightings stand out as one of the most extensively documented UFO events, thanks to the convergence of widespread public attention on the solar eclipse and the accessibility of recording equipment. The case remains a cornerstone in UFOlogy, symbolizing the potential for collective human observation to capture evidence of unexplained phenomena.

See [[The Mexico City Solar Eclipse UFO Sightings (1991)]] 

## 1993 – _The X-Files_

Further shapes public perception of alien conspiracies.

## The Kelly Cahill Encounter (1993)

**Summary:**  
The Kelly Cahill Encounter is one of Australia’s most significant UFO and alien contact cases, marked by multiple witnesses and compelling details. On the evening of August 8, 1993, Kelly Cahill and her husband were driving through the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne when they saw a massive, glowing craft hovering near the road. Kelly reported encountering tall, black, featureless humanoid beings with glowing red eyes. The beings exhibited an overwhelming presence of malevolence, and Kelly later experienced missing time, physical marks on her body, and vivid flashbacks. Other witnesses in the area reported similar sightings, adding corroborative weight to her account.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Kelly Cahill Encounter is notable for its corroborative testimony from multiple unrelated witnesses, physical effects on the experiencer, and vivid descriptions of the beings and craft. The case has become a cornerstone in abduction research, highlighting the psychological and physical aftermath of close encounters.

See [[The Kelly Cahill Encounter (1993)]]  
## 1993 - Key Statements by Ben Rich (1925–1995)**:

**UCLA Engineering Alumni Speech**
    
- Ben Rich, then-retired head of Skunk Works, delivered a presentation in which he famously stated:
	
> _"We now have the technology to take ET home."_
	
- He also implied that breakthroughs in propulsion and energy systems were far beyond what was publicly known, but that they remained classified.
- Rich reportedly said:
	
> _"Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do."_
        
- **Follow-Up Conversations**:
    
    - Rich reportedly clarified in private discussions that advanced propulsion systems, resembling those observed in UFOs, had been developed within classified programs.

## 1994 – Edgar Fouche’s Testimony

- Edgar Fouche, a former aerospace engineer, claimed Lockheed Skunk Works developed the TR-3B, a triangular craft utilizing plasma-based propulsion capable of producing anti-gravity effects.

## 1993 - Dr. Steven Greer Asked to Brief Director of CIA Under Clinton 

Early military, intelligence, and government contacts reveal they are aware of a vast program that has been run illegally outside of the constitutional, congressional, and executive branch confines of US Law. 

By 1993, Greer is invited to brief the director of the CIA.

*Letter reveals that the Clinton administration has made inquiries, and been denied access.*

December 13, 1993, briefs CIA Director, revealing that neither CIA Director nor Clinton has been "read in" to the program. 

Gave rise to Project Starlight, a briefing program for executive branch and eventually members of Congress. 

Subsequently, is invited to brief the next 4 Presidents. 

## Conclusion: Programs Are Unconstitutional, Illegal, and Therefore Have No Protection From The National Security Act 

Dr. Greer and team arrive at the conclusion that the programs are clearly unconstitutional and illegal, and therefore have no protection from the National Security Act (personnel, evidence, documents, etc.)

The legal implication is that they cannot demand to be kept secret if they are going to operate outside of the Constitutional oversight of Congress and the President. 

## Admiral Wilson, Director of Defense Intelligence Agency (Highest Ranking Military Intelligence Officer) Denied Access and Threatened Personally and With Demotion

In addition to Presidents being denied access on the grounds they did not "need to know", Admiral Wisdom, Director of DIA and highest ranking military intelligence officer, made inquiries and was denied access.

## 1994 - John Mack Publishes *Abducted: Human Encounters With Aliens*

John Mack attempts to publish his finding in the New England Journal of Medicine and is rejected. 

Strange for a department chairman at Harvard. 

John responds by strengthening the paper, adding more details, footnotes, etc. and resubmits. 

Two days later, executive assistant for editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine sent to Harvard to John's office saying that his submission had not, and would not, even be opened and reviewed. 

John had already won a Pulitzer Prize, so calls a publisher who agrees to publish it as a book. 

Shortly thereafter, John is pulled into a tribunal at Harvard chaired by editor in chief the New England Journal, with the dean of the medical school, and three other faculty. 

They berated him for harming Harvard by lending credence to these accounts. 

## 1994 - John Mack Retains Daniel Sheehan 

After being brought up in front of a secret tribunal at Harvard for having written his book - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack... 

...John Mack retains Daniel Sheehan to represent him in the midst of the Harvard investigations. 

1994, Harvard tells Sheehan that it would be completely ridiculous to believe there could be other life anywhere in Universe. 

Lawrence Rockefeller agrees to finance a "grand rounds" to present all evidence to Harvard, and that they can bring in chief of FAA, military personnel, police officers, etc. 

Harvard rejects the offer. 

Sheehan later finds out that the United States Air Force, Defense Department, and CIA had been engaged in a decades long campaign / conspiracy / covert program to intimidate / silence / smear people inside military, government, or academia who tried to do anything about the UFO issue. 

Common tactic was to order a psychiatric exam and question mental health. (Note Secretary Forrestal assassination). 

A number of them were sent to Harvard Medical School for a high level exam, and John Mack, chairman of the apartment, was tasked with these highest priority cases. 
## Preparation for the Grand Rounds at Harvard

Daniel Sheehan interviews many people in the field to prepare them to be witnesses at the grand rounds at Harvard. 

Sheehan interviews experiences in John Mack's book, along with Stanton Friedman, Bud Hopkins, David Jacobs, Steven Greer, Linda Molton Howe, and most of the main figures. 

## Project For Extraordinary Experience Research

John Mack founds a peer group called Project For Extraordinary Experience Research at Cambridge. 

Daniel Sheehan becomes legal council. 

Some experiences relate to extraterrestrial beings here on earth.

- **Role:** Noted French researcher in astrophysics and plasma physics.
- **Revelation:** Shared evidence of advanced propulsion systems resembling those described in UFO encounters. Petit argued that such technology likely originated from extraterrestrial sources and had been suppressed by world governments.
- Dr. Petit offered compelling testimony about advanced propulsion systems that mirrored the capabilities of UFOs reported globally. As an expert in plasma physics, Petit described how electromagnetic fields could theoretically create propulsion without traditional fuel or exhaust, a concept seemingly validated by UFO flight characteristics. Petit also speculated that these technologies were far beyond human engineering capabilities, suggesting extraterrestrial origins. He called for greater scientific collaboration to understand these phenomena and unlock their potential applications for humanity.

#### **29. Sgt. Michael W. Smith (USAF Radar Operator)**

- **Role:** Former radar operator in the U.S. Air Force.
- **Revelation:** Testified about tracking UFOs on radar, which exhibited flight patterns and speeds beyond the capabilities of known aircraft. Smith claimed his unit was instructed to erase records of the incidents.
- Smith described multiple instances where UFOs were tracked on military radar performing maneuvers that defied known physics. In one case, a craft appeared to accelerate to hypersonic speeds, then stop abruptly and change direction without any deceleration. Smith explained that these sightings were not isolated incidents but occurred frequently enough to be discussed informally among radar operators. However, any formal acknowledgment of these events was strictly forbidden, with records often being erased or classified. Smith emphasized that the intelligence behind these objects appeared deliberate and advanced.

#### **30. Dr. Steven Lovekin (Army Signal Corps)**

- **Role:** Former member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps.
- **Revelation:** Provided details about classified communications relating to UFOs. Lovekin claimed that Eisenhower was aware of extraterrestrial activity and was deeply concerned about maintaining control over the situation.
- Lovekin shared his experiences working in classified communications within the Army Signal Corps, where he encountered numerous references to extraterrestrial activity. He claimed that President Eisenhower was fully briefed on UFO incidents and expressed concern about the lack of civilian oversight in managing these encounters. Lovekin described hearing discussions about the potential for reverse-engineering alien technology, which could revolutionize energy and transportation. He also noted that efforts to control the narrative around UFOs were already deeply entrenched by the mid-20th century.

## 2004 - Tic Tac Nimitz Incident 

**Summary:**  
The 2004 USS _Nimitz_ UFO encounters, commonly referred to as the "Tic Tac" incident, involved highly credible sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) by Navy personnel. Over several days in November 2004, the USS _Princeton_ tracked anomalous craft with extraordinary speed, agility, and transmedium capabilities. Fighter pilots from the USS _Nimitz_, including Navy Aviator Commander David Fravor, observed the Tic Tac-shaped craft up close during a 6-minute engagement. The object demonstrated advanced technology far beyond any known human capabilities. This event, corroborated by radar, pilot testimony, and video evidence, represents a cornerstone in modern UFO investigations, sparking public and governmental interest worldwide.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The USS _Nimitz_ encounters exemplify the technological superiority of unidentified craft, their apparent interest in military operations, and the inability of current defense systems to match their capabilities. The incident gained unprecedented attention with the Pentagon’s declassification of video evidence and testimony from high-ranking military officials before U.S. Congress.

## 2007 - 2008 - Stephenville "Mothership "Texas Mass UFO Citing

**Summary:**  
The Stephenville UFO Sightings refer to a series of highly publicized encounters in and around Stephenville, Texas, beginning in January 2008. Witnesses, including experienced pilots, law enforcement officers, and dozens of residents, reported seeing enormous, silent crafts with bright lights performing extraordinary maneuvers and speeds in the sky. The event gained national attention due to its compelling witness accounts, radar data suggesting unidentified objects, and proximity to President George W. Bush’s Crawford Ranch. Despite explanations attributing the sightings to military exercises, the case remains one of the most credible and well-documented UFO events of the 21st century.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
The Stephenville UFO Sightings are significant for their credible witnesses, corroborating radar evidence, and military involvement. They exemplify the enduring mystery of UFO phenomena and highlight the tension between public accounts and official explanations.

## Inspector General Brings In Other Military Officers - Lies Exposed 

Inspector General starts bringing in officers, who they are able to brief on what is going on. 

Previously even the guy who was J2 head of intelligence for Joint Chiefs of Staff was briefed out of this. Not allowed to ask any questions. And he was head of intelligence for Joint Chiefs of Staff to US President. 

Now Congress and multiple high ranking military officers are becoming aware that the fascist deep state is embezzling billions of dollars from government and tax payers, lying to congress, lying to high ranking military officials, lying to the US Public. 

They view the elected representatives as temporary employees that come and go, in the midst of a long overarching plot, including the Presidents, and they hold them in disdain. 

What does that mean from a constitutional standpoint.

Senate Intelligence Committee now has the DNA tests showing that the bodies are non-human. 

Fravor reports that the UFO he encountered defied the laws of physics as we understand them. 

As of 2024, over *40* top secret additional witnesses have given corroborative sworn testimony under oath to the Senate Intelligence Committee. 

# David Grusch's Whistleblower Testimony (2023)

**Summary:**  
In 2023, David Grusch, a decorated U.S. Air Force veteran and intelligence officer, came forward as a whistleblower with explosive allegations about secretive government programs related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Grusch claimed the U.S. government has been operating clandestine projects involving recovered extraterrestrial craft, some of which contained non-human biologics. His testimony, delivered during a historic congressional hearing, sent shockwaves through the public, scientific, and political spheres. Grusch described a decades-long cover-up, involving misappropriation of funds, intimidation of witnesses, and non-disclosure to elected officials.

---

**Why It Matters:**  
Grusch’s testimony represents one of the most credible and high-profile whistleblower accounts in modern UFO history. His assertions, supported by corroborating witnesses and classified documents, reignited debates about government transparency and humanity's understanding of its place in the universe.

See [[David Grusch's Whistleblower Testimony (2023)]]  
## 2023 - David Hecker Testifies to AARO and Senate Intelligence Committee Under Oath Regarding Antarctica, Directed Weapons Systems, etc. 

David Hecker. Raytheon Polar Services. Operating under NSF. Dual role plumbing and fire control at South Pole Station. In that role educated on every room and function, electrical systems, equipment, etc. 

Testifies to congress regarding the existence of above top secret facilities and the existence secret Directed Energy Weapons Systems, operating under the pretenses of civilian science. ELF (Extra Low Frequency) system energized and functioning. Ice Cube Nutrino Detector.

Presently worlds "biggest telescope", and indications they want to increase it 10x more. Also capable of directed energy weaponization. Original build was perhaps $500 Billion... why 10x? 

These systems are capable of being networked together to create super weapons. 

States that a small technocratic elite that controls the technologies are weaponizing them against the human beings who financed their R&D with tax dollars, sweat, and blood. Many people experiencing "Havana Syndrome" type symptoms, up to and including mass mind control. Walking wounded getting hit with them every day. 

For example - Raytheon makes "Active Denial System" - weapons grade microwave Directed Energy Weapon for crowd control. Humvee mounted small scale... Possible satellite mounted large scale. Available to highest bidder, black market, etc. 

Cites large scale laser that shoots into space. 

Cites multiple HARP systems... HARP is an ionospheric heaters... Controlling environment of the people whose minds you are controlling. 

Air Force Document - discussing that Air Force would have full control of the weather by mid 2020s. Very easy to manufacture fires, natural disasters, earthquakes, etc. via directed energy weapons systems. 

States that major earthquake in New Zealand was "friendly fire" from the directed energy weapons platform. 

"We are all under attack every day by their new invisible weapons." Everyone needs to understand the weapons on the playing field. 

"If the technology exists, someone is using it."

Is hand and hand work with alien intelligence happening? Presidential deals with ET forces? Dulce base? "I think it is so obvious to say yes". "A lot of factions on planet. A lot of factions off planet." 

Truman Show Reality. It should be terrifying. The whole world is about to get sucker punched by technology, and they have no clue. 

Admiral Bird - Operation High Jump.

Continent of Antarctica has as massive of waterways as other continents, under the ice. Routes for submarines. What were Nazis doing during WWII, post WWII, where did submarine fleet go, etc. 

10+ year lag in science meeting public awareness. 

Key technologies continually buried. Tesla, wireless energy, reverse engineered alien technology, etc. 

Absolute government lies. We the people are being lied to. Congress is being lied to. There is a military industrial complex situation that crosses national boundaries. "I see in 5 years an enslaved population that will do whatever they are told."

KNOW THYSELF. 
## Government Contact With Extraterrestrials 

When asked by Congress if he believes the US Government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials, Grusch states that "is something I cannot discuss in a public setting."
 
## Only 5% Military Pilot Reporting? 

David Grusch tells congress that based on his conversations with pilots, he estimates "we are somewhere near 5% reporting (of military pilot encounters with UFO / UAP phenomena). 

## Hyper Credible Witnesses 

Multiple hyper credible first hand witnesses, deeply inside the programs, begin testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee and providing documented proof, and third party sources and points of triangulation to corroborate their information. 

## Irrefutable Evidence of Alien Hardware and Bodies 

We now have irrefutable evidence that humanity is in possession of multiple alien craft, bodies, and hundreds of thousands of cases. 

Alien hardware and bodies in our hands changes everything. 

## 2024 - Ongoing Reverse Engineering 

To this day, reverse engineering projects continue. 

For example, Radiant Technologies, whose offices are in the districts of the only congress-people blocking disclosure, has the Prompt Global Strike Program, seeking to reverse engineer alien technologies to create the capability to hit the center of Russia or China in 2 minutes from nuclear missiles fired from the United States. 

This would likely entirely upend the balance of power, which is the stated goal of the [[Fascist Security State]], but not We The People.  

## Overwhelming Congressional Support For - UFO Controlled Disclosure Campaign Plan  

After receiving the irrefutable evidence, which Senate Intelligence Committee believes and cannot refute...

...a bill is formulated and passed through US Congress requiring full disclosure to the American people. 

...Senate armed services committee staff, under Jack Reed, Senate intelligence committee under Mark Warner, Marco Rubio, etc. craft 64 page comprehensive bill on how to undertake a responsible and controlled disclosure. 

This bill requires disclosing everything that is more than 25 years old, per standard intelligence requirements, disclosing everything going back to at least January 1945 and revealing that to the public. 

[[Daniel Sheehan]] worked on the bill, including a time schedule of 300 days to gather everything and convert to computer retrievable form. 

And the everything disclosed within a 7 year period. 

The bill required the information would be turned over to National Archives, who was then directed by congress to release all the information to the public within 180 days unless the President personally intervened to stop the disclosure of certain pieces of information. 

A 9 person board with staff and a $20 million budget was established to manage the process, with a list of groups that would nominate members to the board. 

17-0 vote in favor the 64 page bill in Senate intelligence committee, 8 republican and 9 democratic Senators. 

Of 435 members in house, ~420 supported. Overwhelming Senate support. 

Enacted December 22, 2023, 300 day timeline falls on October 18, 2024, two weeks before 2024 election. 

## 2024 - Military Continues to Lie 

As of 2024, US Air Force fact sheet on UFOs and Project Bluebook states: 

As a result of these investigations, studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of Project Blue Book were:  
  
- No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security;  
- There was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge; and  
- There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as "unidentified" were extraterrestrial vehicles.  
  -  Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the Air Force. Given the current environment of steadily decreasing defense budgets, it is unlikely the Air Force would become involved in such a costly project in the foreseeable future.

## Search Warrants / Subpoena Power

We are moving rapidly towards Presidential and Congressional demands to *preserve all evidence* to forestall the ongoing coverups and destruction of evidence (such as those of MKUltra et al). 

Power to subpoena to sworn depositions under oath. 

- The Blue Room at Wright Patterson Air Force Base 
- Battelle Memorial Institute 
- Radiant Technologies 
- Area 51
- White Sands 
- Lockheed Martin 
- Douglas Aircraft 
- Northrop Grumman 
- TRW 
- JPL 
- Other significant [[Military Industrial Complex]] players 
- Universities 

## Eminent Domain

The bill gives the US Government the power to take back into US Government possession the alien craft, biologics (bodies), etc. that are being reversed engineered by the private sector, who are desperately trying to stop the bill. 

## Presidents Not Briefed 

A number of Presidents were not briefed into the above-top-secret UFO / extraterrestrial information. 

## 2010s - 30,000 Abductions Per Year in United States

Former Douglas Think Tank member reports that as of 2012 it was estimated that there were approximately 30,000 alien abductions of US Citizens per year. 

## Interbreeding

The focus of the abductions, according to nearly all those involved, appears to be alien control of and interbreeding with human beings without their consent, and likely advanced genetic engineering. 

While this is hard to believe, John Mack's interviews with hundreds of abduction victims,  provide irrefutably consistent evidence of what abductees experience. 

My own first hand conversations with multiple abduction victims and other individuals with direct personal knowledge of alien activities helped me triangulate the credibility of these highly consistent reports. 

## Misc Notes
- Note that apparent limit of radar systems is 80,000 feet. So when government reports say that UFOs dropped from 80,000 feet to sea level, they are descending from higher than that. That is just where radar picks them up. 

## Bottom Line 

Among many, here are four big problems: 

1. A spiritual war is underway  
2. An alien war is underway   
3. A fascist US / NATO / European out-of-control Deep State intent on deceiving, subjugating and dominating it's citizens and the world  
	1. Using reversed engineered alien technology 
	2. Advised by malevolent alien forces  
	3. Puppetted by malevolent spiritual and alien forces  
4. A rightfully concerned and equally morally wrong Chinese / Russian / North Korean / Iranian counter force ready to wage thermonuclear world war if necessary to prevent their subjugation, and if possible establish their dominance.    
5. Nearly everyone is asleep in [[The Caves]], and far less than 1% of the population is awake and aware of what is going on, and what is at stake.
