# 3. Remembering

When consciousness is incarnated, it goes through a process of forgetting and then needing to reassemble the pieces to the Divine Puzzle.

As you read, remember that a spark of the Divine is within you too. Despite Our [[Apparently Individuated Consiousness]], We are actually aspects of [[One Body and Mind]].
