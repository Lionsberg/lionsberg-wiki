# 8. Translation Across Languages and Levels of Abstraction

The information encoded in the [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]] is crucial for the survival of humanity. 

I am writing in English, at a university level of abstraction. 

Around the world, the training and development has been of sufficiently poor Quality, and the intentional [[Endarkenment]] of the human species of sufficiently high Quality, such that even in relatively wealthy countries like the United States, ***over half of adults have a literacy below a 6th grade level, and one out of every five is below a 5th grade level.*** Around the world, it is at least as uneven. 

Additionally, many have not had the training and luxury to develop the advanced [[Abstract Thinking]] capabilities required to seriously grapple with issues [[Beyond The Boundary]] of the [[Known]]. 

[[The Lionsberg Strategy and Plan]] therefore calls for encoding the information, systems, and tools required for humanity to succeed within the [[Lionsberg Narrative Universe]], a world of archetypes, stories, parables, and examples that every individual, from childhood through old age, across every language of the Earth, will be able to access, apprehend, and comprehend.
