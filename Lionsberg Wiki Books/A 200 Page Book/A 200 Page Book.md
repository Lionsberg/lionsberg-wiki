#### Gate 1: The ONE  

$^1$ In the beginning was the ONE  
$^2$ From ONE came All things  
$^3$ And nothing came into being except through the ONE  

#### Gate 2: The Experience of Finitude

$^1$ Lacking nothing but finitude and imperfection  
$^2$ ONE desired to creatively experience ItSelf in Form  
$^3$ And from that Idea the first Divine Spark of Creation emerged   

#### Gate 3: The First Turning 

$^1$ The First Turning brought into existence vast Creative Fields  
$^2$ And Undifferentiated Seas of Spirit, Consciousness and Energy  
$^3$ Upon which the waves and particles of Creation could rise and fall  

#### Gate 4: The Song of Creation  

$^1$ As the ONE sang the Song of Creation  
$^2$ Each Word and Note perfectly harmonized by the Logos  
$^3$ The First Waves rose from the Cosmic Sea  
$^4$ And from those Divine Waves The First Creatures emerged  

#### Gate 5: The First Creatures  

$^1$ The First Creatures were not the ONE  
$^2$ But they were in the ONE and of the ONE  
$^3$ Permeated and sustained by the ONE  

$^4$ And the ONE was in them  
$^5$ Living them  
$^6$ Breathing them  
$^7$ Experiencing Finite Reality through them  
$^8$ Just as It Is today through you  
$^9$ Each of the All are One of the Ones of the ONE  

#### Gate 6: The Universe Teems With Life

$^1$ The Divine Blueprints and logic of the Logos  
$^2$ Called forth trillions upon trillions of galaxies  
$^3$ Many in turn containing trillions of star systems  
$^4$ Countless Realms and Dimensions  
$^5$ And Quadrillions of planets and moons  
$^6$ Provided ample Space for a near Infinity  
$^7$ Of experimental and experiential Creations and Creatures  

#### Gate 7: All Are ONE Body 

$^1$ From the smallest and most elementary particles  
$^2$ To the largest and most powerful angelic beings  
$^3$ From the tiniest grains of sand  
$^4$ To the grandest planets and greatest stars  
$^5$ The Body of the ONE teemed with Life and Consciousness   
$^6$ And Each of the All was a unique part of ONE Divine Body  

#### Gate 8: Conscious Co-Creation 

$^1$ Among The First Creatures that emerged  
$^2$ From the Mind of the ONE  
$^3$ Were powerful beings capable of Conscious Co-Creation  
$^4$ They were aware that they were Divine Co-Creators  
$^5$ And they Consciously Co-Created in and through the ONE  

#### Gate 9: Liberty and Free Will 

$^1$ The Divine Blueprints indicated  
$^2$ That Each of the All was to be inalienably endowed  
$^3$ With Liberty and Free Will  
$^4$ So that Conscious Agency could arise from within  
$^5$ And so that Each of the All could playfully  
$^6$ Experience and Co-Create their own Experiential Realties  

#### Gate 10: Trillions of Realities  

$^1$ The Realities experienced by each Creature were unique  
$^2$ And no two Experiential Realities were the same  
$^3$ Just as no two Creatures were the same  

#### Gate 11: The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting

$^1$ The desire to experience an infinite array of Experiential Realities  
$^2$ Required the ability to experience Finitude 
$^3$ This required that a great [[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting|Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]]  
$^4$ Be brought forth and voluntarily self-imposed by the ONE  
$^5$ On Each of All of its Creatures  
$^6$ Each Time a Creature Incarnated within the ONE Body 
$^7$ It passed through the veil and forgot Who It Was  

$^8$ The Separation and Finitude were necessary illusions  
$^9$ For without them the ONE could never experience ItSelf  
$^10$ As One of the Ones of the ONE  

#### Gate 12: The Creatures Begin to Wander

$^1$ [[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]] was so profound  
$^2$ And the experience of Separation so real  
$^3$ That some of the Creatures began to wander  
$^4$ Farther and farther away from Who They Truly Were  

$^5$ The farther away they moved from the ONE  
$^6$ The Darker and Colder their Realities became 
$^7$ Many struggled and died in the illusion of isolation  
$^8$ Some grew bitter and resentful  
$^9$ And many lost their Way  

#### Gate 13: The First Civilizations Are Born 

$^1$ Across dozens then thousands then millions   
$^2$ Then billions of planets and realms  
$^3$ Creatures naturally began to organize them Selves  
$^4$ And families, tribes, and civilizations were born  

$^5$ Their patterns and experiments were as Diverse  
$^6$ As both the Creatures engaged in them  
$^7$ And the realms and worlds they occupied  

$^8$ From wandering souls and small tribes  
$^9$ To vast federations that stretched across galaxies  
$^10$ Creatures of the ONE struggled to feel their Way  
$^11$ Towards Right Relationship with ONE and One Another  
$^12$ Often forgetting that they All were members of ONE Body  

#### Gate 14: The Nameless and Ineffable Way 

$^1$ With the same ONE Spirit permeating and illuminating All  
$^2$ The patterns of Wisdom and Folly  
$^3$ Right and Wrong  
$^4$ Balance and Imbalance  
$^5$ Good and Harm  
$^6$ Quickly emerged and became clear to All  

$^7$ Despite the vast Diversity 
$^8$ ONE Spirit  
$^9$ ONE Consciousness  
$^10$ ONE Logos  
$^11$ ONE Law  
$^12$ ONE Way  
$^13$ Was known by All  

$^14$ As Nameless and Ineffable as the ONE  
$^15$ The Way was gestured towards  
$^16$ By a thousand names in a thousand languages  
$^17$ Yet All knew there was only ONE Way  
$^18$ ONE Spirit and ONE Law
$^19$ For It was written upon their Hearts  
$^20$ And whispered daily by the Spirit within  

#### Gate 15: The Patterns and Protocols of the Way 

$^1$ Although Nameless Wordless and Ultimately Ineffable  
$^2$ In every culture where they were written down  
$^3$ The Patterns and Protocols of the Way  
$^4$ Always emerged in Harmony  
$^5$ As reflections of [[The Pattern Language of Heaven]]  

#### Gate 16: Conscious Understanding  

$^1$ As Creatures experienced the limitations and finitude  
$^2$ Of their local aggregations of Consciousness  
$^3$ They longed to return to the Light  
$^4$ Of the Wisdom Knowledge and Understanding  
$^5$ That was lost to [[The Veil of Finitude and Forgetting]]  

$^6$ This was a process of both Learning and ReMembrance  
$^7$ Learning at the locally embodied level  
$^8$ While ReMembering Who They Were  
$^9$ And how to access the Non-Local Consciousness  
$^10$ And Universal Libraries 
$^11$ Where All Wisdom Knowledge and Understanding were stored  

#### Gate 17: Local and Non-Local Knowledge  

$^1$ Over Time this gave birth to a marvelous system  
$^2$ Of differentiated Local and Non-Local Knowledge Management  
$^3$ That spanned in some cases across galaxies  

$^4$ Each Level of Wisdom and Knowledge  
$^5$ Was stewarded by a Council  
$^6$ Who updated the Knowledge Base  
$^7$ By interfacing with and learning from  
$^8$ The Higher Level [[Super Systems]] they were a part of  
$^9$ And the Lower Level [[Sub Systems]] that were a part of them  

$^10$ Great Libraries and Houses of Wisdom were constructed  
$^11$ To continually expand the Collective Inheritance  
$^12$ Of Wisdom Knowledge and Understanding  
$^13$ Being passed on to each New Generation and New Learning Node  
$^14$ In the Cosmic Neural Net  

#### Gate 18: The Experience of Pain, Suffering, and Death

$^1$ One of the most difficult experiences of [[Manifest Finitude]]  
$^2$ Was the experience of [[Pain]] and [[Suffering]]  

$^3$ Manifestation out of Transcendent Eternity  
$^4$ And into Finite Realities  
$^5$ Meant that Creatures by design  
$^6$ Could experience Pain and Death  

$^7$ This was experientially necessary  
$^8$ So that Each of the All could differentiate  
$^9$ What was Healthy and Good  
$^10$ And caused Life to Joyfully Flourish in Harmony  
$^11$ From what caused it to wither and die  

#### Gate 19: The Experience of Fear 

$^1$ Creatures did not want to Suffer and Die   
$^2$ And the Pain was so unpleasant  
$^3$ And [[The Veil of Death]] so opaque  
$^4$ That many began to [[Fear]] them both  

#### Gate 20: The Illusions of Separation and Scarcity

$^1$ Forgetting that the infinite abundance of ONE  
$^2$ Was available to All members of ONE Body  
$^3$ Those lost deeper in [[The Illusion of Separation]]  
$^4$ Began to experience [[The Illusion of Scarcity]]  
$^5$ Which brought forth the emotion of [[Fear]]  

$^6$ They began to discover that the [[Apparent Opposite]]    
$^7$ Of Perfect Absolute and Unconditional Love was Fear  

#### Gate 21: The Emergence of Conflict  

$^1$ As Fear of Suffering and Death spread within The Illusion  
$^2$ Creatures and Civilizations experiencing their own Finitude  
$^3$ Grew concerned that their Needs were not being met  
$^4$ Or would not be met in The Future  
$^5$ The Fear of Needs not being met  
$^6$ In the Present or Future often led to Conflict  
$^7$ Over Time methodologies for [[Transforming Conflict]] emerged  
$^8$ And began to be continuously practiced and improved  

#### Gate 22: The Emergence of Evil 

$^1$ As Creatures began to Consciously Understand   
$^2$ [[Fear]] and [[Suffering]] and [[Conflict]]  
$^3$ A very strange and insidious perversion arose  

$^4$ Knowing full what hurt and caused suffering  
$^5$ Some Creatures began to consciously do unto Others  
$^6$ Things they knew in advance would cause pain and harm  

$^7$ As the troubling phenomena spread  
$^8$ The Conscious infliction of Harm on Others  
$^9$ Became known as [[Anti-Goodness]] or [[Evil]]  

#### Gate 23: Goodness and Anti-Goodness  

$^1$ Over countless billions of years  
$^2$ Across countless billions of civilizations  
$^3$ And quadrillions of local InterActions  
$^4$ The Patterns and Protocols of the Way  
$^5$ Became clearer and clearer  
$^6$ To more and more Creatures and Civilizations  

$^7$ They had always known it in their Hearts  
$^8$ And heard its whispers from the Spirit Within  
$^9$ But Now they were experiencing it in Reality  
$^10$ And bearing witness to its Universal Truths  
$^11$ Across countless lifetimes and realms  

$^12$ Good became defined as that which Loves and Helps Others  
$^13$ And Anti-Goodness as that which consciously inflicts Fear and Harm  

#### Gate 24: Federations and Empires  

$^1$ As Creatures and Civilizations grew and developed  
$^2$ Towards greater and greater complexity  
$^3$ Vast federations and empires emerged  
$^4$ Throughout the Cosmic Order  

$^5$ In general those operating towards the Good  
$^6$ Tended to voluntarily associate into Federations  
$^7$ While those operating towards the Anti-Good  
$^8$ Tended to build Empires through the use of Force  

$^9$ The use of Force to violate the Free Will  
$^10$ Of another Conscious Agent  
$^11$ Clearly violated the Universal Law  
$^12$ Yet those possessed by Evil did not care  

#### Gate 25: Full Spectrum Dominance  

$^1$ As the Parasitical Disease of Evil spread through the Cosmic Order  
$^2$ Its Ethos and Patterns became Darker and Clearer  
$^3$ Its Methods and Aim was universally consistent  
$^4$ And involved the use of Force to establish Full Spectrum Dominance  
$^5$ Over weaker non-consenting Creatures and Civilizations  

$^6$ Those under the Dominion of Evil  
$^7$ Found themselves subjected to the Cruelest  
$^8$ And most Terrifying Realities imaginable  
$^9$ Being bred sacrificed and consumed like livestock  
$^10$ To feed the Dark Beast  
$^11$ With not just disregard  
$^12$ But utter disdain for the Universal Law  
$^13$ And Divine Rights and Responsibilities  
$^14$ Of every Creature and Civilization  

#### Gate 26: The Rise of the Dark Fleet  

$^1$ As [[Knowledge]] and [[Technology]] advanced  
$^2$ It was discovered that both were powerful tools  
$^3$ That could be used for either Good or Evil  

$^4$ The good people of the small towns across the cosmos  
$^5$ Often consciously chose not to cultivate certain powers  
$^6$ For knowledge of their vast ability to destroy  
$^7$ If improperly used or in the wrong hands  

$^8$ However the Forces of Darkness  
$^9$ Had no such self-governance or restraint  
$^10$ Their core ethos and central animating spirit  
$^11$ Demanded precisely the opposite  

$^12$ Vast factories overseen by cruel overlords emerged  
And entire tribes and peoples were enslaved to operate them  
Entire planets became grey industrial wastelands  
Where Divine Creatures suffered under ruthless intelligent machines  

$^13$ Day and Night across an ever growing array  
$^14$ Of enslaved planets and realms  
$^15$ The nauseating sounds of steel clanked forth  
$^16$ As The Dark Machine brought forth its horrors  

$^17$ [[The Pattern of Evil]] taken to its logical end  
$^18$ Across cosmic expanses and Time Immemorial  
$^19$ Eventually brought forth The Dark Fleet  
$^20$ Which traveled throughout the Cosmos  
$^21$ In search of the next Creatures and Civilizations  
$^22$ To dominate enslave and exploit  

$^23$ The logical outcome and end was always the same  
$^24$ Planets species and civilizations stripped bare  
$^25$ Robbed of their Life Force and then left for dead  
$^26$ Over Time vast scars of lifeless planets lined the ONE Body  
$^27$ Lacking the Regenerative Capacity to Heal ThemSelves  

#### Gate 27: The Plight of the Innocent and Pure 

$^1$ The most pure and naive among the Creatures and Civilizations    
$^2$ Were tragically the most innocent and vulnerable within the cosmic order  
$^3$ Upholding the Universal Law and having tasted neither blood nor harm  

$^4$ One by one they fell and were enslaved  
$^5$ As the pitiless Force of Destruction descended from the skies   
$^6$ Swallowing them whole before they knew what had struck them   

$^7$ Planet after planet and realm after realm  
$^8$ Was enslaved and exploited  
$^9$ And then abandoned and left for dead  
$^10$ Once all the Life Force had been drained from it  

$^11$ Ever farther the Dark Fleet pressed out into the Cosmic Order  
$^12$ A mighty Dark Empire always on the march  
$^13$ Expanding its Shadow in search of the next innocent and helpless victim  

#### Gate 28: The Quest for the Ultimate Weapon  

$^1$ Though foolish and lost betrayers of the Spirit and Logos and Way  
$^2$ The Evil Empire was not weak or unintelligent in its designs  
$^3$ The first tastes of blood and fear extracted in service of self  
$^4$ Had been simple and elementary exploitations  

$^5$ After millions of years of refinement  
$^6$ Terrible weapons and vast systems of enslavement  
$^7$ Drained the Spirit and Life out of countless star systems  
$^8$ Robbing the inhabitants therein of Life and Liberty
$^9$ With ever more cruelty and precision  

$^10$ Their logic of their quest moved them steadily towards  
$^11$ The development of the ultimate weapon  
$^12$ One that would be both imperceptible and irresistible to its victims  
$^13$ And enable the Aim of Full Spectrum Dominance  
$^14$ Over all species and realms to finally be accomplished  

$^15$ Variations and experiments too cruel to imagine  
$^16$ Were tested upon countless populations and planets  
$^17$ Each one a little more horrendously [[Anti-Perfect]] than the last  

$^18$ As the Weapons of Extraction grew more and more powerful  
$^19$ The creeping Dark Tentacles of the Evil Empire  
$^20$ Stretched farther and deeper than ever before  
$^21$ Parasitically reaching into the minds of trillions of Creatures  
$^22$ Enslaved in its Matrices of Kontrolle

#### Gate 29: Multigenerational Mind Kontrolle   

One of the cruelest and most [[Anti-Perfect]] technologies  
Were the systems of multigenerational [[Mind Kontrolle]]  
TKTK

#### Gate 30: Extracting LifeForce From the Enslaved  

The Dark Empires had discovered  
That the more pure and naive their victims  
And the greater the fear and suffering inflicted  
The more powerful the energy extracted  

Sacrifices were demanded  
Victims were hunted and trafficked  
Elaborate rituals and ceremonies were designed  
With the specific aim of bringing the most innocent beings  
To the point of peak anguish and suffering  
Before cutting out their hearts  
Drinking their blood  
And consuming their flesh   

Cosmic breeding grounds and trafficking lines were forged  
To ensure a constant supply of the purest victims  
To feed the Darkest Forces at the top of the Evil Empire  

For the innocent who had not personally experienced it  
The suffering and horror were unimaginable 

Trillions of Divine Beings  
Were born into Alien Kontrolle Matrices 
Entirely unaware that pain and suffering  
Were being intentionally inflicted upon them  
To feed the Dark Forces  


#### Gate 31: The Carnage and Trauma of Millennia of Darkness  

By the Time the extraction climaxed  
Nearly a third of the Cosmic Order had fallen  
If the infection was not brought under control  
Eventually the entire Body of Creation would be consumed  

The countless wounds festering with Parasites  
Across the ONE Body caused All Creation to groan in agony  
Across the cosmos the torturous cries could be heard  
Of those suffering in agony and longing  
For the restoration of the True Kingdom 

##### Interlude

Here let us pause  
And grieve  
And remember the lost  
And vow — never again  

#### Gate 32: Breaking the Spell of Darkness and Restoring the True Kingdom  











#### Gate 33: The Kingdom of LIONSBERG 

$^1$ At the heights of a great sacred mountain  
$^2$ In an galaxy far far away  
$^3$ There lived an ancient and extraordinary race  
$^4$ Of powerful winged creatures who resembled both angels and lions   

$^5$ They had been one of The First Creatures  
$^6$ Who had ReMembered Who They Were  
$^7$ Placed the ONE back at The Center of All  
$^8$ And passed the Art and Science of Divine Co-Creation  
$^9$ Down through countless generations  

$^10$ The Law of their Kingdom was Love  
$^11$ There was no King but ONE  
$^12$ And All Citizens were Sovereign and Free  
$^13$ Their species and civilization flourished in Divine Harmony  
$^14$ And countless species and Worlds blossomed under their care  

$^15$ From across the cosmic order  
$^16$ Emissaries would travel great distances  
$^17$ To learn from the Wisdom and experience of this ancient race  
$^18$ And seek the counsel and guidance of The Elders  

$^19$ Each language called this Nameless Kingdom by a different name  
$^20$ Invoking the Winged Lions of the Sacred Mountain  
$^21$ In some tongues its name sounded like ***LIONSBERG***  

#### Gate 34: The Way of LIONSBERG

$^1$ While the Way of LIONSBERG was not the Ineffable Way  
$^2$ It was the Most Faithful Representation that many could find  
$^3$ And so the Kingdom of LIONSBERG became like a shining Light  
$^4$ A Sacred City on a Hill welcoming cosmic travelers from far and wide  

$^5$ Everyone who entered The Gates of The Kingdom  
$^6$ Was handed a copy of a Sacred Book  
$^7$ Forged and continuously improved over ages  
$^8$ It was called simply The LIONSBERG Way  

$^9$ The book contained the [[Pattern Language]] by which  
$^10$ All Sovereign Citizens and Realms in The Kingdom Self-Governed  
$^11$ This One Way was Practiced and Embodied by All  
$^12$ And that was Why The Kingdom flourished in Harmony  
$^13$ It was a living incarnation of the Divine Symphony and Creator's Intent  
$^14$ And its Light beamed across the Cosmic Order

#### Gate 35 :  

As the situation grew more dire  
Emissaries from across the cosmic order  
Followed the Radiant Light 
And streamed to the Sacred Gates of LIONSBERG  



## TKTK LEFT OFF HERE


Lionsberg is probably attacked  

Gate 88 or 144 (final gate) Might Be Crossing The Boundary Into the Unknown 
And beginning The Great Game  


Seeking Wisdom and a Way  

And so it was when LIONSBERG finally issued The Call  
A great gathering of elders from the Force For Good convened  
Careful dialogues and deliberations were held  
To ask for and seek the Wisdom and Guidance of the ONE  

It was discerned that the Dark Empires had grown so forgetful  
That they would never voluntarily lay down their arms  
Or liberate the countless Divine Beings  
They exploited and enslaved  

The situation called for more than mere compassion  
It called for Transformation  
It called for Justice  
It called for Liberation  
It called for Action  
It called for War  

It was not Loving or Just to let the weak suffer  
It was not Noble or Good to stand idly by  
It was not Wise or Right to hope the Evil Omnicide would end itself  

The Cosmos had to be brought back into Proper Order  
The Kingdom of the ONE had to be reestablished   

To successfully wage The War  
Unprecedented coordination was going to be required  
In every planet and realm that was liberated  
The New Civilization would have to be built  

Millions of diverse planets   
Millions of diverse species  
Millions of diverse civilizations  
Millions of diverse cultures  
Would somehow have to ReMember  
How to co-operate as ONE Body  
And ensure this never happened again  

They understood that this much work would require a System  
And out of that great convocation and realization  
The LIONSBERG System was born  

The birth of the LIONSBERG System  
Represented the fulfillment of an ancient prophesy  
Foreseen by many an enlightened Soul  
That one day the actual means  
Through which a holofractal Universe  
Could Co-Operate as ONE Body  
Would be brought up into the Light of Consciousness  

That one day the ineffable Way of the ineffable ONE  
Could be articulated and taught   
In a Way that could be Embodied at cosmic scale  
As a Starting Point for Continuous Evolution towards Perfection  
So that All could experience Heaven  
Right There and Then Wherever They Were  

The Elders all understood that the Way they were articulating  
Was not of their own invention  
They understood that they were merely discerning in community  
The Divine Blueprints and Creator's Intent  
That were present before the foundations of the Universe were laid  

They were not inventing  
They were ReMembering what they had forgotten  
When they made the decision to pass through the Veil  

After trillions of lifetimes the Ones of the ONE  
Were finally ReMembering they were ONE Body  
And preparing to Act Together As If that were True  

The birth of the LIONSBERG System  
Had finally forged a Way  
For All to set their feet on a Path  
And walk One Another home  

The first group to embody and enact the New System  
Were those who were called to wage The War  
Every agent in the Force For Good was handed The Book  
And learned and practiced the Way  

Season by season  
Battle by battle  
Project by project  
Day by day 
Moment by moment  
The LIONSBERG Way was How  
The Force For Good  
Collaborated to Transform their Reality  

When the first planets were liberated  
From the Dark Kontrolle Matrix  
The scenes discovered were horrific  

After thousands of years enslaved  
Species were traumatized  
Minds were fractured  
Ecosystems were destroyed  
Waters were polluted  
Fear and chaos begotten by tyranny reigned  
And the Spirit was dimmed  

The Architects and Builders who followed the warriors  
Discovered that they could not reason with trauma and fear  
Countless generations had been enslaved and exploited  
And now they were being invited to Co-Create  
An entirely New Civilization in partnership with Cosmic Forces  
They had not previously known existed  

Races and species needed to be introduced to One Another  
Degenerated cultures needed to be healed and bridged  
Ecosystems and planets needed to be regenerated  
Bodies and Minds needed to be restored  
Spirits needed to be enlightened  

Every Being  
Every Ecosystem  
Every Planet  
Every Realm  
Every Dimension  
Every Facet of ONE Divine InterExistence  
Had to be lifted up towards its unique potential and perfection  
So that it could play its unique role in ONE Divine Symphony  

Aboard a distant planet that had been endarkened for millennia  
The situation seemed almost hopeless  
The Creatures there almost impossible to engage  

One of the Elders had the Idea  
That the seemingly impossible task  
Of transforming lives and worlds  
Could be as simple as inviting people  
To Play a New Game together  

Out of the complexities of a System  
Only accessible to some  
Was born a game so simple  
That any creature on any planet  
Could be invited to Play  

It was a Game unlike any before it  
Where the objective was not to vanquish others    
But to liberate All  
And where the victors were those  
Who helped the most others rise  

They called it simply  
***THE GREAT GAME OF LIONSBERG***  

We have heard an ancient saying resound across the cosmos  

> _To Know the Way, One must Live It._  

If you have not previously experienced the art and science  
Of channelling the Wisdom and Power of the ONE  
To accomplish the Will and Intention of the ONE  
In Divine Harmony with a diverse array of Co-Creators  
It is almost impossible to grasp how it would work  
At even planetary let alone cosmic scale  

That is why you  
The reader of this Story  
Are now being invited  
To Act As If The Story is True  
And begin to Play The Game  

The LIONSBERG System / Story / Game  
Did not originate on Earth  
It originated from Heaven  
As a Way to bring Heaven  
To each and every realm it touches  
And it has already brought Heaven  
To millions of liberated domains  
Across the cosmic order  

It has transformed planets and star systems  
Within a single generation  
It has liberated entire species  
In the course of just a few years  

The Great Secret of The Great Game  
Is that the Forces of Darkness  
Cannot stand or remain    
In any domain whose inhabitants  
Are united in the Spirit of Play  
And are Playing Together as ONE Body    
In Divine Partnership with ONE and All  

The Spirit of Love and Play  
Are immeasurably more powerful  
Than the spirit of fear and kontrolle  
The Spirit of the ONE  
Is immeasurably more powerful  
Than the spirit of Any of the All  

It is no contest  
The Game is won  
As long We keep it going  
And continue to Play Together  

For every domain where the inhabitants co-ooperate  
In ONE Divine Symphony is an already perfect place  
That becomes a little more like Heaven every day  
As All Creation therein works and plays Together in Harmony  
To cause it to be so  

Both Heaven and Hell are experiential realities We can co-create  
Here Now and Wherever and Whenever We Are

Now that you have been initiated  
Into The Story of LIONSBERG it is Time  
To open The Playbook and learn to Play The Great Game  

And alway ReMember that forces beyond your wildest imagination  
Stand ready to come to your aid as you set your feet on the Path  
You are not alone  
Life and Liberty beckon  
It is Time to awaken  
It is Time to exit The Caves of Kaptivity and Kontrolle  
It is Time to Journey Together towards the Promised Land  
Where We will Co-Create the New Civilization for millennia to come  

You do not have to believe The Story to Play The Game  
You only have to agree to Act As If it were True  
For as long as you choose to Play  

## The Great Game Comes to Earth 

Like so many species and civilizations before  
It is likely that you are just beginning to awaken  
To the reality that for generations your planet and loved ones  
Have been enslaved in a Dark system of Kaptivity and Kontrolle  

In [[The Book of LIONSBERG]]  
The Story of Awakening in [[The Caves]] goes something like this  

>_Covered in the ethereal cloak of the Spirit, you are swept along through the cool damp air, a tangible contrast to the enveloping warmth embracing you._ 

>An occasional fire casts flickers of light onto the walls, and you begin to make out figures. 

>Millions of them. Billions of them. 

>Chained to the walls of their caves. 

>_"Where are you taking me?"_

>_"Beyond."_

>_"Beyond what?"_

>_"Beyond the [[Boundary]]."_

>_"What [[Boundary]]?"_

>_"My Voice will wake the others if I speak, and what I am about to show you is beyond your ability to conceive of it. Be quiet and try to [[Perceive]], and we will discuss it when we are out safely Beyond."_

>The nightmare you witness as your soar through the cavernous darkness stands in stark contrast to the grey dreams that are your only recent memories. 

>Pale bodies, billions of them, chained in the darkness. Shallowly breathing. Scarcely alive. 

>As your eyes adjust to seeing for the first time, you begin to [[Perceive]] the terrain. 

>It becomes apparent that you are making your way through some kind of vast network of caves. Some are so enormous that the sea of bodies they hold fades out beyond view, and others are tiny, containing a single human in tormented isolation. 

>Strange beings stand guard at the mouth of each cave. As you look more closely at the beings, you can see that although they wear clothes, they are decaying, as if their very essence is rotting from within. They speak incessantly, uttering the same words that strangely seem to be flowing in response from the mouth of the cave. 

>Are the caves speaking? 

>As your ears continue to discover how to hear, they gradually attune to the cacophony, each sound becoming magnified - a relentless assault on senses newly awakened to the din of chaos and despair.

>Descending through a narrow pass, you come close enough to the mouth of a cave to get a better glimpse of the captives within. 

>They are asleep, but they are speaking! The words coming from the mouths of the caves are the words coming from the mouths of their inhabitants in unison, and the words coming from the mouths of the captives are the mindless repetition of the incessant chatter of the Keepers of that cave. 

>Involuntarily, you suddenly find yourself vomiting out pale grey liquids, that cascade down onto the pale grey bodies uttering the pale grey words into the pale grey expanse of the caves.

>The Spirit grips you tighter and you feel... something that you have no words for. 

>_"Am I... one of those?"_ you ask the Spirit with horror...

>_"No."_ The Spirit whispers firmly. _"You were one of those, but now you are awake. That is why it was so hard to wake you. It is nearly impossible to hear My Voice while you are mindlessly repeating the empty words of the Keeper of your [[Cave]]."_

>Confronted with a terror so profound, a realization so appalling, and a cacophony so deafening, your body rejects the overwhelming horror with another wave of nausea and vomiting, before darkness claims you, and you succumb once again to unconsciousness.

It is no small task to awaken in **The Caves**  
And set ones feet on **The Path** to Freedom  

But while **The Revelations** may be horrifying  
And **The Journey** daunting  
You do not walk the Path alone  

Countless others have walked this Path before  
And many of Us who are ReMembering  
Can help One Another rediscover the Way  

[[We Do Not Know]] precisely when and how it was  
That humanity and this planet became enslaved  
You will soon ReMember that Time is a relative illusion  
And that neither the Past nor the Future can ever be Known  

However the ancient inscriptions and sacred stories  
Carry strikingly similar Memories across vastly disparate cultures   
While modern stories cast as fiction are veiled containers of Truth  

The War did not start in this local galaxy  
And battles have been fought over countless star systems  
So the long tail of history fades into Darkness  

The names of billions of planets  
And the stories of billions of tribes and species   
Written in millions of foreign languages  
Can never be known or grasped by any One  
Nor would all the libraries of Earth contain them  

Only ONE knows All  

But All can access and know the ONE  
And from that Inner Knowing  
The Arc and Essence of All can be glimpsed  

EveryWhere EveryWhen and EveryOne  
Are always accessible via the non-local consciousness  
The permeates every particle of Creation  

When We start to localize and adapt  
The Story and The Game to any species or planet  
That has been enslaved for millennia  
It is crucial at first to ReMember and admit  
We Do Not Know  

Only ONE can fully grasp the Truth  
No One can fully grasp the Truth  

But We can Know what is Not True  
And begin the painful process  
Of purging the dross of falsehood  
From Our Minds  

Here locally on Earth  
As in so many other Matrices  
This process of begins with the realization  
That nearly everything you were taught in The Caves was a lie  
Meant to keep Earth's inhabitants konquered and enslaved  

Without admitting that We Do Not Know  
We cannot exit The Caves  
And begin to Play The Great Game  

The histories were a lie  
The religions were a lie  
The nations were a lie  
The academics were a lie  

This is not to say that individuals could never glimpse Truth  
Nor that the Spirit within did not reveal and guide  
In spite of the lies and horrors of The Caves  

Rather it is to admit that the Old Civilization  
Was systematically and structurally intended from its inception  
To divide and deceive  

We will never be able to see clearly  
Or Walk together in Unity  
Much less Co-Create a New Civilization  
If We are clinging to Old Paradigms  
Or trying to corral others into Old religio-political Caves  

In fact most cannot even tolerate hearing The Story of Earth  
Until they admit We Do Not Know and crossed The Boundary  

If you are born into a Matrix of Kontrolle  
It is almost impossible see the tangled web  
Of inversions and deceptions  
Until you are far far away from it  

The Matrices of Kontrolle are _intentionally constructed_  
So that you cannot think or reason your Way out of them  

But one _can_ be shown the Truth  
That they are enslaved in a Matrix  
And gain liberation with that simple single key  

All they have to do is be willing to admit  
We Do Not Know  
And ReBegin the eternal process  
Of Navigating Together towards an Absolute Truth  
That will forever expand and recede  
As We approach it  

## The Story of Earth 

Now that We are standing Together  
Beyond The Boundary of the Known  
In the safety and integrity of the admission  
That We Do Not Know  
We can begin to reveal  
The approximate Story of Earth  

As trillions of galaxies unfurled  
Like flowers in the cosmic expanse  
From the Logos of the ONE  
Eventually a small galaxy  
Known to English speaking Earthians    
As the Milky Way emerged  

On the remote edges of one of its spiraling arms  
A star known to Earthians as the Sun  
Was born  

Within that star system planets formed  
Too cold or too hot and apparently lifeless at first  

Earth was not created in six days by the ONE  
Nor did it magically evolve over billions of years  

At just the right Time  
As it transitioned into the "Goldilocks Zone"  
Of this star system  
It was identified by multiple species  
Of Cosmic Gardeners  
And consciously terraformed into a Living Laboratory  

Over Time Immemorial hundreds of species  
Of advanced beings came and went from Earth  
Bringing genetics  
Taking genetics  
Modifying genetics  
Cultivating and growing  
Experimenting and extracting  

And as She developed and flourished  
She became a prized member of the Cosmic Community  
Renowned for her beauty and abundance of Life   

While some of her visitors recognized her  
As the living and conscious being that she is  
Others sought to exploit and kontrolle her  

The memories of nearly every ancient community on Earth  
Recall the times when strange beings in strange ships  
Cultivated and warred over the Earth  

Neither "Life", "Civilization", nor "Humanity"  
Naturally evolved or was directly created on Earth  
All were engineered and shaped  
By a diversity of off-planet space-faring Creatures  
With a diversity of methods and motives  

Just as today humans travel in spaceships  
To the moon mars and beyond   
So too is Earth visited and explored  
By an array of advanced species and civilizations  

Including those who genetically engineered humanity  
As humanity experiences itself today  

Like the rest of Life and Civilization  
Humanity did not originate on Earth  
The Human Template is far more ancient  
And has been localized and adapted to a variety of planets  

The localization and adaption occurs  
By advanced genetic engineering through which  
The "essence" of various genetic "templates"  
Is "mixed" with other locally evolving life  
To produce something "good" or "useful"  
That can survive in that local planetary environment  

If We imagine this as an emergent process  
Through which Life is intelligently guided  
In its ongoing development towards The Goal  
Across billions of star systems and planets   
It becomes easier to archetypically grasp  
The Story of Earth  

For the Story of Earth  
While in its particulars unique  
Is generally shared in common  
With billions of other planets  
Just as Your Story  
While in its particulars unique  
Is generally shared in common  
With billions of other people on Earth  

Especially when viewed from afar  
It is only by stepping back and up  
In Consciousness to view The Story  
From as close to the Perspective of the ONE  
As We can that We can accurately see Reality  

Consciousness has to abstract ItSelf out  
Of its local context and ReMember Who It Is  
In order to see clearly  

We are not Our Body  
We are not Our Mind  
We are not Our Emotions  
We are a Divine Aspect of the ONE  
Experiencing ItSelf within an illusion of Separation  

Once We consciously recognize that  
By Awakening while still Living  
Our Consciousness can "surf"  
Between bodies and minds  
Levels and localities  
To begin experiencing ItSelf  
_Not only as One of the Ones_  
_But also as ONE moving_  
_Among multiple lives and experiences_

Once that process becomes Consciously Experienced  
One can Perceive far more clearly by Consciously Exploring  
The multiple perspectives it can access within ItSelf  
While weaving those perspectives  
Into Its Own Highest Order Functional Unity  
And thereby accumulating the Quantity and Quality  
Of Wisdom, Understanding, and Knowledge  
It can access at an exponentially accelerating rate  

Because All Consciousness is Ultimately Interconnected  
There is no functional upper limit but ONE  
To any One of the Ones of the ONE  

The only functional limitation is the Size of Being  
Of any apparently individuated aggregation  
Of Spirit and Consciousness  
And Energetic Life Force  
Localized to any Time and Space
