# Meditation 47

The defects and misses are precisely what reveal to us the Way. Every time we disprove a hypothesis, we get closer to the Truth. If we are searching for a treasure hidden in a field, every piece of ground that we discover does not contain the treasure leads us closer to the One place that does. Every time we reveal what is not, we progress towards what is. Every time we reveal what does not work, we get closer to the Way. The Way is to constantly disprove, constantly 'fail', constantly miss the mark, and to learn and improve from each and every attempt. No one laughs at a child when their arrow misses their Aim. The Way is Practice.
