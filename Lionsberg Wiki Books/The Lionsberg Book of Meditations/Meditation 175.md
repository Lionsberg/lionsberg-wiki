# Meditation 175

What is in control of your embodiment? Do not let the fears and desires of shallow, temporal flesh drive you towards and away from threats and opportunities like an animal. Discover deep within your Self the Spirit, and discover what it is like to deftly pilot your body from above towards its Destiny. This is the victory of Spirit over flesh, metaphysical over physical, that must be won in every soul.
