You, each of you, every person, tribe, and nation on earth, you are my brother and my sister. I [[Love]] you. You, each of you, every [[Creature]] of [[Earth]], you are my relative. I Love you. 

You might choose to torture, imprison, or destroy my body, but my Spirit cannot be harmed and I will always Love you. You are my family, and if you kill me, it is only because you know not what you do. Someday you will see and weep, and we will embrace. I pray that will occur [[Here]] and [[Now]], while we still have the chance to save one another the suffering that otherwise lies ahead.
