Spiritual life must be first be rooted in pure transcendent stillness, being, and becoming. 

It is only a transforming [[Spirit]] that is being progressively liberated from self united to [[God]] that can *impel* us towards proper external action and manifestation. 

Following the laws and rules of religion is the most elementary form of imitation. They *compel* and *discipline* us into reasonably acceptable forms of manifestation, yet they are entirely devoid of the Spirit that *impels* us towards exceedingly, abundantly, and far greater heights of service, ecstasy, and unity.
