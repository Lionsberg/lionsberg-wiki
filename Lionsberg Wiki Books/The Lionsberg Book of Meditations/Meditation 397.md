The [[Spirit]] and [[Logos]] of [[Christ]] belongs to [[All]] beings and All creation, equally and without exception. The [[Love]] of [[God]] can never be boxed in by tribe, nation, or religion. The Love of God, like the rain, falls on All equally and without exception. It is offered freely from [[ONE]] to [[All]], without mediation or precondition. Though we reject it a thousand times, the eternal invitation into Loving [[Covenant Relationship]] between [[ONE]] and [[All]] remains. Though we fail it a thousand times, Love never fails.
