The general pattern is the radiant descent, incarnation, and dissolution of the Spiritual Life Force through its creation. Nearly all creatures remain unconscious and unaware of the Divine beginning that is actively creating, sustaining, living, and breathing them. As it has been said for millennia, "([[God]]), in Whom we live and move and have our being," and "([[God]]), Who gives life and breath and everything else" to [[All]]. Those few who come into conscious awareness of their Divine beginning while still in embodied form and can divide the [[Spiritual]] and the [[Material]] through the Word of Truth have the opportunity, the invitation, and indeed the Divine mandate to consciously reascend and reunite with the [[One]] radiating them. This is the beginning of the [[Divine Reunion]].
