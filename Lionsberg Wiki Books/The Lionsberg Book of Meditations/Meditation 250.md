In the times at hand and ahead, corrupt leaders and power structures will order you or your children to war against the "[[Others]]" you have been conditioned to [[Fear]]. Remember that if your children met their children on a playground, they would laugh and play together, and run back to their parents to cry and be embraced when they were hurt. We are all children of [[ONE]] God, and we [[All]] laugh, play, and suffer. If we follow the corrupt [[Power Structures]] of the [[Old World]] to [[War]] along the [[Old]] Dividing Lines, we will heap endless [[Suffering]] upon our own heads, and upon the heads of [[Future Generations]]. The [[Good]] people of the small towns of North America, Asia, South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, the island nations and all other places must stand and fight together against [[Corruption]], [[Tyranny]], [[Evil]], [[Oppression]] and [[Injustice]], and not against [[One Another]].
