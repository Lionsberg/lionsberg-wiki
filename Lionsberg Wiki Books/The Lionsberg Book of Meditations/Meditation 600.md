The path of a [[Creature]] back towards its [[Creator]] was made manifest to us through the Ideal of the [[Christ]], first archetypically, prophetically, and poetically, second through the life and words of [[Jesus]], and ultimately through the full manifestation and fulfillment of the [[Ideal]] in the future when the Spirit of Christ, which is the Spirit of God fully manifest in Self-Conscious and God-Conscious embodied form, reincarnates Itself to vanquish corruption and injustice and establish the [[Kingdom of God]]. The [[Way]] is through the conscious reascension of the individuated human spirit back towards union and [[Right Relationship]] with the manifest Spirit of God within, and of the reunited manifest Spirit back towards reunion with Its Transcendent Source, with Whom it is One.
