All [[Matter]] is composed of [[Energy]]. 

All [[Energy]] associates and dissociates according to the Divine Logic. 

The Divine Logic, or [[Logos]], is what [[God]] has in [[Mind]]. 

The Logos, or Word of God, progressively expresses and articulates the Wisdom of God. 

As God thinks and speaks the Word of God, the Spirit of God carries it forth throughout the universe, creating and sustaining All things according to the Divinely Spoken Wisdom, Logic, Purpose, and Plan.
