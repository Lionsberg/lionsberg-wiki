[[Work]] is what we do to co-create [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

[[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] is its own Value and Reward. 

If we Work for the praise or rewards of humanity, we will do the wrong thing, and enslave our selves to the creators of the temporal rewards. 

If we Work in service of God, striving to do the [[Wise Right Thing]] regardless of how it is perceived and expecting nothing in return, we will do the [[Wise Right]] thing.
