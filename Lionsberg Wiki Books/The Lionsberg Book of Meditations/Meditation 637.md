The [[Way]] towards [[Truth]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Knowledge]] lies not through the blind acceptance of preexisting religious or scientific [[Propositions]], but rather through the Process of experimental and experiential [[Progressive Falsification]] that continually strips away more and more layers of elementary illusion to reveal more of [[Reality]]  and [[Ultimate Reality]] as they actually are. The Gold of [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]] are forever purified through [[Refining Fire]] that burns away the dross. The beauty of a sculpture is revealed by removing all the stone that is not the emergent Masterpiece.
