The Spirit of [[God]] is within us. 

[[Salvation]] and the [[Kingdom Of God]] are accomplished by and through the Spirit of God. 

Therefore the [[Potential]] for Salvation and the Kingdom of God are also within us. 

The Spirit of God, Salvation, and the Kingdom all arise from within, from the direct personal [[Communion]] of the spirit of a being, and all beings, with the Spirit of God.
