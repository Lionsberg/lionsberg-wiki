# Meditation 182

Our fear of death manifests in proportion to that which we primarily identify our self with. If we primarily identify our self with our temporal and spatial body, we know the end is rapidly and inevitably approaching, and we grasp and cling to the physical life in our bodies. If we primarily identify our Self with the universal and eternal Spirit and God, we know that there is no such thing as an end, and we celebrate and welcome each subsequent transformation of Life as birth and progress.
