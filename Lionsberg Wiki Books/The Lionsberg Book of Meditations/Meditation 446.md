We must rediscover the separation of [[Faith]] and [[Belief]]. 

In [[Science]], there can be no dogmatic beliefs. There are only hypotheses that we are testing, wrestling with, and actively working to disprove. 

LIkewise in [[Faith]], there can be no dogmatic beliefs. There is only [[Covenant Relationship]] with [[God]]. 

[[Faith]] binds us to the living [[Ultimate Reality]] *of* [[God]], *not* to a fixed set of religious propositions or beliefs *about* [[God]].  

Any perceived God that is not a Mystery beyond our comprehension is a [[False Idol]].
