The things that truly cause us to Love our spouse, or our children, can be hinted at with words, but never fully articulated to those who have not met those we love. They cannot even be fully articulated to our Selves. True Love flows from a depth of Loving, Understanding, and Knowing that is far [[Deeper]] than Words. 

So too is it with [[God]]. The depths of awe, wonder, and ecstacy that drive us ever deeper into the Source of Being can never be reduced to words, or explained to those who have not experienced It. 

To Know the [[Way]], one must live It and experience It.
