The arrogant religious pharisees who distort the Spirit of Christ and mislead humanity must stand before One and All and give an account. Jesus always pointed up and back towards [[God]], showed people the [[Way]] towards manifesting the same Spirit that was within him, prayed that others would be one just as he was one, and prophesied that through the power of the [[Spirit]] we would do even greater things than he did. He would not have said these things were they not True. The [[Spirit]] and [[Power]] of [[God]] belongs to [[All]], is within All, and beckons All to discover the Way forward and back towards God.
