There is a Force that produces ever more flourishing, abundant, integrated and enlightened [[Life]]. 

There is a Counter Force that seeks to drag this emergent and enlightening Life down towards [[Disease]], [[Death]], [[Dis-Integration]], and [[Endarkenment]]. 

All Life must be strengthened and made ever more Aware so that it can resist, confront, and overcome this Anti-Force.
