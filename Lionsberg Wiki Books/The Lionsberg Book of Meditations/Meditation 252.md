We have shared dinner and [[Dialogue]] with Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Russians, Chinese, Americans, Persians, and people from dozens of other tribes and nations. While their televisions and leaders sow [[Fear]], [[Division]], and [[Deceit]], the [[Good]] people of the towns and cities all seem to long for the same future that [[All]] [[Creation]] longs for. None of the Good families desire [[War]] or conquest. They want their children to have the opportunity to develop towards the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] and flourish in a safe, harmonious, and [[Properly Ordered]] [[Society]]. If we [[All]] agreed to [[Help One Another]] towards this [[Meta Goal]], we would see that the vast majority of our present conduct and way of being is entirely antithetical to achieving that outcome. If we [[Value]] what we say we value, our present actions and [[Way of Being]] is insane. We should rapidly become sober and sane before we destroy our last best chance to achieve our Goal.
