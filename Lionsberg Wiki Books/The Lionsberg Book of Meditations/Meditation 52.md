# Meditation 52

Beware of the vast array of ideas and insights in the Cultural Storehouse you inherit. In the great Storehouse are indeed many gems, treasures, and elixirs of immeasurable Worth. And mixed in among them are false idols that will turn you to stone, poisons that will rot your bones, and chalices that look holy but will consume you. Discern and test each one carefully against the Spirit within you, and do not take up anything that seems even remotely impure.
