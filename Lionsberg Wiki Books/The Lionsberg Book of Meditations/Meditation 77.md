# Meditation 77

It may feel strange at first, but if you do not have a living, active, direct dialogical relationship with the Source of your being and All beings, you are missing out on the single greatest and most important aspect of your existence. Talk with God. Walk with God. Breathe with God. Exist in God. It is the Ultimate Reality, so we might as well joyfully celebrate and embrace it.
