[[God]] does not desire our empty prayers, rituals, or sacrifices. 

God desires beings who are progressively unifying their [[Selves]] with their [[Source]].  

This manifests not in a few ritual prayers that punctuate our day, but in thoughts, words, and actions that reflect what the Perfect [[One]] would think, speak, and do.
