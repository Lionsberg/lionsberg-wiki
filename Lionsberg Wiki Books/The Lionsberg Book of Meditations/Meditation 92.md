# Meditation 92

If no one has given it to you before, you are hereby liberated to suspend your belief in religious propositions that do not match your [[Current Best Understanding]] of God or Reality. Set them on the shelf, do not make a judgment about them, admit that you do not know, and go search freely for Wisdom and Truth. If they are True, your Quest for Truth will lead you back to them.
