As Scientists come to posit that [[Consciousness]] might actually be [[Deeper]] than being, some have hypothesized that Consciousness is the Ground of Being. 

This is a step in the right direction, because we might say that God is at least as Conscious as the Consciousness It is creating, or has a Mind at least as intelligent as the Minds It is creating. However we must remember that just as a human being cannot be reduced to a Mind, so too can God not be reduced to a Mind. 

Just as [[Consciousness]] is [[Deeper]] than being, so too is God Deeper than Consciousness.
