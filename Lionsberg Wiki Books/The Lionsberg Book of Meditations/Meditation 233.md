We are bound together in one [[Inter-Existence]]; therefore none of us can reach [[The Goal]] unless and until [[All]] of us reach The Goal. Whatever stands in the [[Way]] of [[Any]] stands in the Way of [[All]]. Every mountain must be moved and every valley raised to make [[Way]] for [[One]] and [[All]] to progress towards their Ultimate Embrace.
