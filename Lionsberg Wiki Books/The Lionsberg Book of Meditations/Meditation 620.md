The [[Spirit]] that is fully manifest in the [[Christ]] never points to its own individuated existence and temporal embodiment as the [[Aim]]. It speaks from and points back towards the Eternal and Ultimate [[ONE]] that It calls Father in Heaven, inviting [[All]] to to become [[Perfect]], as God is Perfect, and all things to become one, as It is one with the [[ONE]]. It is the eternal Spirit that redeems, not the temporal [[Embodiment]]. Therefore Jesus said blasphemy against the Son of Man (the embodiment) would be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit would not be forgiven. The Highest Order Unity is to be found in the worship of God alone in [[Spirit]] and [[Truth]], transcendent of [[All]] individuated elements.
