One of the primary purposes of life is to progressively discover and conform our [[Consciousness]] to [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]]. This is largely done through dispensing with everything that is not [[Wise]], [[Right]], and [[True]]. 

A second purpose is to [[Progressively Realize]] our [[Selves]]. This is largely done through putting to death everything that is not Who We Are Destined To Become. 

Being progressively raised towards New [[Life]] often feels like Death.
