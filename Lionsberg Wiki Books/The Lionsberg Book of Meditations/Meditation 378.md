One of the categories humanity has created is [[Nature]]. We should not assign all the best or all the worst features of some parts of Nature to All parts of Nature. Nature is pure, innocent, and benevolent, with a thousand ways to nurture and sustain. She is also a devouring monster with a thousand ways to destroy the naive, unaware, and unprepared. The [[Potential]] for both manifestations is within her. 

Another category humanity has created is [[Humanity]]. We should not assign all the best or all the worst features of some parts of Humanity to All parts of Humanity. Humanity is pure, innocent, and benevolent, created in the image of God. She is also a devouring Tyrant that rapes, pillages, and destroys in demonic ways. The [[Potential]] for both manifestations is within her. 

Neither Nature nor Humanity is inherently Good or Evil. We are all part of one System that must learn to balance, regulate and co-operate in order to bring out the very best manifestation of All for the Good of All.
