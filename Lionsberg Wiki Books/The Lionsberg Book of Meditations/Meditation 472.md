The first order of business in putting ones life in order is to figure out what within is [[Temporal]], and what within us is [[Eternal]]. 

The [[Eternal]] must lead, and the [[Temporal]] must follow. 

The [[Spiritual]] must lead, and the Material must follow. 

The [[Metaphysical]] must lead, and the [[Physical]] must follow. 

This is the opposite of the logic that drove the [[Old World]] towards its collapse.
