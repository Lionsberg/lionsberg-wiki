# Meditation 193

True Love is not about loving and helping others when they love and help you. The basest of people do this. True Love is willing to lay down its own life, even for those who are actively destroying it. This is why Jesus was able to suffer and die, while blessing those torturing and murdering him. "Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do."
