It is more difficult for a rich man to enter the [[Kingdom of God]] than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Paradoxically, it is the same for the excessively religious. 

The rich cannot fit through the eye of the needle because of the excess *possessions* they cling to. The religious cannot fit through the eye of the needle because of the excess *propositions* they cling to. 

This is why releasing wealth and returning to childlike [[Faith]] are *requirements* of the [[Way]], and *predecessors* to the Realization of the Kingdom.
