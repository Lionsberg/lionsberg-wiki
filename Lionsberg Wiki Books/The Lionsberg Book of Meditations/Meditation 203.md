# Meditation 203

Consciousness is Potential. Consciousness is Power. Consciousness is Creative Capacity. The capacity to create is also the capacity to sustain and destroy. Infinite potentials are present in the inception of consciousness. It is therefore the duty of each bearer of consciousness to feed within itself the Potential which creates and sustains flourishing and abundant Life and Liberty for All. This requires that one simultaneously integrate all its Potentials to be a creator, sustainer, and destroyer, and to consciously deploy all Potentials only in in service of that which is Right, True, and Good, which is flourishing and abundant Life, Love and Right Relationship between One and All.
