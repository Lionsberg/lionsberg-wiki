There are many deep [[Issues]] and sicknesses in the collective soul of the world. Their symptoms of [[Hunger]], [[Poverty]], [[Disease]], [[Corruption]], [[Oppression]] and [[Suffering]] cannot be cured from the outside in.

To vanquish these diseases of the soul, a generation of soul healers must arise to progressively heal them Selves and their world.
