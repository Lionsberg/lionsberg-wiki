# Meditation 179

There is a lightness and a heaviness, an aliveness and a deadness, a lightness and a darkness, that can be physically experienced in the world as weight, but cannot be measured with a scale. For instance, when a limb is beset with "cold" energy, it feels heavy and stiff to the healer, and they struggle to lift it and work with it. As they clear the "cold" energy and the vital energy once again flows freely, the limb becomes light, soft, and playful, and can be easily lifted with a few fingers. Western doctors who treat only the outward physical manifestations of the deeper energetic flows do not understand this, and millions suffer and die prematurely due to this ignorance.
