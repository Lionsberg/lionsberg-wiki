# Meditation 200

People who look at the surface of things will remain perpetually confused. Remember that consciousness is prior to all things, including your own consciousness. To understand a phenomena, observe the fruit it is producing, and then see beyond the manifestation in order to understand 1) the consciousness, that would produce 2) the perception, that would produce 3) the thoughts, that would produce 4) the words, that would produce 5) the actions, that would produce 6) the fruit. In this way one can know the deeper spirit or essence from which events are manifesting. Always look deeper. Look deeper.
