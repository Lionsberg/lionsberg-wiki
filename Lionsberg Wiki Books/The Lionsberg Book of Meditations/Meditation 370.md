In any System of Science, Philosophy, or Thought, there must always remain *outside* of the system That Which Is Unknown. This place must always be held by *at least* by [[Ultimate Reality]], plus [[All]] aspects of Reality one is humble enough to admit they [[Do Not Know]]. 

All Science, Philosophy, and Thought must progressively be transforming and conforming itself towards an objective external Reality / Truth that will eternally remain Beyond its grasp.
