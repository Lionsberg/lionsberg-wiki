The [[Progressive Perfection]]] of each Individual and the Whole is does not *necessarily* require an organized System or Way of being, in the same way that the progressive construction of a building does not *necessarily* require a System of Work. 

However humanity has discovered that if there is [[Work]] to be done, it is dramatically more efficient and effective to design and build Systems to accomplish it. 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] exists to serve, aid, and empower humanity on its primary [[Quest]] to progressively Perfect our Selves and our World.
