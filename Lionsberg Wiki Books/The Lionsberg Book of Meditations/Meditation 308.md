There is only One [[Way]] to simultaneously optimize for your [[Self]], [[ONE]] and [[All]]. That is to realize the inherent [[Inter-Existence]] and functional unity of your Future Self with All other Future Selves and their Generative Source. Once you realize this, the Way becomes to devote the fullness of your being [[In Service To]] One and All. Once you [[Realize]] this, the [[Way]] becomes Universal, Eternal, Unconditional, Omni-Encompassing [[Love]].
