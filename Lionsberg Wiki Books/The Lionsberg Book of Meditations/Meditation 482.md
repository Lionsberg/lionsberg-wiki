One human in isolation has [[Self-Awareness]], and the [[Conscious Agency]] to intervene in the course of events and co-create their emergent [[Reality]]. 

Two or three humans together also have a collective [[Self-Awareness]], and the [[Conscious Agency]] to intervene the course of events, and co-create their emergent [[Reality]]. 

A tribe or nation is the same. Humanity is the same. Some animals are the same. Some plants are the same. 

Could it possibly be that the Source of all this [[Self-Awareness]] and [[Conscious Agency]] would have any less of these qualities than Its Creatures?
