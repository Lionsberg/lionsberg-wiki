# Meditation 17

Each of us, by nature of our existence, carries a burden. As we struggle together up the sacred mountain towards our Destiny, let us help, and not hinder one another. Let us encourage one another. Let us lift one another up. Let us bear each other’s burdens. Let us link arms and strive together towards The Goal, by helping All others do the same.
