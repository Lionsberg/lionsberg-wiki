"Intelligent Design" is a far lower understanding than what is actually occurring between Transcendent Creator or Generative Source of the Universe, and That Which Is Being Created. 

[[God]] did not create the Universe in 7 days and then vanish. God *is* creating, now and actively, not only the Universe, but you. The Spirit of God *is* creating and transforming you. Here. Now. Everywhere. Always. 

Look deep enough and carefully enough into any aspect of Creation, and you will discover its generative Source actively at work.
