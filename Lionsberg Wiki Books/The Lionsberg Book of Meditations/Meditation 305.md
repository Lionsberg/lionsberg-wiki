[[Worksite Earth]] is just another work site. What we should be doing is working together to: 
1. Understand the Highest Intention, 
2. Analyze [[Existing Forces and Conditions]], 
3. Engage the right resources
4. Develop strategies and plans of action, and 
5. Act to transform Earth FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]]. 

Instead, a thousand competing and self-optimizing tribes are destroying the very thing that must provide for the Future of their families.
