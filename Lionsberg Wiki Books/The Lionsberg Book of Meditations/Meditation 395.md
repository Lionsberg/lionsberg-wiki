[[Good]] and [[Evil]] are dissociative energies. They cannot eternally remain in the same Domain. One will eventually overcome and push the other away. Only one thing can ultimately occupy the Highest Place in a given Domain. If That Which Occupies The Highest Place is Good, it will vanquish [[Evil]], [[Corruption]], and [[Injustice]] and establish [[Righteousness]]. If it is Evil, it will parasitically predate upon the Good until it destroys both its self and the Domain. 

As soon as Evil, Darkness, or Parasites are identified, they must be vanquished and driven out, and the conditions that led to their emergence transformed, no matter how painful the lifesaving intervention might be. Temporal pain and sacrifice are often required for eternal [[Salvation]], [[At-One-Ment]], and [[Flourising]].
