We grew up in a culture deceived by leaders who arrogantly stood in luxury behind their cultish religious and political walls, basked in unearned moral superiority, and condemned those they judged to be heathens to hell. These same people claimed to be following in the footsteps of [[Christ]], while embodying the very aspects of corruption and deceit Jesus so clearly condemned. 

Humanity must wake up and begin measuring those who profess themselves to be religious and political "leaders" against the Standard, Words, and Perfection that Jesus and all the prophets have spoken of. Were they to do so and speak Truthfully despite the consequences, even to the death, the [[Old]] Structures would fall, and the [[New World]] could rise from the ashes.
