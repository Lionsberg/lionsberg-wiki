[[God]] is the only [[ONE]] capable of truly Guiding us in the [[Way]]. 

To follow God, we must unite our [[Desires]] to the desires of God; we must unite our [[Vision]] to the Vision of God; we must unite our [[Purpose]] to the Purpose of God; we must unite our [[Loves]] to the Loves of God; We must unite our [[Values]] to the Values of God. 

To follow God, we must get to Know God.
