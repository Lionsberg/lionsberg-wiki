The Conscious Force that animates and guides the Universe is no less, and indeed far greater, than the Conscious Force that guides your body. 

The Conscious Force animating and guiding the Universe is *at least* the aggregate of the Conscious Forces guiding All the trillions of creatures, in All places, and All times. 

When you liberate your Self from the illusion of  [[Spacetime]], you [[Realize]] that It is not only what It is at least; It is far more.
