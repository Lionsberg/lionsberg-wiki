# Meditation 53

We destroy the souls of our children when we tell them that if they do not accept the religious propositions articulated by the religious authorities, they will go to hell. There is no difference between forcing our children to bow down to an idol made of gold, or an idol made of religious propositions. Both are false idols made by human thoughts, words, and hands. God does not dwell in the creations of humanity. God dwells in the Infinite Beyond. Tear down the false idols of Gold and Words, and return to Right Relationship with the Infinite and Ineffable One.
