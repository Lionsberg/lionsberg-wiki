# Meditation 186

No one who thinks that they "know" God through their books or their words has encountered the living Ultimate Reality that drops us face down onto the ground and renders us speechless. Religions make a grave error when they force congregants to bow down to their false idols of God, in the form of words fashioned by human mouths and hands. By strict definition, God is beyond human comprehension, and therefore the words we use to describe God are at very best tools and signposts pointing the Way towards Ultimate Reality.
