If we are to wage war for the future of [[Life]] and [[Society]] on [[Earth]], we must carefully consider who or what the [[Enemy]] is, and where it lies. When X billion of us, [[All]] of us, consider this question we will be shocked to discover that the evil lies within, and therefore must be first vanquished within. Within what? Within us. Within our families. Within our businesses. Within our communities. Within our churches, mosques, and temples. Within our tribes and nations. When we draw the map of battle, if it does not cut right through the heart and soul of every human being on Earth, we have mis-drawn the map. If your map of battle has you fighting against another tribe or nation as the externalized evil, beware lest you win, and discover yourselves to be murders and thieves, deserving of the [[Hell]] you have created for your self.
