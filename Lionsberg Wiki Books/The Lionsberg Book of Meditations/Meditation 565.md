People often [[Fear]] that the Higher Order [[Unity]] found in [[God]] will swallow up their Individuation and [[Diversity]]. 

This could not possible be further from the [[Truth]]. It is precisely the [[Realization]] of the underlying [[Unity]] that dispels [[Fear]], and creates the [[Conditions]] for Flourishing and Abundant Diversity to not only Manifest, but also be celebrated and embraced. 

The [[ONE]] Image we are conforming our [[Selves]] towards contains within Itself the fullness of [[All]] past, present, and future manifestations of [[Life]].
