You cannot serve God and material wealth. True wealth is the ability to provision our current and future Selves, our families, and All current and future generations of Life. 

This "eternal" flourishing of [[All]] can never be bought or forged with money. It can *only* arise and emerge from a genuinely healthy, flourishing, and properly ordered Society and Living System that abundantly provides for [[All]]. 

If we dedicate the fullness of our being to co-creating a world of [[Flourishing And Abundant Life]] for All, our future Selves will also partake in this abundance. 

The actions required to co-create a flourishing and abundant world for [[All]] in service of [[ONE]] are the same actions that lay up 'treasures in heaven.'
