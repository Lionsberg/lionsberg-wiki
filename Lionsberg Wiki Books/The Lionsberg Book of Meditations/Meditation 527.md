The closer we get to [[God]], the more clear, simple, and refined our [[Faith]] becomes. 

The more clear, simple and refined our [[Faith]] becomes, the closer we find our Selves to All other people of Faith, and indeed to All creation. 

The closer we find our Selves to All Creation, the more united we are with Life and its Source.
