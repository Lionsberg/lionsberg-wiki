# Meditation 211

Considered the power of sexual selection. Out of the myriad of men, the feminine chooses one. Deep below the level of her awareness, out of the myriad of sperm, the feminine egg chooses one again. Out of millions of potentials, the feminine brings forth the future which it consciously and subconsciously is choosing. The progression of a species is not random. In a society where women are valued and free, they are pursued by men vying to become worthy of their Love, and out of the infinite Potentials, they select the future Potential that is best.
