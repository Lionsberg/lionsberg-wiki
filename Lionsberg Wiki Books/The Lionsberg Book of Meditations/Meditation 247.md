Just as we cannot blame "them", neither can we blame [[Satan]] or [[Evil]]. Yes there is evil, but could not humanity, standing together in partnership with [[God]] and [[One Another]], overcome [[Evil]] with [[Good]]? If you believe in the [[Spritual Realm]] of [[Evil]], you must believe in the [[Spritual Realm]] of [[Good]]. If you believe in the spiritual realm of [[Good]] and [[Evil]], you must believe that Good is ultimately able to triumph over evil. If you believe that we can overcome evil with Good, you must gather up all your fellow humanity and get to [[Work]]! We must lose the abstraction, and understand that this is *our* battle to fight, now, at this very moment.
