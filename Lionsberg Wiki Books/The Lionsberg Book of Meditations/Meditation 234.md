When one picks up a piece of trash or heals a wound, they [[Improve]] the world. When one improves their spirit and soul, they become the kind of being who can do miracles in the moments and places they touch. One act of improvement in the world is a single act. One act of improvement in a soul is an infinite act, because it transforms and improves the [[Generative Source]] of improvement in the world.
