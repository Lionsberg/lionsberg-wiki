# Meditation 185

I find that the greatest duty I have to temporal embodied Life is to speak and articulate the Logos to the best of my ability, no matter how misunderstood or inadequate that might be. This is because the next great stop on humanity's progression towards its Destiny is for the knowledge of God to cover the earth like floodwaters. The knowledge of God is infinite and non-propositional. It is a knowing that is far deeper and higher than words. However the words that can flash forth like like lightning are the sword that can loose the bonds of ignorance and oppression that are dividing humanity against itself, the [[Living System]], and [[God]]. Political and Religious words bind people into intellectual and spiritual prisons. Spiritual words liberate and break every chain. The spiritual path leads towards absolute transcendence of every limited construct of the Mind, so that the Spirit can truly and freely commune with God.
