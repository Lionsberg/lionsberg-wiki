[[God]] did not manifest us in embodied form only to have us submit our Minds to irrational man-made religious propositions on faith. 

We exist to come to know God ever more deeply through our direct personal experience as our Consciousness explores [[Reality]] and [[Ultimate Reality]]. 

The organization of human experience through [[Science]] only comes into conflict with [[Religion]] when either fails to conform itself to [[Truth]]. 

[[Truth]] reconciles, redeems, and liberates [[All]] things.
