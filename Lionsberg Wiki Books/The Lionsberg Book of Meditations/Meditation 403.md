The idea that [[Salvation]] is attained through signing a statement of faith, buying indulgences, or subordinating your spirit and intellect to a set of prescribed religious propositions is an evil sham propagated by empire, oligarchy, and false religious authorities. 

Salvation, liberation, and flourishing and abundant Life can only be attained through the genuine transformation of ones being in partnership with God.
