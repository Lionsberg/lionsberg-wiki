The [[Wisdom]], [[Truth]], and [[Logos]] that uphold the Universe and create and sustain Life do not belong to any one book, religion or tradition. The Wisdom and Truth of [[God]] cannot be confined or contained in any one tradition, for the [[Spirit]] of God is manifest throughout [[All]] [[Creation]], declaring the glory of God and beckoning All creation towards Its Self. 

Encounters with the Spirit that creates and sustains the universe have inspired books and traditions in nearly every time and place. Each of these, like a painting or portrait, reflects and conforms itself in varying degrees of faithfulness to the underlying invisible [[Ultimate Reality]] it aims to make visible and represent.
