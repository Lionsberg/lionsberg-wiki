Every [[Good]] parent hates when when [[Division]], [[Strife]], and [[Discord]] are sowed within their family unit. We Know from both Spirit and Scripture that God hates those who sow division and strife among His children. 

Despite knowing this, we interpret the words of the prophets who speak the words of God in a way that divides and sows hatred and fear among tribes, nations, and peoples. 

All such religious abuse and deceit is not the [[Way]].
