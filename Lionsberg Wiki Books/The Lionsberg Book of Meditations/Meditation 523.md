The manifest Spirit of God descends, as it were, from the transcendent God, into the seed that contains the Potential for the unique expression of each being. If the conditions are right, it brings that being into existence through its creating and sustaining Power. The Consciousness present in that being, once  individuated, must then rediscover the [[Way]] to reascend and reunite its Self back to God. 

If this can occur while the [[Embodiment]] is still flourishing, then one can be born again as a pure conduit of the Flow of the Spirit of God, from God, to God, through God.
