The element of you that fears [[Pain]], [[Suffering]] and [[Death]] is present in All beings. 

The element of you that longs to create, heal, and flourish is present in All beings. 

In Light of this, all thoughts, words, and actions that cause pain, suffering, or death are [[Sin]]. 

All thoughts, words, and actions that advance progress towards flourishing and abundant Life are Good.
