The [[Way]] towards [[Reunion]] with the manifest [[Spirit of God]] within, and the transcendent [[Source]] Beyond, lies through [[Focus]] and [[Concentration]] on the [[One Thing]], which is ultimately [[One]], or [[God]]. The [[Absolute]] Center and [[Aim]] of existence. 

One's [[Energy]] follows one's [[Attention]]. 

The [[Flow]] and dissipation of embodied [[Attention]] outward towards [[All]] the objects of sensory [[Perception]] must be Consciously reversed, withdrawn, and refocused back towards its Center and [[Source]]. [[Consciousness]] and [[Attention]] flowing from [[One]], must be withdrawn from [[All]] and returned to [[One]]. This Divine [[Reunion]] of [[Manifest]] and [[Transcendent]] Spirit and Consciousness is what creates the Divine Spark of [[Co-Creation]].
