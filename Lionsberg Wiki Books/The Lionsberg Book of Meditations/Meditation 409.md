If we are not willing to live by [[The Spirit]], we must live by [[The Law]].

He who lives by [[The Law]] will die by [[The Law]]. 

The Law is a tyrannical and exacting master and judge. If we are committed to our own destruction, and the destruction of others and our environment, it can, will, and must rise with a vengeance to control and compel us. 

Yet if we simply commit, to the very best of our ability, to live by the Spirit, we are liberated from [[The Law]] into the freedom, joy, and abundance that can only be found in [[The Spirit]]. 

The precondition for liberation from oppressive and tyrannical Law is the true transformation and commitment of the spirit, heart, mind and soul to live from, and only from, the Spirit. 

If we truly govern our selves in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]], we do not need tyrants to govern us.
