If we are to take pride in any [[Identity]], let it be the [[ONE]] Supreme Identity that unites us [[All]]. 

If we are to pledge allegiance to any nation or kingdom, let it be the [[ONE]] Supreme Nation and Kingdom that unites us [[All]]. 

We are [[All]] the [[Children of God]], co-creating the [[Kingdom of God]], by the power of God, [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]].
