# Meditation 23

First, do no harm. First, do no evil. First, do not transgress the free-will or well-being of another. Next, help the one you Love. Next, make the one you Love bigger. Next, make the one you Love One and All. Next, help One and All towards their Goal. When your will, intention, and action are one with the will and intention of One and All, you are in the center of the ultimate purpose, destiny, and Goal.Â
