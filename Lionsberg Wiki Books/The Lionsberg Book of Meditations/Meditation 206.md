# Meditation 206

You are not your thoughts. You are not your emotions. You are not your words. You are not your actions. Within you is something far deeper and more powerful, which is capable of transforming and guiding your thoughts, words, emotions and actions. This is the power of Spirit. Spirit has the power to consciously modulate, to regulate, to mediate, to lead, and to guide All things. To escape the tyranny of Reality, one must learn to transcend it, in order to overcome it, dance with it, and guide it in the infinite ecstasy of co-creation.
