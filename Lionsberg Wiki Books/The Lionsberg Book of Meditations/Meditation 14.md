# Meditation 14

We are united by the pain we all experience. We are united by our suffering. We are united by our mortality. We are are united by our life. We are united by our love. We are united by our air. We are united by our water. We are united by our soil. We are united by our creative consciousness. We are united by our Source. We are are united by our Sustainer. We are united by our Destination. We are united by our Goal.  One is in All, and All is in One.
