The [[Way]] is to rediscover and salvage from the depths of the corrupted, blind, and failing religious structures the eternal and universal [[Wisdom]], [[Principles]], [[Values]], Practices, and [[Way]] that created beings can organize and conduct their Life in [[Harmony]] and [[Right Relationship]] with the other beings around them, and the Source of All being.
