There is no such thing as a sacred book of [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]] that belongs to any one tribe, sect or religion. 

Anything that is Loving, True, Wise, or Good is inherently universal and eternal in nature, belongs to [[All]], and is intended to bless, elevate, and enlighten All beings in All Times and All Places.
