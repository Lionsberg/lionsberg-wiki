Who is [[Enlightened]], and who is Endarkened? 

Because progressive enlightenment involves the transformation of consciousness in relationship to the Ultimate Consciousness that always remains both within and Beyond, enlightenment, like all worthwhile things, is not a matter of attainment, but a matter of [[Progressive Realization]]. 

Even the most endarkened person has within them the seed and Potential of Light, and even the most enlightened person has an infinite journey ahead of them. 

When the [[Christ Consciousness]] manifest in Jesus, it still pointed towards greater Wisdom and Knowledge that were Beyond it in the [[ONE]] who Jesus called His Heavenly Father.
