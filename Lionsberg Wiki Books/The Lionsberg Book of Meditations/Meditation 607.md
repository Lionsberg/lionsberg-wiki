[[Wisdom]] lies first in knowing what to [[Fear]]. The [[Fear of God]] is the beginning of [[Wisdom]]. A cell in a body fears the suffering and death of the Whole that is creating and sustaining All cells more than it fears its own suffering and death. Each cell is willing to suffer and die so that [[All]] cells may live. Likewise, a human should fear the suffering and death of community, society and creation more than it fears its own death. We are [[All]] cells in One embodiment.
