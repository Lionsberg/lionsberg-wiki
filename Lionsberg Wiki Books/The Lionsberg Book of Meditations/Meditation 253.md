Great atrocities and exploitations have been carried out in the name of the United States, Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, Great Britain and many other nation states. These atrocities do not reflect the quality, intention, or desires of the families in those territories, the vast majority of whom, like you, are struggling towards [[Light]], [[Life]], and [[Liberty]] against great odds. If we are to [[Heal]] the world, the [[Good]] families of the towns and cities must get to know [[One Another]], and discover that except where our minds have been poisoned by propaganda and deceit, we share the same overarching and uniting [[Goals]], [[Values]], [[Fears]], [[Desires]], and [[Aspirations]] for our children and the kind of world we would like them to flourish in. This is genuinely hard to believe for those who have been taught their entire lives to hate and fear the "[[Others]]".
