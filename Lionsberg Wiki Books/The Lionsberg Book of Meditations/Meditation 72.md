# Meditation 72

We have something in our mind, we speak it, and then we embody it into form. One has the universe in mind, speaks it, and embodies it into form. We are All a part of the living sacred embodiment of All that One has in Mind. You are holy. The ground is holy. The air is holy. The water is holy. Life is holy. We are All the living, breathing, pulsating embodiment of what One has in mind. Until we All more fully and consciously understand this, let us All [[Act As If]] this were True. If this were True, we would Love and treasure every one and every thing as if it were a part of our Self, because we would know it to be so.
