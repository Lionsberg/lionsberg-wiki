[[What If]] it was not only possible, but a far more direct path towards the flourishing, harmonious, and abundant future we all desire, to get there by [[Way]] of [[Blessing]], [[Peace]], and [[Love]], rather than Hatred, [[Fear]], and [[War]]? If the people of [[Peace]] and [[Love]] arose and stood together, we could simply arrest the few [[Psychopaths]] who would destroy our children and our world through war and [[Oppression]], just as the community naturally intervenes to stop a bully on a playground. The [[Bullies]] and [[Tyrants]] have no right. The governments of our world belong to us, and exist only by us and for us, to serve us and help us. All "[[We The People]]" must do is arise and stand together in the [[Light]], insisting on [[The Future We All Desire]], tolerating nothing short of it, and striving together towards it, and everything else becomes [[Possible]] as a result of the partnership and [[Right Relationship]] of [[Humanity]], the [[Creator]], and All [[Creation]], working together in [[Harmony]] towards [[The Goal]].
