The weakest, poorest, and most vulnerable have the greatest [[Right]] to the abundance offered by this world. 

The strongest, richest, and most powerful have the greatest [[Responsibility]] to Consciously [[Co-Create]] that abundance for [[All]]. 

[[Rights and Responsibilities]] in the [[Kingdom Of God]] accrue according to a reverse Logic to what drove the [[Old World]]. In the [[Kingdom Of God]], Rights accrue first to the weak, and Responsibilites accrue first to the strong.
