# FAQ - Is There an Overview That Can Help Me Understand Better?

Yes. [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] is progressively articulating [[Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future]] and a series of [[Lionsberg Wiki Books]]. These books lay out the context, vision, plan and system in structured narrative form. 

Jordan's writing in [[Above The Chaos]] may also be useful to you.
