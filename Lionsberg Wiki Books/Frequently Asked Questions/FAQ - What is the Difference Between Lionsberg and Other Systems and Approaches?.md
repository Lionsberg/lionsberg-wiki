# FAQ - What is the Difference Between Lionsberg and Other Systems and Approaches?

Lionsberg is different from other systems because it is citizen-led and based on whole systems thinking, and the principles of love, compassion, and equality for All. It also empowers people and communities to take control of their own development in order to make local progress towards shared goals and values. Lastly, it is a system which has been set up from its inception on the principle of "One and All" and on the basis of empowering all people and all living systems in all times and places to Co-Create and flourish in Harmony. 

This stands in contrast to most existing systems and approaches, which are siloed or fragmented in nature, led from the top down, and often are set up for the primary benefit of one group, tribe, or nation. 

Lionsberg is perhaps the first structured system in history set up *in service to [[ONE]], for the benefit of [[All]]*.
