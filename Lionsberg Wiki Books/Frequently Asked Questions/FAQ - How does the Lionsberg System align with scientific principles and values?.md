# FAQ - How does the Lionsberg System align with scientific principles and values?

The Lionsberg System aligns with scientific principles and values in several ways. Firstly, it is based on the principle of collaboration and cooperation, which is a fundamental aspect of scientific research and discovery. By connecting and empowering individuals and communities to work together towards shared goals and values, the Lionsberg System encourages the sharing of knowledge and resources, and the collective pursuit of wise solutions to the grand challenges we face.

Secondly, the Lionsberg System is based on the principle of continuous improvement, which is central to the scientific method. By constantly seeking new and innovative ways to solve problems and create opportunities, the Lionsberg System encourages experimentation, iteration, and learning, which are all key aspects of scientific research and discovery.

Thirdly, the Lionsberg System is based on the principle of stewardship, which is in alignment with the scientific principle of sustainability and right relationship to reality as it actually is. By prioritizing the protection and regeneration of the environment and natural resources, the Lionsberg System encourages responsible and sustainable use of resources, which is vital for the health and well-being of all living things, and the vitality of the world that science seeks to understand.

Fourthly, the Lionsberg System promotes the use of data and research to inform decision making within the context of wisdom, which is crucial for evidence-based decision making that is fundamental to the scientific method. By encouraging the use of objective, verifiable evidence to guide actions, in addition to wisdom and intuition, the Lionsberg System promotes a balanced approach to decision making that combines the best of both worlds.

Finally, the Lionsberg System is based on the principle of humility, which is essential for scientific inquiry. It is grounded in the understanding that the universe is beyond the realm of human knowledge and comprehension, and therefore everything must be expressed in terms of hypotheses and our current best understanding, rather than absolutes or dogma. This humility allows for a constant questioning and re-evaluation of assumptions and beliefs, which is crucial for scientific advancement and progress.

In summary, the Lionsberg System aligns with scientific principles and values by promoting collaboration, cooperation, continuous improvement, stewardship, balanced decision making, and humility. It is an approach that is grounded in the pursuit of knowledge and the application of that knowledge for the betterment of all. It is an approach that is in harmony with the scientific method and the pursuit of truth, and it is an approach that is in harmony with the best practices of modern science.
