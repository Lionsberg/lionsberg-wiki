# FAQ - What Is The Structure Of Lionsberg?

Lionsberg is structured first as a sovereign, autonomous and voluntary association of individuals, organizations, and communities, co-operating across various [[SpatioTemporal Domains]].  

It exists prior to the authority of All but [[ONE]] on the basis of the Divine Right and Moral Obligation of individuals and localities of goodwill to join together as diverse aspects of [[One Body]].  

From Time to Time, We incarnate locally appropriate structures to interface with various authorities and accomplish various goals. In order to facilitate the emergence of LIONSBERG on Earth, We forged a [[Provisional Structure]].
