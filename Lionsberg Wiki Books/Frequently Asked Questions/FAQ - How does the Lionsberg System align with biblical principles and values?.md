# FAQ - How does the Lionsberg System align with biblical principles and values?

We respect that like in every system of belief, there are many different interpretations of what it means to be a follower of Christ, and how biblical principles and values should be applied in action. 

The Lionsberg System is based on principles of citizen-led impact and stewardship, guided by values of truth, love, justice, stewardship and wisdom in service of One and All. These principles and values align with the teachings of Jesus, who encouraged us to seek first the highest overarching and uniting will and intention of God, on earth as it is in heaven. The Lionsberg System aims to empower individuals and communities to take control of their own development and to work together to create a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all. 

In the Bible, Jesus taught about the Kingdom of God and how it is within us, and how we should seek it first in order to have all our needs met. (Luke 17:21) He also taught about loving our neighbor as ourselves, (Mark 12:31) and about serving the least among us. (Matthew 25:40) The Lionsberg System is built on these same principles of love, compassion, and service to others, which are at the core of Christian beliefs.

Additionally, the Lionsberg System also places a strong emphasis on stewardship, which is the responsible management of resources entrusted to us. Christians are called to be good stewards of the resources God has given us, and to use them to serve and benefit others. (Genesis 2:15) The Lionsberg System promotes this same idea of stewardship, encouraging individuals and communities to take responsibility for managing their resources in a way that benefits everyone.

To the best of our understanding, the Lionsberg System is entirely consistent with biblical principles and values, properly understood and applied in a way that extends the Spirit of God's Love to all people and all creatures without exception. 

Some fundamentalist Christians might take issue with the inclusion and love that Lionsberg directs towards all people and all creatures. While we believe it is entirely biblical to love, serve, and meet all people just as they are, some Christians in certain denominations place greater emphasis on their judgment of eternal salvation and converting people to certain religious or doctrinal beliefs and practices. The Lionsberg approach leads with love, seeks to meet pragmatic needs, solve pragmatic problems, and relieve suffering, while entrusting eternal judgment to God. This is in keeping with Jesus's wisdom "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." (Matthew 7:1-2). As humble sinners trying to improve our lives and our world and get a little better every day, we seek to connect with, serve, and support all, while honoring Jesus's warning: "He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone" (John 8:7), and extending to others the mercy we believe triumphs over judgment (James 2:13).

In summary, the Lionsberg System aligns with the values and principles of Christianity as best we currently understand them. It encourages individuals and communities to work together in service of one another and to take responsibility for creating a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all. It is not a political or religious movement, but a spiritual and philosophical one that aligns with the wisdom and principles of Jesus, who encouraged us to seek first the highest overarching and uniting will and intention of God, on earth as it is in heaven.

If you are a Christian, we welcome you and look forward to learning and working together to see the highest will and intention of God fulfilled right here in our lives, our society, and our world.
