# FAQ - How Does Governance Work in the Lionsberg System?

The Lionsberg System is based on a decentralized, autonomous, and citizen-led governance model, where power is pushed away from potential centers of accumulation and vested in the hands of the people. This means that individuals and communities are empowered to take control of their own development and to work together to create a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all. The result is a decentralized and empowered network of individuals and communities working together towards shared goals and values. Governance in the Lionsberg System is based on the principles of citizen-led impact and stewardship, guided by values of truth, love, justice, stewardship and wisdom in service of One and All.

The Lionsberg System encourages the formation of local and regional governance structures that are representative of the diverse communities and individuals that make up the network. These local and regional structures are responsible for making decisions and implementing policies that align with the shared goals and values of the network as a whole.

The Lionsberg System also encourages the formation of specialized governance structures to address specific issues and challenges that may be unique to certain regions or communities. These specialized governance structures are responsible for developing and implementing policies and programs that are tailored to address the specific needs and challenges of their respective regions or communities.

The Lionsberg System also encourages the use of technology and digital platforms to facilitate collaboration and decision-making among individuals and communities. The use of technology and digital platforms allows for greater transparency and participation in governance, as well as the ability to share information and resources more efficiently.

At the federal level, there is a small governance body that functions to help the entire system of systems navigate towards its goals and values. This body is divided into four distinct branches: executive, legislative, justice, and regulatory. The executive branch is responsible for implementing the decisions made by the other branches, the legislative branch is responsible for articulating rules and policies, the justice branch is responsible for interpreting the rules and policies and resolving disputes, and the regulatory branch is responsible for ensuring that each sub-system as well as the entire system of systems stays within its ranges of tolerance. 

The Lionsberg System is based on a principle of sovereign, autonomous, citizen-led impact and governance from the bottom up. This means that the system is designed to push power and authority away from centralizing systems and back to the people. This is in stark contrast to traditional top-down systems of governance and empowers individuals and communities to take charge of their own development and help one another progress towards their shared goals and values. To help individuals, organizations, and communities better govern themselves, the Lionsberg System sets forth an Ideal that is contained in the Prototype, and encourages, enables and supports efforts to implement and improve individual and local self-governance. 

The Lionsberg System is designed to be a decentralized, bottom-up system that empowers individuals and communities to govern themselves, while also ensuring that there is clear vision, principles, goals, and values to align society, as well as a system of checks and balances in place to prevent abuse of power. This proper balance between aligned vision, autonomy and oversight allows for the the human and natural systems as a whole to effectively navigate towards their goals and values, while also ensuring individual and local freedom and autonomy. 

In summary, the Lionsberg System is a decentralized, autonomous, and citizen-led governance model that empowers individuals and communities to take control of their own development and to work together to create a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world for all. At the federal level, there is a small governance body that functions to help the entire system of systems navigate towards its goals and values, divided into four distinct branches: executive, legislative, justice, and regulatory. This system is based on a principle of sovereign, autonomous, citizen-led governance from the bottom up, pushing power and authority away from centralizing systems and back to the people.
