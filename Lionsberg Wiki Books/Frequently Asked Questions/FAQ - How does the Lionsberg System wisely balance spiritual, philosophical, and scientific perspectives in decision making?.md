# FAQ - How does the Lionsberg System wisely balance spiritual, philosophical, and scientific perspectives in decision making?

The Lionsberg System balances spiritual, philosophical, and scientific perspectives in decision making by incorporating a holistic approach that takes into account the wisdom, knowledge, and evidence from all three perspectives.

Firstly, the Lionsberg System recognizes the importance of spiritual wisdom and inner guidance in decision making.

This ensures that decisions are made with the long-term well-being of all living things in mind, utilizing both spiritual wisdom and inner guidance, and evidence-based decision making. This approach promotes personal growth, self-awareness, and the development of spiritual practices while staying grounded in facts and evidence, which is vital for the health and well-being of all living things.
