# FAQ - What If We Disagree?

The Lionsberg System recognizes that disagreement is a natural part of any decision-making process, and embraces difference and conflict as an essential part of discovering and illuminating higher wisdom. The system is based on a decentralized, citizen-led governance model, where individuals and communities have the autonomy and authority to make decisions that affect their own lives and communities. Decision making is done in small groups, where individuals and communities work together to identify shared goals and values, and to develop and implement solutions that align with those goals and values.

In the process of decision making, the Lionsberg System respects the inner guidance of each individual, and any individual can raise legitimate and substantive objections to a proposed solution or decision in the governance groups they participate in. These objections are then taken into account and addressed as part of the decision-making process, with the goal of finding a solution that is in alignment with the shared goals and values of the group and is acceptable to all involved. 

The system also includes a small representative governance body at the federal level that helps to navigate the entire system towards its goals and values. This governance body is divided into four distinct branches: executive, legislative, justice, and regulatory. The executive branch is responsible for implementing and enforcing decisions and policies, the legislative branch is responsible for creating laws and policies, the justice branch is responsible for interpreting laws and mediating disputes, and the regulatory branch is responsible for overseeing and regulating various aspects of the system.

Self-governing groups that are unable to internally resolve conflicts or disputes are able to seek the assistance of the justice branch, who can help mediate conflict in a wise way. In addition, since the system is one of entirely voluntary participation from the bottom up, citizens who do not see eye to eye with groups they are a part of can leave those groups or communities in order to find other self-governing groups that feel more aligned and coherent. 

In summary, the Lionsberg System recognizes that disagreement is a natural part of any decision-making process, and it is designed to handle disagreements in a constructive and collaborative way. The system encourages the use of a proper balance between wisdom-based and evidence-based decision making, respects the inner guidance of each individual and provides a process to address and resolve any objections that are raised. It also includes a small governance body at the federal level that helps to navigate the entire system towards its goals and values, while also ensuring that individuals and communities have autonomy and authority over their own lives and decisions. The goal is to find solutions that are in alignment with the shared goals and values of the group and are acceptable to all involved.
