# FAQ - How Does Lionsberg Work?

Lionsberg works by leveraging the collective intelligence, energy and creativity of people and communities to help one another solve problems and create opportunities in new and innovative ways. It uses a decentralized and participatory approach to problem solving and governance, where individuals self-organize into small groups and are empowered to take action and create solutions that work for them, for their communities, and for the planet. 

This enables the poly-centric implementation of the wisest solutions, patterns, and prototypes in an intensely individual / local / bioregional Way. 

Most importantly, it enables the distributed network of sovereign and autonomous participants to function as One Body.
