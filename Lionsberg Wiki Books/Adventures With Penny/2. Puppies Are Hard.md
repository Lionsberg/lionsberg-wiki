# 2. Puppies Are Hard 

Puppies are hard. 

But Penny was amazing, and learned quick. 

The funny thing was, it was not so much her learning, but Us. 

The first night... she slept through it. 

Within a week, she had gained a pound and was house trained unless We were sloppy and didn't pay attention. 

It was obvious that she was *smart*. Like *really smart*. 

And really strong. 

She was no pushover. 

And she really liked to bite. Everything. Especially if it had to do with feet.
