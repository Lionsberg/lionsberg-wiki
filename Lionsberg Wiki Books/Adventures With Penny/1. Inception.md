# 1. Inception 

Since she could speak, Emma wanted a puppy. 

So finally, after [[Jordan]] passed away, We got her one. 

We get intuitive messages. 

We perceive them from different sources, but the easiest Way to think about it generally is via the Spirit of [[One]]. 

So as it were, on October 31, 2024, We got pinged that it was Time to look again. 

We began Our search, and there she was. 

The cutest little white and merle fluffball gazing out from the pages of Destiny. 

Over years of research, We had arrived at the dream of a medium-sized Bernedoole - Bernese Mountain Dog x Poodle. 

This was even better. Her mom was a Sheepadoodle (Old English Sheepdog x Poodle), and her dad was a Bernedoodle. The result was the cutest fluffball anyone has ever seen. 

On November 1st, 2024, We brought her home. All eight pounds of her.
