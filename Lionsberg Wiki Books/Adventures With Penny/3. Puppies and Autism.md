# 3. Puppies and Autism

One of Our loves is a moderate autist. 

Bringing a puppy into a house with an autistic woman is a challenge. 

Our particular form of autism manifests among other things as a need for things to be in perfect order and routine. 

Among the many ways to shatter [[Order]] and [[Routine]] is to get a puppy. 

By the second week We had experienced enough trials and tears to know that We had to either really recommit to her, or return her to find another home. 

After a few hours of heart to hearts with Our girls, We all recommitted. It was an important moment. 

Relationships are hard. Commitment is hard. Change is hard. Life is relationship, commitment, and change. 

We are All in this together.
