# V.C. How analysis relates to the Lionsberg System

Analysis is a critical component of the Lionsberg System, and is essential for ensuring that everyone is working together in an informed, wise, and effective way towards shared goals and objectives. 

The Lionsberg System is designed to integrate the efforts of individuals, teams, organizations, and communities towards a shared Vision of the best possible future we could achieve together, and to help everyone work together effectively towards that Vision across generations.

This requires not only a shared understanding of Vision and [[Where We Are Going]], but also a shared understanding and Analysis of [[Where We Are]]. Understanding Where We Are forms the starting point for planning the Quest towards Where We Are Going. 

In the Lionsberg System, analysis starts with a shared understanding of the current Reality, including the challenges and opportunities that exist, and the forces and conditions that must be transformed to advance towards our shared goals and objectives. It looks fearlessly at even the most difficult realities, while maintaining faith and hope that the Vision can be achieved. Analysis helps to inform decision-making, and to ensure that everyone is working together effectively towards a shared understanding of the current Reality and the steps that are needed to address the challenges and opportunities that point the Way towards [[The Goal]]. 

The Lionsberg System provides guidelines and best practices for conducting effective analysis, and for using the results of that analysis to inform decision-making and to continuously improve our vision, planning, and action. By conducting regular analysis, and by using the results of that analysis to inform our work, individuals, teams, organizations, and communities can ensure that they have a clear understanding of the current Reality, and that they are working together effectively towards shared goals and objectives.
