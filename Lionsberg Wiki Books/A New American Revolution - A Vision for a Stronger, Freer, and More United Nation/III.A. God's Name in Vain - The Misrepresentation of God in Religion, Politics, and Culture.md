# III.A. God's Name in Vain - The Misrepresentation of God in Religion, Politics, and Culture

The American Dream was founded on the principles of liberty, justice, and equality, which are rooted in the belief that all people are created equal and deserving of respect and dignity as children of the divine Creator. This belief in the Divine origin of life requires that each individual be treated as if they possess something of the Divine within them, as if they were created in the Image of God.

However, throughout American history, the ideals of God and the American Dream have often been misused and distorted, particularly in the realms of religion, politics, and culture.

In the realm of religion, the name of God has been invoked to justify discrimination, oppression, and violence instead of promoting compassion, justice, and love. Religious leaders and institutions have sometimes been co-opted by those in power to maintain the status quo and preserve their own interests, rather than serving as a voice for truth and wisdom, and the marginalized and oppressed. For example, in the past, some religious leaders in the South taught segregation and white superiority as God's plan, which eroded the true meaning of God's nature and character.

In politics, the name of God has been used to justify wars, policies, and actions that go against the principles of liberty, justice, and equality. Political leaders have invoked the name of God to serve their own interests, rather than acting in the service of the common good. Politicians have pandered to religious sects, movements, and denominations, manipulating religious fears and passions for their own benefit, and dividing the faithful population against one another. 

In culture, the name of God has been used to promote division and intolerance instead of unity, understanding, and compassion. Cultural wars fought in the name of God have only served to undermine the American Dream and destroy the bonds of unity that are so essential for a healthy and thriving nation. They have caused confusion and disillusionment among people, who rightfully question the false claims and unjust actions taken in the name of God.

The misappropriation of the name of God in religion, politics, and culture is a betrayal of not only the American Dream and its principles, but of the universal and eternal foundation upon which they stand. It is a failure of leadership, vision, and the American Spirit. The true American Spirit, rooted in the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God," is a spirit of compassion, justice, and love for all God's children and all creation. To achieve its full potential and realize the ideals of the American Dream, this ultimate uniting spirit must be rediscovered and restored.
