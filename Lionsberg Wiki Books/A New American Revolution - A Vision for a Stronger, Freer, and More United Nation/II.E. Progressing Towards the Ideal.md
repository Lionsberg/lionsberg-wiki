# II.E. Progressing Towards the Ideal

The American Dream has always been a work in progress, a journey towards a more perfect union where liberty, justice, and equality are not just ideals, but a reality for all. 

As we will explore in the next chapter on The Disillusionment, it is not possible read the previous sections without our minds flooding with all the ways that America has fallen short, from the very beginning, it comparison to the ideals it claims to aspire to. 

How is it possible to claim we believed that all people were created equal and endowed with inalienable rights, when discrimination and injustice was enshrined in our founding documents, people were enslaved, Native Americans were violently dispossessed of their lands, women were not allowed to vote, and racial segregation remained the norm for generations? 

Each generation must be measured not against the Ideal or who we have become, but against the past that they were arriving from. We are still to this day woefully inadequate and unjust, but look how far we have come, and look at our present spirit and desire to continue to improve! 

We look back with terror on the sins of our past, however we can also celebrate the fact that although we are still imperfect, we are far closer to the Ideal than we used to be. And as we look back on the flaws and inadequacies in the inception of this nation, we can celebrate that although it was an imperfect effort, it was a massive step forward that laid the foundations for who we have become today, and who we have the opportunity to become tomorrow. 

Despite the challenges, obstacles, and inadequacies along the way, Americans have managed to keep sight of the Goal, and have continued to move forward, step by step, towards the Ideal.

From the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's suffrage, to the civil rights movement and the ongoing struggles to root out our remaining prejudices and injustices, Americans have somehow managed to remain at the forefront of progress and change. These efforts have not been easy, and they have often met with resistance, but they have demonstrated the unrelenting spirit of the American people to pursue the ideal and make it a reality.

It is important to recognize that progress is not always linear, and that there will always be setbacks and challenges along the way. But what is truly remarkable about America is its ability to learn from its mistakes, to heal its divisions, and to continue moving forward towards the Ideal and Dream. 

This progress is not the work of one generation, but the result of the collective efforts of millions of Americans who have worked together, across political and cultural divides, to create a better future for themselves and for their children. It is a testament to the power of the American Spirit and the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God", which is able bring people together and repeatedly achieve what appeared impossible.

As we look towards the future, it is essential that we continue to build on this progress, to overcome the challenges of our time, and to work together to create a better world for all. This requires a steadfast commitment to the ideals of liberty, justice, and equality, and a willingness to work together, in partnership with God and one another, to create a brighter future for all.

In this way, the American Dream is not just a destination, but a journey, a constant striving towards the ideal, and a reminder that together, in partnership with God and one another, we can achieve the impossible.

It remains a struggle for each generation to strive ever closer to the Light, but the grace of God we are indeed progressing. God's grace has brought us safe thus far, and somehow, God's grace will lead us on.
