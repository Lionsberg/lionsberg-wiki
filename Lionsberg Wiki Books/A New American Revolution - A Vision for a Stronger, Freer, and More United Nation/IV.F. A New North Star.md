# IV.F. A New North Star

The New American Revolution requires a new North Star, a new-yet-eternal guiding principle that will inspire and motivate the American people in their journey towards a better future. For too long, the American people have been adrift, lacking a clear sense of direction and purpose. The North Star of the past, the American Dream, has become obscured by political division, economic inequality, cultural decay, and a crisis of values and ideals. 

A new North Star must be a principle that unifies the American people, that inspires and motivates them to work together in partnership with God and one another towards the common good. It must be a principle that is rooted in the timeless and universal ideals reflected in the American Ideal, and that is capable of guiding America towards a brighter future, a future of unity, justice, and compassion for all.

This new North Star must be a principle that is embraced by all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, socioeconomic status, race, religion, or any other factor. It must be a principle that is accessible to all, that is relevant and meaningful to all, and that is capable of guiding Americans throughout the generations. 

The new North Star must be a principle that is grounded in the highest and most timeless ideals, and that is capable of inspiring and motivating the American people to work together to co-create a better future. It must be a principle that is rooted in compassion, justice, and truth, and that is capable of guiding America towards a future of prosperity, peace, and happiness for all.

When the American Dream fails, or grows dim and corrupted, we can always rediscover a New North Star in the words of the Spirit that unites us all, "One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All."

In short, the New American Revolution requires a new-yet-eternal North Star, a New guiding principle that will inspire and motivate the American people to advance together in our journey towards the best possible future for All, and that will serve as a beacon of hope and a symbol of the revivified and restored American Spirit. This can be found in words that we hope and pray will someday be the lived reality for all God's family: One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.
