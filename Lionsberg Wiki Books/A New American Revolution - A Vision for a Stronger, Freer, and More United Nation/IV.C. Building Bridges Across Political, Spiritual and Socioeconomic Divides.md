# IV.C. Building Bridges Across Political, Spiritual and Socioeconomic Divides

The New American Revolution requires a bridging of the political, spiritual, and socioeconomic divides that have plagued America for far too long. Political division, fueled by the increasing polarization of the political landscape, has left the American people deeply divided and mistrustful of one another. Socioeconomic inequality has created a situation where the wealthy and powerful are able to maintain their influence and further their own interests, while the voices of the marginalized, the poor, and the "regular folks" are often not heard. Spiritual divides have pitted people against one another, leaving society fractured and helpless in the face of a decaying culture and a broken economy. 

To overcome these challenges, the New American Revolution must be a revolution of unity and cooperation, where people from all walks of life come together to co-create a better future for all. This requires a commitment to building bridges across political, spiritual and socioeconomic divides, to creating opportunities for dialogue and collaboration, and to creating a culture of compassion, justice, and equality where all people and all voices are heard and honored. 

Building bridges across political and socioeconomic divides requires a commitment to bridging the gaps between different groups and interests and to finding common ground on which to stand. It requires a willingness to listen to and understand the perspectives and experiences of others and to work together to find solutions that benefit everyone and serve the common good. This also requires a willingness to challenge the systemic barriers to socioeconomic opportunity and to work towards a more just society.


The New American Revolution must be a profound restoration of the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God", and a rediscovery of the Spirit that unites us All. This means rejecting the forces of division that have taken root in our society, and embracing the values and principles that have always been at the core of the American Ideal. It means rejecting the culture of greed, entitlement, division, and self-interest that has threatened the American Dream, and embracing the values of hard work, faith, courage, sacrifice, and service to God, our neighbors, our country, and all God's family around the world. 

Building bridges across political and socioeconomic divides also requires a commitment to addressing the root causes of division and injustice, including corruption, poverty, disengagement, and lack of access to quality education, meaningful work, meaningful community, financial resources, and affordable healthcare and childcare. It means working to create a more just and equitable society where the American Dream is not just a future vision, but a present opportunity and reality for all.

In short, the New American Revolution must be a spiritual revolution of unity and cooperation, where the American people come together in partnership with God and one another to build bridges across political and socioeconomic divides, to create a more just, secure, and abundant future for all.
