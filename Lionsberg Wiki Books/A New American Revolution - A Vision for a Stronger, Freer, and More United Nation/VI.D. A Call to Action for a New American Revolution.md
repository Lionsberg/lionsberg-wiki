The convergence of the Meta Crisis, the American Crisis of Confidence and Faith, and the New Vision and Plan presents a critical moment for the American people, a moment that demands a bold and decisive response. The future of America, and the world, depends on the choices and actions that the American people take in the coming days, weeks, and years. 

Faced with what it perceived as an existential threat, a previous generation of Americans set forth a bold plan to put a man on the moon within a decade. Faced with an even greater threat, this generation now has a decade to land our country and our world on a safe trajectory towards a brighter future. 

This is a call to action for a New American Revolution, a revolution of the spirit, mind, and heart, that will empower the American people to reclaim the noble vision, ideals, and values that have made America great in her best times, and to work together in partnership with God and one another to co-create the brighter future we all desire.

This revolution is not a revolution of violence or coercion, but a revolution of love, wisdom, and the relentless pursuit of truth, justice, and prosperity for all. It is a revolution that requires the American people to rediscover the joys and responsibilities of a citizen-led society, to embrace the values of hard work, faith, courage, sacrifice, and service to others, and to work together in partnership with God and one another to meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities at hand. 

This revolution is a call to action for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, socioeconomic status, race, religion, or any other factor. It is a call to action for the American people to awaken, arise and unite around a shared New Vision and North Star, to tap into the power and potential of the American Spirit, and to work together in partnership with God and one another to forge the future we all seek. 

It is time for the American people to once again take up the mantle of leadership and responsiblity, and to exercise their unique power in service of all tribes, nations, and peoples. It is time for the American people to leverage their strength to lift up the world, starting with the weakest, most vulnerable, and least able to lift themselves.

It is time for the American people to reclaim their birthright of freedom, agency, and responsibility, and to forge a brighter future for themselves, their communities, and their world. This is the moment, this is the time, this is the call to action for a New American Revolution.

It is time for the American people to answer the call of history and to step up to the challenge of our times. This New American Revolution is an opportunity for the American people to come together, to heal the wounds of the past, and to forge a new and better future for all. It is a call to action for the American people to rediscover their sense of purpose, to reclaim their faith in the American Dream, and to rekindle the American Spirit.

This revolution is not just about fixing the problems of the past, but about co-creating a new and better future. It is about reimagining, redesigning, and rebuilding the political, social, economic, and religious systems that serve the American people, and about creating a new and shared New Vision and North Star that is rooted in timeless and universal values, and capable of guiding America towards a future of unity, justice, and prosperity for all.

This revolution is not just about the American people, but about all people, everywhere. The future of America is intertwined with the future of the world, and the American people have a unique opportunity and a special obligation to use their strength, wisdom, and influence to lift up the world, and to help create a brighter future for all.

The time has come for the American people to seize this moment, to embrace the challenge of our times, and to answer the call to action for a New American Revolution. The future of America, and the world, depends on it.
