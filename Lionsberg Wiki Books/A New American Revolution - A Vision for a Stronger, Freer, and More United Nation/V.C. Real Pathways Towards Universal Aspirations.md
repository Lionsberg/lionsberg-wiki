The New American Revolution requires not only a [[New Vision and Plan]], rooted in timeless and universal values, but also real and accessible pathways towards achieving this vision. The American people must be empowered with concrete and actionable steps that they can take to bring the New Vision into Reality, and co-create the better future we all desire. 

These pathways must be accessible and relevant to all citizens, regardless of political affiliation, socioeconomic status, background, race, religion, or any other factor. They must be inclusive and just, and they must be designed to empower the American people to work together in partnership with God and one another to meet the challenges, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities that lie ahead.

The real pathways towards universal aspirations must be rooted in decentralized [[Citizen Led]] entrepreneurship, innovation, and collaboration. They must be designed to empower the American people to work together to create new solutions, to advance new technologies, and to build new partnerships that can drive progress and growth across the country and around the world.

The real pathways towards universal aspirations must also include systems of education, empowerment, and engagement. They must be designed to help the American people to acquire the knowledge, skills, and capacities they need to participate fully in the life of the community and the nation, and to take an active and engaged role in shaping the future of the country and the world.

The real pathways towards universal aspirations must also rise from the principles of freedom, agency, and responsibility. They must be designed to empower the American people to take charge of their own lives and communities, to make their own choices, and to be responsible for their own actions, and they must be designed to help the American people to work together in harmony to build a brighter future for all.

The real pathways towards universal aspirations must be an inspiring call to action, a call to arise and unite to reclaim the noble vision, ideals and values that have made America great in her best times. They must be a concrete and actionable plan for the American people, a plan that is designed to empower and inspire, and that provides real and achievable opportunites to progress towards the New Vision and brighter future.
