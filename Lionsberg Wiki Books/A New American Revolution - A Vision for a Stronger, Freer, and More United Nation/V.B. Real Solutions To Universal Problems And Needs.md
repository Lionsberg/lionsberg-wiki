# V.B. Real Solutions To Universal Problems And Needs

The New American Revolution must go beyond simply stating ideals and values, and must actively work towards providing real solutions to the universal problems and needs facing America and the world today. This requires a deep understanding of the root causes of these problems and a commitment to addressing them in practical, innovative, and regenerative ways.

Solving universal problems and needs requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, drawing on the best and brightest minds from all fields and sectors, and utilizing the full range of human knowledge and experience. This requires a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives, to learn from past failures and successes, and to embrace new ideas and approaches.

The solutions to universal problems and needs must be grounded in the eternal values and principles reflected in the American Ideal, and they must be guided by the highest principles of truth, justice, and love. They must be aimed at promoting the well-being of all individuals, communities, and the planet, and they must be regenerative and just, ensuring that all future generations have the opportunity to develop towards their potential and thrive.

The solutions to universal problems and needs must also be based on a deep understanding of the interconnected and interdependent nature of the world and its systems, and they must be aimed at promoting the well-being of all, not just a privileged few, one tribe, one nation, or one people. This requires a commitment to addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality, conflict, and environmental degradation, and to working together to create a more just and regenerative world for all. 

These solutions must be citizen led, and localized by the distributed network of autonomous and empowered individuals, organizations, and communities around the world. 

In short, the New American Revolution must provide real citizen led solutions to universal problems and needs, solutions that are based on the highest principles and values, that are inclusive and just, and that are aimed at promoting the well-being of all individuals, communities, and the planet. These solutions must be innovative, practical, and regenerative, and they must be the result of a collaborative, interdisciplinary and multi-generational approach to problem solving, designing, and building.
