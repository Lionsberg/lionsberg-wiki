# V.A. A New Vision, Eternal Values

The New American Revolution requires a New Vision and North Star to guide America towards a brighter future, one that is grounded in timeless and universal values, and that is capable of inspiring and motivating the American people to work together in partnership with God and one another towards the best possible future for all. This New Vision must be rooted in the eternal and universal principles and ideals reflected in best aspects of the American Ideal, and it must be capable of guiding America towards a future of unity, justice, and prosperity for all.

The New Vision must also be a vision of hope and possibility, one that is capable of inspiring the American people to dream and to strive forward towards a brighter future. It must be a vision that is inclusive, accessible, and relevant to all citizens, regardless of political affiliation, socioeconomic status, race, religion, or any other factor. 

While vibrant and New, this New Vision must also be based upon the universal and eternal and universal values of truth, liberty, love, justice, stewardship and wisdom. It must be capable of inspiring the American people to rediscover the joys and responsibilities of a citizen led society, to embrace the values of hard work, faith, courage, sacrifice, and service to others, and to work together in partnership with God and one another to meet the needs, solve the problems, and capture the opportunities at hand in all times, all places, and through each subsequent generation. 

This New Vision must also be a call to action, a call to arise and unite to reclaim the noble ideals and values that have made America great in her best times. It must be a vision that transcends political ideology, cultural divides, and socioeconomic status, and that unites all Americans in a common cause and a shared mission to build a brighter future for all.

This New Vision must be more than just a set of ideas or aspirations. It must be a living and breathing reality, a guiding principle that is embodied in the choices and actions of the American people. When the New Vision and eternal Values are embodied in the American people, then they will also be reflected in the policies and practices of the American government, corporations and society that have been transformed from within by the citizens who animate them.

In this way, the New Vision must become an inspiring force for positive change, a catalyst for a brighter future, and a beacon of hope for generations to come. Ultimately, the New Vision must be a call to arise and unite to reclaim the American Spirit, and a call to co-create a brightest possible future for all.
