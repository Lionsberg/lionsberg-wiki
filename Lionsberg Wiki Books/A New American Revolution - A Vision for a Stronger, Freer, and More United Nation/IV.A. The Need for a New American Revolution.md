# IV.A. The Need for a New American Revolution

The American Dream is in crisis. Political division, socioeconomic inequality, corruption, exploitation, declining global influence, and a crisis of culture and values are all threatening the very foundations of the American Ideal. If America is to realize its full potential, and to restore its place as a beacon of hope and a leader in the world, then it must undergo a [[New American Revolution]].

A New American Revolution must go beyond simply changing laws, policies, and leaders. It must involve a profound transformation of the American Spirit, a reclaiming of the faith, values, and ideals that have made America great. This revolution must be a spiritual one, rooted in the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God."

A new American Revolution must be a revolution of the heart, a reclaiming of the universal compassion, justice, and love that are at the core of the American Ideal. It must be a revolution of the mind, a rediscovery of the wisdom, principles, and values that have sustained flourishing civilizations for thousands of years. It must be a revolution of the soul, a restoration of the American Spirit, the spirit that unifies us, lifts us up towards the highest ideals, and impels us to work together in partnership with God and one another to co-create the best possible future for all creation. 

The need for a new American Revolution cannot be overstated. America is at a crossroads, and the choices that we make in the coming years will determine the future of the nation and the world. The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: a house divided against itself cannot stand. If America is to overcome the challenges of political division, economic inequality, and cultural decay, then it must undergo a new American Revolution, a revolution that reclaims the American Spirit and restores the American Dream.
