# II.D. The Early Rise of America as a Global Leader

The rise of America as a global leader began with its establishment as an independent nation, its overthrow of tyranny, and its adoption of the principles of liberty, justice, equality. These founding principles would guide the nation's growth and development over the centuries, shaping its character and inspiring its people to strive for greatness.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, America began to establish itself as a leader in the Western Hemisphere. The country's commitment to its founding principles, as well as its abundant natural resources and rapidly growing economy, made it a beacon of hope and prosperity in the region.

As the 19th century progressed, America's global influence continued to grow. Its thriving economy, driven by industry and innovation, established it as a major player on the world stage, and its expanding military and diplomatic reach allowed it to play an increasingly influential role in world affairs. America's role as a global leader was cemented in the 20th century, when it played a critical role in the outcome of both World War I and World War II.

In World War I, America joined the Allied Powers in the fight against the Central Powers, providing the decisive military and economic support that helped turn the tide of the conflict. America's entry into the war marked a new phase in its evolution as a global power, and it played a crucial role in the shaping of the post-war world.

In World War II, America played an even greater role, as it emerged as one of the primary military and economic powers of the world. The country's unwavering commitment to victory, combined with its vast industrial and technological resources, made it a dominant force in the defeat of the Axis powers. America's leadership during this conflict would have a profound impact on the post-war world, as it emerged as a superpower, exerting its influence on global affairs through its military, economic, and cultural power.

After World War II, America continued its rise as a global leader, playing a central role in the development of the post-war international order. During the Cold War, America's military and economic might, combined with its steadfast commitment to the principles of liberty and democracy, made it a critical player in the struggle against Soviet-led communism. The country's efforts to contain the spread of communism and defend the free world helped ensure the stability and security of the global order, and its leadership helped to usher in a new era of prosperity and progress.

Over the last several decades, America has continued to play a vital role as a global leader, shaping the future of the world through its military, economic, and diplomatic power. However over the last 20 to 30 years, its star has begun to fade. Its commitment to its founding principles, as well as its spirit of innovation and progress, continue to inspire people around the world, and its leadership continues to play a critical role in addressing the world's most pressing challenges. At the same time, the revelations of its hypocrisy in recent times and throughout its history have begun to tarnish and challenge its standing in the world, and even in the hearts and minds of its own citizens. Like all human experiments, the United States has turned out to be intensely human, and intensely flawed. Its ongoing role in the world is rightly in question.
