The New American Revolution must ensure equal opportunity and access for all citizens, regardless of political affiliation, socioeconomic status, race, religion, or any other factor. This means creating systems and structures that are designed to empower all citizens without exception to participate fully in the life of the community and the nation, and to take an active and engaged role in shaping the future of the country and the world.

Equal opportunity and access for all citizens requires a deep commitment to justice, and a willingness to forthrightly address the systemic barriers and inequalities that have long plagued American society. This means creating a level playing field, where all citizens have access to quality education, healthcare, and socioeconomic opportunities, and where all citizens are treated equally and with dignity and respect, regardless of race, religion, gender, or any other factor.

Equal opportunity and access also requires a commitment to socioeconomic justice, and to addressing the issues that have been at the heart of the decline of the American Dream. This means creating an economy and society that works for all citizens, not just the privileged few, and that is designed to provide real economic opportunities and security to all Americans, regardless of their background or status.

Equal opportunity and access for all citizens is essential to the success of the New American Revolution, and to the restoration of the American Spirit.  It requires a new and renewed commitment to the American Ideal, a commitment to the values of unity, justice, and equality, and to the idea that every citizen has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It requires a commitment to working together in partnership with God and one another to build a brighter future for all, and to restore the American Spirit for generations to come.
