# II.A. The Uniting Spirit - One Nation Under God

The American Dream is not just a vision of material prosperity, but a dream of a nation united by a common purpose, a shared spirit, and a higher calling. This unifying spirit is rooted in the reality that we are all "One Nation Under God." The phrase "One Nation Under God" is not simply a national or political slogan, but a deep-seated conviction that we are all equal children of one loving Creator, bound together by a common humanity and a shared destiny.

The ideal of "One Nation Under God" is at the heart of America's founding principles. It is indeed the source of the equality with which all are created and deserve to be treated equal. The founding fathers recognized that true liberty, justice, and equality can only flourish when they are rooted in a higher purpose and a divinely-ordained moral order and law. They understood that the quest for prosperity, while important, was not the ultimate goal of the nation. Instead, they saw the American Dream as a pursuit of the highest and most noble ideals, a dream of a society that is guided by the wisdom of God, and a world that is transformed by love and compassion.

This unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God" has been a source of strength and resilience for America throughout its history. It has inspired Americans to rise to the challenges of their time and to strive towards the ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all. The American Spirit of honor, integrity, and enterprise that has characterized this nation from its earliest days is a testament to the power of this unifying spirit to bring people together, to heal division, and to create a better world for all.

As we rediscover the spirit of America, it is essential that we remember this unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God." For it is only when we are united by a shared vision and a common purpose that we will be able to overcome the challenges of our time and create a brighter future for ourselves, future generations, and our world. A better future for a select group can never be a better future for all. In this way, the unifying spirit of "One Nation Under God" serves as a beacon of hope and a North Star, reminding us that we are all part of something greater than ourselves, and that together in partnership with God and one another we can realistically achieve the impossible.
