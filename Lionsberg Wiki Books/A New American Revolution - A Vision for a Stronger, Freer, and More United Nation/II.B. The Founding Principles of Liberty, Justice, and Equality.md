# II.B. The Founding Principles of Liberty, Justice, and Equality

The principles of liberty, justice, and equality have been central to the American Dream since the nation's founding. These principles have not only defined the American experiment, but they have also inspired people around the world to fight for their own freedom and dignity. The founding fathers recognized that these principles were not just political ideals, but also moral and ethical imperatives that are rooted in the natural law and divine wisdom.

Liberty, the cornerstone of American society, is the right to be free from oppression, tyranny, and unjust interference by government or others. The founding fathers believed that this right is essential for human flourishing, and that it is an inalienable gift from the Creator. They enshrined this principle in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and fought to establish a government that is of, by, and for the people.

Justice, the second pillar of the American Dream, is the principle that all people are equal under the law and deserve equal protection of their rights and dignity. The founding fathers recognized that the pursuit of justice is not just a legal or political obligation, but a moral imperative that requires us to act with fairness and compassion towards all. They believed that this pursuit requires us to uphold the rule of law, and to hold those who abuse their power accountable.

Equality, the third and final principle of the American Dream, is the belief that all people are created equal and deserving of equal opportunities and treatment. The founding fathers believed that this principle was not just a political ideal, but a fundamental truth that is rooted in the natural law and divine wisdom. They recognized that equality requires us to eliminate discrimination, and to promote the common good and the well-being of all.

These founding principles of liberty, justice, and equality are not just abstract concepts, but living realities that have been brought to life by generations of Americans who have fought for them. Today, as we face new challenges, it is more important than ever that we rediscover the spirit of these principles and that we recommit ourselves to their pursuit. For it is only through the rekindling of the spirit of liberty, justice, and equality that we will be able to overcome the challenges of our time and forge the better future we all desire.
