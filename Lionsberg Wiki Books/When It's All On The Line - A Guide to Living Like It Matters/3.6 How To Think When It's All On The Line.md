# 3.6 How To Think When It's All On The Line

When faced with high-stakes situations, our thinking can be clouded by stress, fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. Our minds may become overwhelmed, making it difficult to think clearly and make effective decisions. In these situations, it is essential to have strategies for thinking that can help us [[Navigate]] our [[Way]] forward. Here are some key principles and practices for thinking when [[It's All On The Line]]:

## 1. Take a step back

When we are under pressure, our thinking can become very narrow and focused. We may get trapped in a cycle of [[Anxiety]] and [[Worry]], which can make it difficult to see the bigger picture. To counteract this, it can be helpful to take a step back from the situation and gain some perspective. This might involve stepping away from the problem for a few moments, going for a walk, praying, or talking to someone we trust. By stepping back from the situation and trying to rise above the [[Chaos]], we can see things from a higher perspective and gain clarity and objectivity, which can help us make better decisions. 

## 2. Analyze the situation

Once we have gained a higher perspective, we can start to analyze the situation more objectively. This involves looking at the facts of the situation, rather than our emotions or assumptions. We may need to gather more information or do some research to get a clearer understanding of the situation. It can be helpful to use a structured approach, such as a [[Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and Trends (SWOTT)|SWOTT Analysis]], to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats and trends of the situation. By analyzing the situation in this way, we can develop a more strategic and informed approach to problem-solving.

## 3. Consider multiple perspectives

When we are in a high-stakes situation, we may be tempted to rely solely on our own thinking and judgement. However, this can be limiting and may result in missed opportunities or blind spots. It can be helpful to seek out multiple perspectives and viewpoints, including those that may challenge our own assumptions and beliefs. This might involve seeking out Wisdom and advice from trusted allies or friends, or consulting with wise counselors. By considering multiple perspectives, we can gain a more complete and nuanced understanding of the situation, which can help us make more effective decisions.

## 4. Use creative thinking

High-stakes situations often require creative and innovative solutions. To think creatively, we may need to transcend our perceived limitations, and be open to new and unconventional ideas. This might involve brainstorming or mind-mapping, or simply asking ourselves "what if" questions. By using creative thinking, we can generate new and innovative solutions to complex problems.

## 5. Evaluate the risks

When we are facing high-stakes situations, there are often significant risks involved. To make informed decisions, we need to evaluate the risks and weigh them against the potential rewards. This involves considering worst-case scenarios, as well as the likelihood and impact of different outcomes. It can be helpful to use a risk analysis framework, such as a decision tree, bow tie risk analysis, or scenario planning, to evaluate the risks and make more informed decisions.

## 6. Take action

Ultimately, thinking when [[It's All On The Line]] is about moving towards [[Wise Right]] action. We may have the best strategies and plans in place, but if we do not take action, we will not advance towards our goals. Taking action may involve making difficult or uncomfortable decisions, or stepping outside of our comfort zone. It may also involve being resilient in the face of failure or setbacks. By taking persistent and courageous action, we can move forward and make progress towards our goals, and avoid becoming paralyzed by fear, anxiety, or analysis. As we interact with Reality, we will gain further Information to help clarify our thinking. 

Thinking when it's all on the line requires us to take a step back, analyze the situation objectively, consider multiple perspectives, seek Wisdom, use creative thinking, evaluate the risks, and take action. By following these principles and practices, we can make more informed and effective decisions, even in the most challenging of situations.
