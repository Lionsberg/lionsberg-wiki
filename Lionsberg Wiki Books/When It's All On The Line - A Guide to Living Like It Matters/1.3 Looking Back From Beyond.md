# 1.3 Looking Back From Beyond

At some point in the [[Future]], whether it's 10 or 20 years from now, or on our deathbed, we will look back on the moment when everything was on the line. When we do, what we will most want to avoid is looking back with regret.

The [[Way]] towards avoiding regret is to be and do with the fullness of our being, in the most competent way we can, towards the [[Most Worthy Aim]] we can [[Perceive]].

Those who work with the dying tell us that at the end of life, [[Regret]] is usually not about [[Sins of Commission]] or mistakes made. Instead, regret is usually about [[Sins of Ommission]]: the things we could have done but didn't because of all the reasons that, in hindsight, don't matter and shouldn't have blocked our [[Way]]. 

To avoid such regrets, we must cultivate the [[Wisdom]] to [[Discern]]  [[What Truly Matters]] and the [[Courage]] to act on it. This means setting aside [[Fear]], [[Doubt]], and [[Self-Limiting Beliefs]] and pursuing the actions that align with our deepest values and aspirations. It also means being willing to take risks, embrace uncertainty, and learn from our failures.

Ultimately, when we look back on the moments when everything was On The Line, we want to be able to say that we gave it our all and left nothing on the field. We want to know that we acted with integrity, compassion, and purpose, and that we made a positive difference in the world, however small or large.

The view from Beyond is always a clearer view. It reminds us that our time on this Earth is finite and that every moment counts. So let us strive to be and do our best when [[It's All On The Line]], not just for our [[Selves]] but for the sake of [[All]] those whose lives we touch. In the end, it is not the accolades or the material possessions that matter but the legacy of [[Love]], [[Service]], and [[A Life Well Lived]] we leave behind.
