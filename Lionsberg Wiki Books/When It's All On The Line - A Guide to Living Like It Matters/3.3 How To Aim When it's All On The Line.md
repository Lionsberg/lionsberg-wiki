# 3.3 How To Aim When it's All On The Line

[[Aim]] is the ability to direct our [[Attention]], focus, and action toward a specific target or [[Goal]]. 

When [[It's All On The Line]], having a clear,  compelling and [[Wise Right]] aim is critical to succeeding, and avoiding failure. 

To aim effectively, we must first clarify our [[Purpose]] and our [[Values]]. What are we fighting for, what principles and values do we stand for, and [[Why]]? This requires introspection, reflection, and a deep understanding of our own beliefs and motivations.

Once we have a clear sense of our purpose and values, we can set a single [[Overarching and Uniting]] [[Aim]] that integrates them into a single Goal. 

We can then begin to break down our uniting [[Aim]] into the component elements it implies, for example through a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. 

Then we can set specific, measurable, and achievable [[Milestones]] and [[Goals]] that align with our [[Aim]]. These goals should be challenging yet realistic, and should push us to stretch beyond our perceived limits.

These [[Goals]] can then be broken down into shorter term [[Objectives]] and tasks that fuel our measurable progress. 

We must also cultivate the ability to adapt our [[Aim]] as circumstances change. When faced with unforeseen [[Challenges]] or [[Obstacles]], we must be able to reassess our goals and adjust our course as necessary. 

At the same time, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to our overall [[Purpose]] and [[Aim]]. If they are [[One]] with [[God]], they are like the faithful [[North Star]] that doesn't move or change, even as the waves and the storms beset us. We must be willing to persevere through difficulties, setbacks, and failures, and to keep our focus on the long-term [[Vision]], [[Milestones]], and goals that we have set for ourselves.

To [[Aim]] effectively, we must also learn to [[Be Present]] and mindful in the moment. We must focus our [[Attention]] on the work at hand, and be fully engaged and immersed in **the process of achieving our goals**. This requires [[Discipline]], [[Practice]], and a deep sense of purpose and commitment.

Finally, we must recognize that our [[Aim]] must always and eternally remain transcendent. Our existence is not just about achieving individual success or overcoming obstacles, but about serving the [[Greatest Good]] we can presently conceive. We must strive to [[Stacking Up And Aligning|Stack Up And Align]] our personal goals and aspirations with the well-being of All others and our planet, so that we are working towards a future that is Loving, Just, and Regenerative for All. 

When [[It's All On The Line]], effective [[Aim]] requires clarity of purpose, focus, wisdom, resilience, adaptability, mindfulness, and a deep commitment to the [[Greatest Good]]. By cultivating these qualities, we can [[Aim High]] and achieve great things, even in the face of unprecedented challenges and obstacles.
