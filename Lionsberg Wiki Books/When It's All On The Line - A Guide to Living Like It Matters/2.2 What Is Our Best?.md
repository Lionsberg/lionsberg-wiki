# 2.2 What Is Our Best?

As we face into this crisis, we ask our Selves: What is our best? What is the greatest and highest thing we could possibly be and do in such moments? 

This is where the magic starts and the mystery begins. The Answer is not easy, for it lies [[Beyond]] our current [[Understanding]] and [[Perception]] of [[What Is Possible]]. 

If we were to bring the fullness of our being in harmony with its Source, all Creation, and all accumulated wisdom, knowledge, and technology, not in isolation but as One living, breathing, moving, integrated Body and Mind, what might be possible? How high could we go? What lies at the absolute top of our [[Potential]]?

The Truth is that [[We Do Not Know]]. The answer to this question can only be discovered through direct experience, by [[Embodying]] our highest [[Potential]] with the fullness of our being in the face of an unprecedented crisis.

We must acknowledge that there is a [[Power]] and [[Potential]] within us that transcends our current comprehension, beyond what we can ask or imagine, and far beyond our perceived limits. Throughout history, we have caught glimpses of this power, flashing forth from moments, people, and events that transcend the ordinary. It is something Divine, something beyond our current understanding, that manifests through flashes of brilliance and moments of sheer inspiration.

To discover our [[Best And Highest]] in times of crisis, we must recognize that we are all interconnected and interdependent beings, and that the highest expression of our [[Potential]] can only be achieved through [[Collective Action]]. We must look [[Beyond]] our individual aspirations and fears, and seek to serve the [[Greatest Good]] by embodying the qualities of courage, integrity, compassion, and purpose, and by taking collective action to address the crises we face.

Our best is not a destination, but a [[Quest]]. It is a constant [[Process]] of growth, learning, and evolution, and it is up to each of us to commit to the [[Quest]] of discovering and embodying our highest [[Potential]] in service to the [[Greatest Good]].

Something Good beyond our wildest imagination is longing to emerge and burst forth through us [[All]].
