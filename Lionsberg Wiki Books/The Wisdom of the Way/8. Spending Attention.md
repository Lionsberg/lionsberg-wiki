# 8. Spending Attention
Attending to (something) requires spending, or sacrificing, your [[Attention]] to [[Attend]] to (it).

It is a sacrifice to [[Attend]] to (something), because by doing so you forgo the opportunity to [[Attend]] to (something else). 

What you "spend" your [[Attention]] on is perhaps the most important moral decision. 

There is a nearly universal and eternal [[Opportunity Cost]] to every act of [[Perception]] and [[Attention]]. 

[[Attention]], not [[Time]], is perhaps the ultimate scarce resource that must be allocated. 

[[Time]] is fungible. [[Time]] is a subjective illusion. 

Our individual [[Attention]] is not. 

[[Time]], [[Energy]], [[Resources]], and Co-Creation all follow our [[Attention]].  

It is through our [[Attention]] that we [[Co-Create]] our [[Reality]]. 

We can only [[Attend]] to what we can [[Perceive]]. 

We can only [[Perceive]] in accordance with our [[Structure of Value]]. Our [[Structure of Value]] will be incoherent unless it is united by a [[Meta Value]]. 

Our [[Structure of Value]] is relative to our Goals. Our [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] will be incoherent unless it is united by a [[Meta Goal]]. 

Our [[Meta Goal]] and our [[Meta Value]] therefore by definition can only be [[ONE]], or the structure of our [[Reality]] will lack [[Integrity]] and will [[Dis-Integrate]].
