# 14. Out of the Antilibrary, a Library
Out of the entire Antilibrary of all the books you do not have and have not read, forge a small and carefully selected library, and read virtually nothing else until you have understood that library. 

_What a great treasure can be hidden in a small, selected library! A company of the wisest and the most deserving people from all the civilized countries of the world, for thousands of years, can make the results of their studies and their Wisdom available to us. The thought which they might not even reveal to their best friends is written here in clear words for us, people from another century._ ~ [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] 

_Read the best books first, otherwise you'll find out you do not have time._ ~ [[Henry David Thoreau]]

Reading takes [[Attention]]. [[Attention]] is moral decision. Every act of reading, and choosing what to read, is an intensely moral decision.
