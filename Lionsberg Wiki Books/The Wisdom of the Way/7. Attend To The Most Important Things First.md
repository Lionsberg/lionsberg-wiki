# 7. Attend To The Most Important Things First
Attend to the Deepest, Best and [[Most Important Things]] first. Otherwise, you will find "you do not have" [[Time]].

_Read the best books first, otherwise, you will find you do not have [[Time]]._ ~ [[Henry David Thoreau]]. 

_There are too many mediocre books which exist just to entertain your mind. Therefore read only those books which are accepted without a doubt as [[Good]]._ ~ [[Lucius Annaeus Seneca]].
