# 5. First, Do No Harm
The first and surest way to become [[Better]] is to cease from doing [[Harm]]. 

Stop poisoning the Spirit. 

Stop poisoning the Mind. 

Stop poisoning the Body. 

Stop poisoning the Society. 

Stop poisoning the Air, Water, and Soil. 

If only we could cease doing That Which Harms, and find a Way to [[Help]], a little at first, and then a little more, all things would [[Get A Little Better Every Day]] and flourish in harmony. 

_I will do no harm or injustice._ ~ The Hippocratic Oath
