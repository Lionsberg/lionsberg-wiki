# 12. Operationalizing the Wisdom of the Way
There is a Chinese Proverb which says (something like): 

_Those who know the rules of true wisdom are baser than those who love them._

_Those who love them are baser than those who follow them._

Someone like Jesus might say (something like): 

_It is not those who say ''Lord, Lord" who will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but rather those who actually do the will of our Father in Heaven._ 

A martial arts teacher might say (something like): 

_To know the Way one must live it._  

The Wisdom of the Way is well known in nearly every society. Every society has had its enlightened messengers, and Its Principles are proclaimed throughout Nature as it transforms according to them. 

What has been missing is a human species willing to actually stop destroying itself and the earth, and _operationalize_ them by harmonizing our patterns of being with the Fundamental Patterns of the One.
