# 9. Spending Time
Attending to (something) requires spending, or sacrificing, your [[Time]] to [[Attend]] to (it).

It is a sacrifice to spend [[Time]] on (something), because by doing so you forgo the opportunity to spend [[Time]] on (everything else). 

What you "spend" your [[Time]] on is crucial moral decision. 

Spending [[Time]] is different than spending [[Attention]] and [[Energy]] in that [[Time]] is a subjective illusion, whereas [[Attention]] and [[Energy]] are not. 

A Way to liberate ones Self from the false constraints and illusions of [[Time]] is to subdivide it into progressively smaller [[Units of Time]], and to be fully and Intentionally present and attentive to [[What Matters]] in each frame. 

The Masters of the Way appear to so to be, because they are present and deploying [[Attention]] and [[Energy]] to move in frames or sub-units of [[Time]] that most cannot [[Perceive]]. 

As a starting point, consider 15 minutes a [[Units of Time|Unit of Time]], and try to be present, intentional, and attentive relative to the Most Important Thing in that frame. 

Then, detach completely, be empty, reprioritize, and reengage another 15 minute Unit of Time. 

An incredible amount of [[Work]], [[Rest]], or [[Relationship]] can be accomplished in 15 minutes (or 15 seconds) of true Presence and Attention.
