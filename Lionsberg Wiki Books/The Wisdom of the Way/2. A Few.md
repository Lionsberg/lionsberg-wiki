# 2. A Few 

A few of the highest [[Quality]] are far superior to many that are mediocre. 

For example: 

In [[Knowledge]], it is far better to know deeply a few things that are True, Wise, and Good, than to know many mediocre things. 

In [[Martial Arts]], it is far better master deeply a few things that actually work, than to practice and half-know many fancy techniques. 

In [[Integrated Delivery]], it is far better to master deeply a few basics, than to fail to operate a more complex system that is beyond your capacity. 

In [[Reading]], it is far better to read, reread, and truly comprehend the wisest and Most Worthy books from the wisest people, than to half-understand a wide array of mediocre writings. 

A very few things moves nearly all things. 

One moves a few, a few moves 3%, 3% moves 20%, and 20% moves 80%.
