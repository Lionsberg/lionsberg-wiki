# 13. Loving Embodiment, Not Form
Religious people often wander away from the Way in the pursuit of forms. 

_...but go and learn what this means: "I desire ([[Love]], Compassion, Mercy, Loyalty), and not sacrifice, and the [[Knowledge]] of [[God]] rather burnt offerings._ ~ Jewish Prophet

The Way is not a set of forms and techniques that can be copied and acted out. It is a Way of being in which the fullness of our being becomes a conduit for the Spirit of Love longing to flow through us and transform our Lives and our Reality.
