# 11. Spending Energy
[[Energy]], once carefully gathered and cultivated, must be carefully [[Stewardship|Stewarded]] and exchanged in a [[Wise Right]] Way that produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

Giving [[Energy]] to (something) requires spending, or sacrificing, our [[Energy]] to [[Attend]] to (it).

It is a sacrifice to spend [[Energy]] on (something), because by doing so we forgo the opportunity to spend that energy in that moment on (something else). 

What we "spend" our [[Energy]] on is a close relative that follows after the most important moral decision of what we [[Perceive]] and [[Attend]] to as a result of our [[Structure of Value]]. 

When we spend [[Energy]] to accomplish [[Work]] (anything that must be done to achieve a result), we are operating a part of the cosmic machine that is designed to produce [[The Goal]]. 

[[Work]] that produces [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] is [[Value]]. Everything else is [[Waste]]. 

[[Waste]] is not neutral. [[Waste]] hinders [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]] and therefore must be progressively driven out of the [[System]].
