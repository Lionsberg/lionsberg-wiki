# Lionsberg Co-Creator Handbook 
*(v.0.1 March 2024)*

## Part I: Welcome to Lionsberg

Welcome to Lionsberg. 

We are glad you are here. 

### I. How to Use This Book

As you embark on this epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]], each week you will reach new junctures that will require you to make important and transformational choices. 

Our individual and collective ability to [[Avoid Failure]] and [[Succeed]] on [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] will rest largely on the quality of the conscious decisions we make. 

Because [[The Means Are The Ends]], the [[New World]] we [[All]] inherit will be the product of what we [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] along the [[Way]]. So however you would like your life and your world to be, today is the day to begin partnering with those around you to embody it. We are all here for that shared mission. 

This book is meant to serve as a helpful [[Guide]] for your journey. It anticipates some of the [[Obstacles]], [[Challenges]] and [[Goals]] that lie ahead. 

As you read it and [[Progress]] on [[The Quest]], please help improve it for [[All]] those will follow in your footsteps. Everything about [[Lionsberg]] is a [[Work In Progress]], and is built to transform and get [[A Little Better Every Day]]. 

If you find something missing, co-create it. 

If you can improve something, transform it. 

If you see something that doesn't belong, remove it. 

We are All Co-Creators. 
### II. Your First Day 

Unless you were one of a very few lucky souls, it is likely that like us, you were born into and are emerging out of [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]]. 

Congratulations on awakening and beginning your [[Quest]] towards [[Liberty]], and welcome to life [[Beyond The Boundary]]. 

Out here in the [[Unknown]], life is quite different. It is extraordinary. It is beautiful. It is good. It is meaningful. It is dangerous. It is adventurous. 

Most of all, it is Real. But it is also [[New]] and different, and will take some getting used to. 

The biggest difference is that Out Here, you are [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]] and Free. Unlike life in [[Caves]], Out Here there are no [[Employee Consumer Slaves]].  

Out Here, you are the captain of the Vessel of your Existence, and your Experience will be exactly and precisely what you cause it to be in partnership with your fellow travelers. There is no "them" "out there" who can walk the [[Path]] for us, or [[Confront and Overcome]] the [[Challenges]] and [[Obstacles]] that lie in our [[Way]]. It is All up to Us. 

If something is broken, fix it. If something is lacking, fill it up. If something doesn't belong, remove it. If someone is hurting or stuck, help them. If you are hurting or stuck, ask for help. 

It is up to Us. All of it. [[We Are The Ones We Have Been Waiting For]].  

The moment you find your Self stuck, or wondering what the [[Next Steps]] are, remember not to look to Authority. That was the pattern of life in [[The Caves]], but it is deadly Out Here [[Beyond The Boundary]]. There are no Employees Out Here. 

Look within. Talk to your Group or Team. If you don't yet have a group or a team, your first task is to forge or join one. 

Every Group of Team should be engaged in the most meaningful Quest they can design and undertake for that season / quarter. If you are talking with your Group or Team and things aren't clear, go back to the drawing board, clarify your [[Quarterly Quests]] or choose a new one, and get moving. 

As you get into motion and being communicating to [[The Movement]] about what you are doing and Why, The Movement will be able to help you and your Team better [[Navigate]] and Steer. 

### III: A Few Orienting Facts

**Lionsberg is self-funding**: To ensure freedom, sovereignty, and autonomy, Lionsberg is self-funding and augmented by public support. There are no "investors". This is crucial to preserving our freedom, and with that freedom comes the responsibility to continue discovering creative ways of resourcing The Mission. 

**Lionsberg is self-governing**: The freedom of life [[Beyond The Boundary]] comes with the responsibility and authority for self-governance at every fractal level, from the individual, to the group, to the local, to the tribe, to the bioregion, and all the Way up to the broadest Whole. 

**Lionsberg is self-sustaining**: Every self-governing fractal level is also self-sustaining. Unlike the [[Old World]] of employee-consumer-slavery, Out Here we are all responsible for our own flourishing, and for the flourishing of [[All]] those around us.

**Lionsberg is self-replicating**: On the epic Quest towards Destiny, none of us can reach [[The Goal]] unless and until all of us reach [[The Goal]]. This means that the core function of every group is to flourish, self-replicate, and help new groups emerge, progress, and self-replicate. We monitor self-replication and growth via the [[Lionsberg Cycles of Growth]] and the [[Lionsberg Cycle Time]]. 

**Lionsberg is a True Myth**: Lionsberg is an incarnation of the archetypical story about We The People, who in a moment of [[Meta Crisis]], arose and united to confront and overcome the grand challenges, accomplish the global goals, journey towards [[The Promised Land]], while forging the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. It is a myth, but it is True, because we are causing it to be so. 

### IV: Life as a Sovereign, Autonomous Agent 

While the [[Power Structures]] of the [[Old World]] were exceptionally effective at keeping everyone divided, conquered, siloed, and optimally disempowered, the universe of [[Lionsberg]] is different. 

Every Citizen of Lionsberg eternally becomes ever more [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]] and [[Free]]. We sometimes call this [[Conscious Agency]]. 

The [[Pattern Language]] of the [[New World]] calls for individual and local self-governance, agency, and flourishing, in the context of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]]. We progress on our [[Quest]] towards that [[Destiny]] through our [[Practice]] of acting that out. 

This means that you have no "manager". No "boss". No external Authority but [[One]] and [[All]]. No accountability except to [[God]] and those who you voluntarily choose to collaborate with towards shared [[Goals]] and [[Values]]. 

Your life, your groups, your community, your bioregion, your world, and Lionsberg as a Whole are All yours to navigate towards [[The Goal]]. 

So figure out what [[One]] and [[All]] desire, that is uniquely yours to do, that no one else is doing, choose a [[Quest]], forge or join a Team, and get moving. 

And as you Move and Progress towards [[The Goal]], remember that because [[Out Here]] we are [[All]] responsible and empowered to steer the [[Vessel]] towards [[Destiny]], the most important thing you can ever do is help those around you become every more capable of skillfully navigating the [[Vessel]] towards [[The Goal]]. Navigation towards [[The Goal]] is the essence of [[Governance]], and the essence of the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

While every individual and group is Sovereign and Free, if we do not wisely collaborate to [[Navigate]] [[The Vessel]] towards [[The Goal]] in a Spirit of Unity, Harmony, and Coherence, we will tear it apart and find our Selves once again enslaved in the [[Old World]]. 

## Part II: Welcome to Life Beyond The Boundary 

### The Three Supreme Agreements 

Life, Community, and Collaboration [[Beyond The Boundary]] revolve around voluntary [[Agreements]] and [[Commitments]]. 

There are Three Supreme Agreements that ensure that The Game can be played indefinitely into the future, across all conceivable domains, in a [[Way]] that continuously improves, enhances, and enriches life for [[All]]. 

1. [[Love One]]  
2. [[Love One Another]]  
3. [[Love All]]   

The Three Supreme Agreements establish the [[Love]] of [[One]], [[One Another]], and [[All]] as the foundational principle and defining essence of all interaction in the Domain of Lionsberg. 

From these, the entire [[The Lionsberg System of Values|Lionsberg System of Values]] is derived. 

What all of these Values share in common is something like a [[Spirit]] or [[Essence]], that makes it intuitively clear what [[Patterns Of Action]] and Ways of Being lead to Success and Flourishing, and which lead to Failure and Death. Let's [[Help One Another]] flourish and succeed, and avoid failure and death. 

The Three Supreme Agreements are the backbone of the basic Covenant, or Field of Agreements, that protects all participants in the Domain of Lionsberg.
### Your First Quarter

Now that you are settling into life [[Beyond The Boundary]] as a [[Sovereign]] and [[Autonomous]] [[Conscious Agent]] co-operating in a Spirit of [[Love]] with your fellow travelers on our shared [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] of Greatest Worth...

 ...it is time to begin Being and Doing in Community. 
 
[[The Lionsberg Experience]] is designed to help guide you through this over the course of your first quarter.

In general, your first quarter will consist of getting your feet on the ground, discovering how to be and become, articulating [[Your Story]], deciding what to do, forging or joining a team, and lining up your first [[Quarterly Quest]]. 
### Discovering How to Be and Become 

After life in [[The Caves]], it is important to remember that the most important thing we are here on [[Earth]] to do is to *become* the fullness of Who we were each uniquely created to be. 

We cannot [[Progressively Realize]] the [[New World]] without [[Becoming]] the kinds of people for whom that is a Reality.  

So the first thing to *do*, is to relax and to *be*. Together. In Community. Helping One Another Heal, Transform, and Become who we are each uniquely created to Be. 
### Deciding What to Do 

In order for the Lionsberg System to function properly in service of [[One]] and [[All]], every individual and team must become [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]], continually choosing their own [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]] to advance. No one can tell you what to do. 

Unlike the companies of the [[Old World]], where "employees" were typically hired to fulfill specific roles, life as a [[Sovereign]] [[Conscious Agent]] requires that you are continually observing the world around you, reorienting, dialoging, negotiating, and engaging in the most [[Valuable]] and [[Meaningful Work]] that you and those around you are capable of doing in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

[[The Right Questions]] contains some helpful guiding questions as you decide [[What To Do]], such as: 

- What projects are on or near our shared [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]]?  
- What upcoming [[Milestones]] could I and my Teams help make progress towards? 
- What other Teams would we need to collaborate with to ensure that the next [[Milestones]] are reached within the [[Critically Effective Time Limit]]? 
- What should we be doing, that is not currently being done, that I am able to do and passionate about doing?  
- What project could be accomplished in the next 90 days that would produce the highest quality and quantity of service to One and All? 
- What valuable project is most likely to keep me and my team(s) in our [[Zone Of Optimum Development]]? 
- What valuable project would leverage my unique strengths the most? 
- What valuable project would be the most meaningful and rewarding to engage in? 

### Everything Is A Project   

As you discover [[What To Do]], remember that everything in the Great Game of Lionsberg, including our being and becoming, is a project. 

The [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Projects]] that we (and [[All Creation]]) are engaged in is united by the conceptual (and [[Ultimately Ineffable]]) [[Meta Project]]. 

Treating everything as a project is a core [[Discipline]] and [[Practice]] that enables us, over the course of quarters, years, and generations, to progressively develop our capacity to accomplish ever greater things in community, and to ensure that those [[Ever Greater Things]] can be systematically resourced across the ecosystem. 

It also ensures that as we and future generations continually choose new [[Quarterly Quests]] and engage with new teams in new places and times, everyone can get up to speed quickly. 

This is a cornerstone of the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]]. 
### Forging or Joining Teams

[[Everything Is A Project]], and all [[Quests Are Undertaken By Teams]]. 

Ideally, teams should be at least 3, and no more than 16 people. [[We Have Heard]] that 4 to 6 or 5 to 7 individuals is often optimal. As teams approach 10 to 12 people, they should begin cross-training, recruiting, and preparing to split into two co-operative teams. 

This is how the most excellent Teams become [[Self Replicating]]. 

Teamwork is crucial to ensure that no one is operating in isolation, and that the success or failure of any given Project / Quest does not rest on one person. 

This is also crucial to the self-sustenance, self-replication, and growth of [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The twin conventions that [[Everything Is A Project]], and that [[Quests Are Undertaken By Teams]] creates a continuous decentralized governance and resource allocation process whereby people have an idea, recruit other people to work on it with them, and [[Dialogue, Discern, and Decide]] in community how to allocate the time, energy, attention, and resources available to them towards the most Valuable Potentials. 

### Finding Out What Is Happening 

To find out [[What Is Happening]], you can reference the [[Lionsberg Dispatch]], the [[Above The Chaos]] channel, or the lists of [[Active Teams]] and [[Active Projects]], but a far [[Better]] way is to talk with other humans. 

Talking with other humans is [[Better]] than solely looking at lists, because it opens up [[Dialogue]], builds relationships, helps people get to know you, and folds your wisdom, insights, and questions into the collective dialogue. 

By asking around, and sharing with others [[Who You Are]], [[Your Story]], [[Your Purpose]], [[Your Calling]], [[Your Concerns]], [[Your Capabilities]], etc., the Community will be able to help match you up to other people, opportunities, needs, and ideas in ways that a list never could. 

The [[10 Year Grand Strategy]] cannot actually succeed unless We truly become a Community. 

### Progress and Throughput of The Goal

As a [[Conscious Agent]] with [[Responsibility and Authority]] to [[Consciously Choose]] your own [[Teams]] and [[Quests]], you will notice that you and your teams will be continually presented with an array of [[Opportunities]],  [[Threats]], and [[Temptations]]. 

One of the most important concepts of the [[Lionsberg System]] is the notion of [[Critical Path]] [[Progress]] towards the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

Always remember [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]], and focus [[Time, Energy, and Attention (TEA)]] on [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Critical Path]] towards [[The Goal]].  

Whatever you do, before you undertake a Project, ensure that it is not tying up [[Resources]] that could be allocated to [[Teams]] advancing the [[Critical Path]]. It might be that you have a brilliant idea that should definitely be done, not now, but rather in a quarter or three at the [[Wise Right Time]]. Always remember that we are walking in the [[Way]] of [[Kairos]], not merely [[Chronos]]. 

### How Lionsberg Collectively Decides What Is Most Important and Valuable to Do Next

Lionsberg does not make governance and resource allocation decisions centrally, but rather relies on the distributed intelligence of the Community. 

What Lionsberg as a Whole is working on at any given time is the sum total of all the [[Projects]] being done by the distributed array of [[Teams]] to advance along the [[Critical Path]]. 

This process co-operates similar to the way that bees and ants scout out the most [[Valuable]] opportunities and threats, dance and dialogue, and then allocate collective energy towards the Highest and Best available options surfaced in Community.

More concretely, this process occurs through the mechanism of Discernment and Consent around [[Proposals]].  

Individuals may make [[Proposals]] to the Groups / Teams they are engaged in, and Groups / Teams may make [[Proposals]] to the Whole. 

Once decisions are made, they are constantly tested against [[Reality]] to ensure that they continue to be correct, and to see whether they can be improved. The Whole is constantly shifting and morphing as a consequence of the daily, weekly, and quarterly micro-decisions being made by [[Autonomous]] Individuals and Teams. 

As we navigate through [[The Wilderness]] on our Quest towards [[The Promised Land]], we do not pretend that [[Reality]] will be easy or smooth to traverse. It requires constant [[Discernment]], [[Wisdom]], [[Governance]] and [[Navigation]].  

Lionsberg collectively as [[One Body]] is responsible for maintaining the uniting Vision, Principles, and Values, and Co-Creating and Continuously Improving [[The Conditions]] and [[The Commons]] within which the emergent process of venturing together into the [[Unknown]] and towards [[The Goal]] can manifest and succeed. 

It also continuously improves the shared Strategy and Plan via the [[System Wide Master Planning Process]] so that all individuals and [[Teams]] have a clear picture of the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The role of Lionsberg collectively is simply to serve and empower [[All]] those who have their feet on the [[Path]] towards [[The Goal]] as we learn together how to Embody and Enact the [[Pattern Language]] of the [[New World]] we are co-creating. 

### Cultural Norms and Expectations

Everyone on the [[Path]] is committed to co-operate in a Spirit of Love and do their best to help and not harm one another. 

In general the expectation is that we all do our best to learn [[The Rules]] of [[The Game]], and become the best players / practitioners / teammates / citizens / community members we are capable of becoming. 

As we look over the millennia towards the horizon of destiny, it is the Culture, Processes, Norms, and Values that persist, not the individuals, projects, or teams. 

Culture, the Way we do things around here as a human species, trumps everything. It became the [[Root Cause]] of the [[Meta Crisis]], and it is The Key to [[The Promised Land]]. 

## Part III: The Lionsberg Experience

Now that we have solved the basics of getting up and running, in [[Teams]], engaged in [[Meaningful Conversations and Quests]], that advance us collectively through the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]], it is time to discover how we [[Help One Another]] discover and achieve the fullness of our [[Potential]], at each fractal level of analysis. 

The Lionsberg Experience is not just about elevating and transforming our world; it is about elevating and transforming all aspects of our lives. 

[[Out Here]] [[Beyond The Boundary]], every aspect of the development and progression of your Self, your [[Families]], your [[Teams]], your [[Communities]], your [[Bioregions]], your [[Tribes]], your [[Nations]], and Lionsberg as a Whole are now under your [[Conscious Agency]], [[Responsibility]], and [[Authority]]. 

You are the Author of [[(Y)Our]] Future. [[You Are The First Agent]]. 

[[There Is No Them]] "out there". We are responsible, together, for every aspect of our existence, flourishing, and success, for our Selves, and for All. 

[[The Lionsberg Experience]] aims to continually meet every individual, team, and locality right where they are on the [[Path]], and help them stay in the [[Zone Of Optimum Development]] that empowers them to rise towards the fullness of their unique potential.

## Part IV: Integrating Our Quests and Progress 

### Stacking Up and Aligning Quests 

Individual and Local Quests are (ideally) stacked up and aligned through the various [[Levels of Analysis]] to produce [[Throughput]] of our shared [[Goals]] and [[Values]] via the [[Critical Path]] revealed by the [[System Wide Master Planning Process]].  

Our shared [[Goals]] and [[Values]] reveal and lead us through the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

### Minimum Standards of Interoperability 

In order for the [[Work]] done in Teams to be Integrated into the Whole, all Teams must honor the [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]].

## Part V: Monitoring Progress 

Progress is monitored against the [[Milestones]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]] via the [[System Wide Master Plan]] and [[Mission Control]]. 

## Part VI: Growing The Movement and Passing The Flame

### Your Most Important Role

Remember, We are [[One Body]]. None of us can realize [[The Goal]] unless and until we [[All]] Progress [[FROM the Old TO the New]].  

Your most important role is to [[Pass The Flame]] to those who awaken and are ready. 

Every individual may invite up to one individual a week to [[Join The Movement]], and may nominate additional individuals for consideration by others with available invitations. 

### Successful Integration 

We will know The Flame has been successfully passed when each new co-creator: 

1. Accepts [[The Invitation]] to [[Join The Movement]]  
2. Forges or Joins a Group / Team  
3. Initiates a [[Quarterly Quest]]  
4. Contributes - Time / Energy / Resources / Relationships 
5. Passes The Flame to the next Wise Right Individual
