# Co-Creating The New World  

# Part I: The Meta Crisis and the Quest Towards The Goal 

## I. The Story of The Builder, Part I

Once upon a time, there was a community not unlike our own nestled in a valley at the foot of a tall [[Sacred Mountain]]. 

There came a time in its history when the community was mired in conflict, confusion, chaos, and hopelessness. 

In a small corner of the community, there was a Builder named Nicholas. 

His greatest heart's desire was to design and build a beautiful [[City on a Hill]], that would lift people up out of the darkness and despair of life in [[The Valley]], and serve as a Fortress of [[Hope]] and [[Inspiration]] for generations to come. 

He spent decades thinking, praying, discerning, and designing the intricate details of a [[Community]] where people could [[Flourish in Harmony]] with the Creator, One Another, and All Creation. 

Many in the community of The Valley thought it was a preposterous idea. The more The Valley drifted towards [[Chaos]] and confusion, the more abstract and out of touch the Idea of a flourishing and vibrant [[City on a Hill]] became. They called him a madman and a dreamer, they rejected and slandered him, and the authorities of The Valley sought to tear down his resources and reputation.  

Despite the hardship, Nicholas knew that he would be betraying his soul and purpose if he did not work tirelessly to realize what the Creator had placed on his heart since his earliest memories. 

After many years of designing, the plans were laid, the [[Meta Crisis]] was on the horizon, and Nicholas climbed up to the heights of the [[Sacred Mountain]] to begin work on the Magnificent City he had been shown, for the benefit, inspiration, and protection of the community of The Valley. 

He knew that they would need an [[Ark]] to carry them through the [[Chaos]] that lay ahead. 

As he began work, the villagers began to come out to see what he was building. The children mocked him and threw stones. A little girl shouted derisively "That is not a Magnificent City! It's a terrible pile of rubble."

"Wait and see, little one," he replied. "Someday this Great City may come to help you more than you know."

Another villager came by and said "Where is the well? How will the Great City get water?"

"A wonderful question," the builder said. "Let us review the [[Plans and Specifications]] together and see. Perhaps you could help improve them." 

The next day the villager came back with the local well expert. They reviewed the plans and specifications, made some improvements, surveyed the territory, and fixed the location of the well. 

"Wonderful," the builder said. "Now we have a wise design for nourishing the Great City with Living Water."

The local pastor came by a few days later, and asked "Where will the church be in the Great City?"

"A wonderful question," the builder said. "Let us review the plans and specifications together and see, perhaps you could help improve them." They reviewed the plans, and agreed that [[The Corner of Faith and Hope]] right along [[The Town Square]] would be a perfect location. 

The pastor was delighted, and a week later he brought back some [[Volunteers]] to review the plans, and to ask the Builder if they could begin laying foundations for the Corner of Faith and Hope. They were truly eager to begin building the church. 

"That is a wonderful idea," the Builder replied. "It would definitely help progress to begin laying the foundations for the Corner of Faith and Hope. We will just need a surveyor to lay out the streets and the boundaries around Town Square." 

"My uncle is a surveyor," one of the young men replied. "I am sure he would be delighted to come lay out the Town Square and the Corner of Faith and Hope so we could begin."

That weekend, a large crowd was up on the hill, surveying the town, setting stakes, marking corners, and imagining how beautiful the view from the Church and the Great City would be. 

A respected older man in the community approached the Builder out of the crowd. "I have carefully looked through your plans and specifications, and I think your roads are abysmal. They will never work, and they will be a catastrophe for anyone who attempts to use them. I do not want anything to do with your ill-conceived City on a Hill."

With a disgusted and cynical look, he turned and began to make his way back down the [[Way]] towards [[The Valley]]. 

The Builder called out after him "Please Good Sir, are you willing to help me? I do not pretend to know how to create the best roads, but if you are willing to share your [[Wisdom]] I am willing to [[Listen]]. Would you please take a few moments to explain to me how the roads are inadequate, and what changes we might be able to make to bring them to within your [[Range of Tolerance]]?"

The elder paused, and then reluctantly agreed that he could take a few minutes to point out the inadequacies in more detail. 

The Builder knew he would need the [[Wisdom]] of [[The Elders]], with the exuberance of [[The Youth]], and the strength of [[The Adults]] in order to [[Avoid Failure]] and [[Succeed]], no matter how difficult it was to get everyone working together. It would take the collaboration of all generations to [[Co-Create]] something truly [[Ideal]]. 

One of the members working on the layout of the church was a local grocer. "Where are you planning to set up the local shops?" he asked. 

"That is a wonderful question," the Builder replied. "Let us review the plans and specifications together and see, perhaps you could help improve them." They explored the design for a large cobblestone Main Street coming off Town Square, with local shops to provision the families of [[The Great City]]. As they talked, the grocer and the Builder began excitedly drawing plans for the layout of the store, the discussing the [[Supply Chains]] that would provision it. 

The next day the Builder climbed the [[Way]] up to the [[Sacred Mountain]] as he did every day, studying and praying over the plans and [[Progress]], and asking God to reveal and direct their [[Next Steps]]. As he was praying, a childhood friend from The Valley who had grown up alongside the Builder approached him and startled him out of his prayers. "I have been praying on [[The Mountain]] this morning," the friend said abruptly. "I hoped I would find you here. I am deeply troubled by your dangerous plan to build this City." He also cared deeply about the town, but felt strongly that any plan for Hope needed to involve working to transform The Valley below from within. "Your creative ideas are dangerous. You are up here trying to build a City in the clouds, while we are down in the trenches of The Valley fighting the true battle. God did not tell me to build a City on a Hill, God told me we need to build boundaries and protections against the threats [[At Hand]]." 

The Builder put his hand on his friends back. His friend was angry and stiff. "I agree with you brother that we must build boundaries for The Valley below. The threats at hand are indeed Great. I am a Builder and I know well how to build boundaries. Perhaps God has laid a [[Diversity]] of plans on the hearts of those uniquely called to [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] them. Perhaps what God has shown you is Wise, Right, and Good and needs to happen, and what God has shown me is right and good too. I bear witness with the Wisdom of your plan and would be glad to [[Help]] you. Would you be willing to help me as well? Perhaps we could share teams and logistics as we work to fortify the Old and build the New together."

The friend fell silent and thought. He had not considered that both could happen simultaneously. 

As they were talking, the little girl and some of her friends ran up out of breath after climbing up the mountain. She was amazed to see all the [[Progress]]. "Wow! Your pile of rubble is really coming to life! What are you doing now?" she asked.  

"We are co-creating a Great [[City on a Hill]], that will serve as a light, a fortress, and an inspiration for The Valley for generations to come. Would you like to see the plans for the school and playground?" 

The little girl was intrigued, and began imagining and dreaming with the Builder about what kind of school and playground they might be able to co-create. As she talked and dreamed, the Builder wrote her ideas down in the plans and specifications, and modified [[The Design]] to reflect her creativity and insight. "That will be a great improvement to The Design," the Builder told her. "I can't believe I left out the swings. What a silly mistake. Thank you very much for helping me design and build this City on a Hill."

After the little girl and her friends scampered away, the Builder turned back to his childhood friend, who was glaring at him with a hard look on his face. "I just don't think we can trust you. Remember in our youth when you had the bright of idea of building a cart to help us carry our supplies? I still remember the lashing my father gave me after the wheels fell right off and all our hard earned supplies tumbled down into the river. What makes you think that you can build an entire City on a Hill? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole damn thing tumbled down the mountain after the first little storm. Just think of how disappointed everyone will be in you then. When that happens, I'll tell them I warned them, and say "I was right about him all along."

The Builder grew thoughtful. "You are absolutely right. I am completely unqualified. I have never built a City on a Hill. No one has. I can only do my best, and hope that the other qualified members of the community will help. I never said I could build a City on my own. Fortunately, the well expert has fixed the well, the road expert has fixed the roads, the grocer has fixed the shops, and the little girl has fixed the playground. Because of all their help, I am confident that the City is growing sound and strong."

Day after day, week after week, more and more people streamed up the Sacred Mountain, studied the plans and specifications, and began to dream and design and build together around the parts of The City they each cared about and valued the most.

While there were plentiful trials, tribulations, and conflicts along the Way, the City on a Hill offered the [[Citizens]] of The Valley an inspiration and Hope that had been missing for generations. 

In partnership with God and One Another, they were co-creating a truly Magnificent City. It was rising up before their eyes, and getting [[A Little Better Every Day]] as they worked together in [[Harmony]] to cause it to be so.

## II. The Story of The Caves, Part I

### Wisdom Cries Out 

From Proverbs: 

_[[Wisdom]] cries out in the streets._   

_She lifts up her voice in the public square._   

_At the head of the noisy streets she calls out._  

_At the entrance of the city gates she declares her sayings:_    

_How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking? And how long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, and fools hate [[Knowledge]]._    

_Turn to my rebuke, behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you; I will make my words known to you._  

_Make your ear attentive to [[Wisdom]]. Incline your heart to [[Understanding]]._    

_For if you cry out for [[Insight]], and raise your voice for [[Understanding]];_  

_If you seek me as silver and search for me as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the [[One]], and discover the [[Knowledge]] of [[God]]._    

_For the [[One]] gives [[Wisdom]]. From His mouth come [[Knowledge]] and [[Understanding]]._  

_He stores up sound [[Wisdom]] for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in [[Integrity]], guarding the paths of [[Justice]]…_  

_Then you will [[Discern]] [[Righteousness]], [[Justice]], and [[Integrity]], and every [[Good]] [[Path]]._  

_For [[Wisdom]] will enter your heart, and [[Knowledge]] will be delightful to your soul; [[Discretion]] will watch over you, [[Understanding]] will guard you, to rescue you from the way of evil._  

_Yet because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; and you neglected all my advice and did not heed my rebuke;_  

_I will also laugh when your dread comes like a storm, and your disaster like a whirlwind._  

_For the faithlessness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them._  

_But whoever listens to me will live securely, and be at ease from the dread of evil._  

### The Right Questions 

If we stop. If we [[Pray]]. If we [[Meditate]]. If we [[Listen]] deeply enough. We can hear the voice of [[Love]] calling us up and away from suffering and bondage, and into the fullness of [[Life]], [[Purpose]], and [[Destiny]].  

_We were created and destined for so much more than this._  
 
There has never been a more important moment in history to stop and ask. To stop and listen. To open our ears to what the Spirit is saying. To ask ourselves individually and collectively the great questions of life:  
 
“Who am I?”  
 
“Who am I becoming?”  
 
“Who or what is creating and sustaining my [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]]?”  
 
“Who or what is creating and sustaining the universe?”  
 
“Is the [[Source and Sustainer]] at least as [[Conscious]] as I am”?  

“Does the [[Source and Sustainer]] speak?”  
 
“What is the [[Source and Sustainer]] saying?”   
 
“To whom is the [[One]] speaking?”  
 
“What is the meaning, purpose, and destiny of [[Life]]?”  
 
“What is the meaning, purpose, and destiny of _my_ life?”  
 
“Who are we?”  

“Where are we?”   

“Why are we here?”  

“How did we get here?”  
 
“What the hell is going on around here?”  

“Why is it so dark in here?”  
 
“How did it come to this?”  
 
“Why is there all this sickness, disease, corruption, and suffering?”  

"Why is there all this Love, Joy, Goodness, and Wonder?"  

“What is my relationship to suffering and those who suffer?”  
 
“What is my relationship to those who consciously cause suffering?”  

“What is my relationship to structures of injustice?”  
 
“What is the meaning of this?”  
 
The questions and the answers are eternal and universal.  
 
They hold the keys to our survival and [[Success]].  
 
They have been spoken by prophets, sages, and grandparents throughout the millennia.  

They can be summarized in a single word, because they reflect aspects of an [[Ultimate Reality]] that is a fundamental [[Unity]].  


 
Yet that single word is only a sound. It is only a tool. It sounds different in every language. Yet all the words point to [[One]] so much deeper and so much more profound that no words could ever fully articulate It.  

Follow the [[Right Questions]], and you will always arrive back to the [[One]].  













### Unmoored in the Seas of Chaos 

You are asleep.

Imprisoned within a [[Vessel]] that has come unmoored in the midst of the storms, and is being violently driven and tossed by the waves in the roiling seas of [[Chaos]]. 
 
The Spirit that confronts and overcomes the darkest terrors and forges [[New Order]] out of their ashes is on the move. 
 
It is calling you. It is whispering to you. It is breathing into your lungs. It is beating into your heart. It is inviting you. 

Deep is crying out to Deep...  

The Depths of All that Is, crying out to Depths of All that Is You... 

_"Wake up!"_
 
_"Awaken! Arise! Remember who are you are!"_

You begin to stir, becoming vaguely aware of the vice-like grip of the induced coma on your [[Consciousness]].

_"Wake up! It is not real. You have been dreaming. You have been asleep for a very long time..."_  

_"Awaken and grab the helm!"_  

_"Arise, and remember who you are!"
  
_"Take up your rightful [[Authority]], and [[Navigate]] towards [[Life]] and [[Light]]!" 

The whisper is shattering. It roars like thunder. It hurts. 

_"You are in great danger. We must go! Quickly now!"_

One eye half opens, then closes. There is little difference. It is dark. It is wet. It is cold. It is stagnant. It smells like death. 

You start to drift back into the coma. 

_"Wake up! It is time. Up now! Here we go!"_ 

The eyes of your [[Consciousness]] blink without opening. 

_"Open your eyes. Look. Attend. Courageously face down that which you least want to look at!''_

_"Brave the storms you are most terrified to venture out into!"_

_"Grab the helm and transform the [[Vessel of Society]] into an [[Ark]] that can carry [[All]] safely onward towards their [[Destiny]]."_

The whispering Voice feels like it is shattering your ear drums. As you try to move your arm, it is heavy, and doesn't move. You try to open your eye again, but the lid does not budge. 

You long to cover your ears and shut it all out, but the Voice is within, and your limbs are frozen. 

What is this madness? Is it a dream? 

The Voice grows firm. 

_"Now."_

The Spoken Word sounds like the _roar of many waters_, echoing through the depths of the Earth. 

It finally startles you awake into a nightmare. 

_"I have been trying to awaken you for a very long time. Your life is in danger. You are going to have to trust Me. We must move quickly, and I will explain things along the [[Way]]._

_"Who are you?"_ you ask...

_"I Am," the Voice thunders in reply._

_"Could you please speak more softly? Your voice is hurting my ears."_

_"I am whispering as softly as I can. Your ears will soon attune to My Voice. It has been a long time since they have heard."_

As the energy of the Voice permeates your [[Consciousness]], your [[Embodiment]] slowly comes back towards life. 

*"Open your eyes."

With tremendous effort, first one eyelid opens, then the other. 

As your eyes strain to adjust to the darkness and you try to move, the first subtle movement brings the sound of chains to your ears. Your body feels sore, weak, and cold, and you soon realize you are helpless. 

It is quiet, except for an eerie mechanical din, and a strange sort of cacophonous chanting. 

The ground feels like it is rolling beneath you. 

*"Quickly now, awaken and arise. It is time to go."*

_"But how will I stand?"_

_"Do not fear. I will carry you."_

At once, you are swept up into the air and your chains rip free of the wall.

_"Quickly now, the Authorities will be along soon, and it is not yet time to wake the others. We have much work to do, and much to prepare for."_

### The Caves

Covered in the ethereal cloak of the Spirit, you are swept along through the cool damp air, a tangible contrast to the enveloping warmth embracing you. 

An occasional fire casts flickers of light onto the walls, and you begin to make out figures. 

Millions of them. Billions of them. 

Chained to the walls of their caves. 

_"Where are you taking me?"_

_"Beyond."_

_"Beyond what?"_

_"Beyond the [[Boundary]]."_

_"What [[Boundary]]?"_

_"My Voice will wake the others if I speak, and what I am about to show you is beyond your ability to conceive of it. Be quiet and try to [[Perceive]], and we will discuss it when we are out safely Beyond."_

The nightmare you witness as your soar through the cavernous darkness stands in stark contrast to the grey dreams that are your only recent memories. 

Pale bodies, billions of them, chained in the darkness. Shallowly breathing. Scarcely alive. 

As your eyes adjust to seeing for the first time, you begin to [[Perceive]] the terrain. 

It becomes apparent that you are making your way through some kind of vast network of caves. Some are so enormous that the sea of bodies they hold fades out beyond view, and others are tiny, containing a single human in tormented isolation. 

Strange beings stand guard at the mouth of each cave. As you look more closely at the beings, you can see that although they wear clothes, they are decaying, as if their very essence is rotting from within. They speak incessantly, uttering the same words that strangely seem to be flowing in response from the mouth of the cave. 

Are the caves speaking? 

As your ears continue to discover how to hear, they gradually attune to the cacophony, each sound becoming magnified - a relentless assault on senses newly awakened to the din of chaos and despair.

Descending through a narrow pass, you come close enough to the mouth of a cave to get a better glimpse of the captives within. 

They are asleep, but they are speaking! The words coming from the mouths of the caves are the words coming from the mouths of their inhabitants in unison, and the words coming from the mouths of the captives are the mindless repetition of the incessant chatter of the Keepers of that cave. 

Involuntarily, you suddenly find yourself vomiting out pale grey liquids, that cascade down onto the pale grey bodies uttering the pale grey words into the pale grey expanse of the caves.

The Spirit grips you tighter and you feel... something that you have no words for. 

_"Am I... one of those?"_ you ask the Spirit with horror...

_"No."_ The Spirit whispers firmly. _"You were one of those, but now you are awake. That is why it was so hard to wake you. It is nearly impossible to hear My Voice while you are mindlessly repeating the empty words of the Keeper of your [[Cave]]."_

Confronted with a terror so profound, a realization so appalling, and a cacophony so deafening, your body rejects the overwhelming horror with another wave of nausea and vomiting, before darkness claims you, and you succumb once again to unconsciousness.

_To Be Continued..._








## III. The Meta Crisis 

### Awakening to the Dreadful Realization 

As humanity edged its way into the [[New Millennium]], one by one individuals began awakening to the horror of their slumbering and cacophonous captivity within [[The Caves]], with each revelation spreading like a spark of wildfire. 

From the first few to hundreds, then thousands, the awakened souls sought out and began to find [[One Another]], sharing [[Information]] and collaboratively piecing together the reality of the shared condition they were emerging from and into. 

Alarmingly, with each piece of [[Information]] shared and every truth uncovered, the reality of their plight deepened, revealing a situation far more dire than any had imagined. 

It was bad enough that billions were held captive and asleep in [[The Caves]]. 

Yet, an even more alarming realization dawned: the entire [[Human System]] and [[Living System]] had suffered such profound abuse and exploitation by the Keepers of The Caves that a systemic collapse was imminent. 

The proverbial building was not just on fire—it was ablaze, with the vast majority still obliviously slumbering within its walls.

### The Array of Crises 

Gradually, from myriad perspectives, they pieced together the grim reality. With each and every unique observation of an apparently unrelated systematic issue, the evidence of a deep [[Meta Crisis]] grew more and more irrefutable. 

An awakened scientist revealed that even the rainwater in Earth's most remote areas was tainted with toxic chemicals.

An awakened politician warned that the Keepers of the Caves were steering their captives toward a global war. 

An awakened pastor informed the others that spiritual leaders were being silenced, beaten, ostracized, and even killed if they did not parrot the lines of the [[Power Structures]]. 

An awakened economist informed the others that the financial, debt, and monetary systems had come unmoored from [[Reality]], and were floating away towards failure and collapse. 

An awakened teacher revealed the school curriculums' deep corruption, indoctrinating children into failure, division, dysfunction, despair, and false ideologies. 

An awakened worker highlighted the widening opportunity gap between the many and the few reaching a critical breaking point. 

An awakened farmer exposed how [[The Giants]] were intentionally devastating bioregional food systems and production capacity. 

An awakened lawyer informed the others that the courts had become so corrupted that they only offered respite to those wealthy enough to be able to manipulate them. 

An awakened botanist reported plant ecosystems dying off due to the scarcity of insects and pollinators.

An awakened entomologist informed the others that two thirds of many insect populations had collapsed in an insect apocalypse as a result of habitat loss, pesticides, agricultural chemicals, pollution, and disease. 

An awakened zoologist informed the others that two thirds of many animal populations had collapsed for similar reasons. 

A reproductive specialist informed the others that the sperm counts of human males had also collapsed by nearly 2/3rds over recent decades. 

An awakened doctor informed the others that the food and drink being provided to the [[Employee Consumer Slaves]] in [[The Caves]] was full of toxic chemicals that inhibited key biological functions and triggered [[Chronic Inflammation]], leading to skyrocketing [[Chronic Disease]]. 

An awakened microbiologist informed the others that much of the collapse in health and life in insects, plants, animals, and humans was actually the result of the destruction of the [[Microbiome]]. 

An awakened supply chain manager outlined how global supply chains had become critically fragile, teetering on the brink of collapse from minor disruptions.

An awakened banker illuminated the historic rates of debt after thousands of years without a [[Jubilee]], and the essential bankruptcy of various tribes and nations. 

An awakened psychologist informed the others of skyrocketing rates of mental health issues, addiction, anxiety, depression, and suicide. 

An awakened aid worker informed the others of skyrocketing rates of mass migration, and the attendant risks of disease, conflict, and war. 

An awakened social scientist informed the others of the degree to which the schools, universities, governments, and other civic institutions had fallen prey to ideological capture. 

An awakened voter informed the others of the thousands of dollars being spent by the [[Invisible Power Structures]] on every vote, the predatory presence of multiple lobbyists for every official, the extent of [[Regulatory Capture]], and the unholy alliances between religious denominations and political parties. 

An awakened student informed the others of the youth of the nations being coerced into student debt spirals and lifelong debt slavery in return for failed educations. 

An awakened juror informed the others about the extraordinary rates of institutionalization and incarceration in the empires of the Earth, and profound perversions of Justice. 

An awakened senior informed the others about the degree of elder abuse and neglect, and the tremendous suffering, loneliness, and alienation of the older generations. 

An awakened technologist sounded the alarms about the accelerating efforts to deploy artificial intelligence and robotics in war, and the numerous existential threats and opportunities posed by AI. 

And it was evident to All that after generations imprisoned in [[The Caves]], any semblance of uniting [[Vision]] and [[Values]] had been destroyed. Society was divided against itself and the Earth, and rapidly failing. 

These are but a small sampling of the stories that specialists in a diverse array of [[Domains]] told one another. The varied reports from different perspectives wove together a tapestry of crises, each thread revealing more and more of the underlying [[Meta Crisis]].  

In the end, the experience of one confirmed another, and statistically the probability that everything was ok and the existing Order would survive rapidly approached zero. 
### The Meta Crisis 

Eventually, they came to refer to the crisis of crises they were collectively facing as the [[Meta Crisis]]. Capturing the entire panoply of disaster and dysfunction in a single term gave the awakening citizens a way of discussing the issues with a shared language. Soon, an entire shared lexicon began to emerge, the words progressively illuminating complexities that they previously lacked the language to articulate. 

The [[Meta Crisis]] was an unprecedented [[Existential Threat]] that nearly disqualified humanity from ongoing existence aboard Earth. It was a universal challenge that threatened the very fabric of [[Society]], and the [[Living System]] that contained it. 

Arising from the [[Way of Being]] of the Human Species aboard Planet Earth, they came to understand that the [[Meta Crisis]] demanded a profound and historic [[Citizen Led Response]]. Before it was too late. 

By the early 2020s, [[The Story]] escalated to a climactic tension, teetering on the edge of absurd comedy and despair, with the fate of our heroes—and the human species aboard Earth itself—shrouded in uncertainty. 

## IV. The Story of Stories 

### Time To Awaken, Arise, and Move

Finding them Selves on the brink of catastrophic failure, mired in [[Chaos]] and [[Division]], and hurtling towards [[Collapse]] and [[World War]],  something strange happened to humanity. 

It was as if the overwhelming intensity of the Cold and Darkness of The Caves, contrasted with the searing heat of the wildfire slowly consuming Society, inadvertently conspired to awaken the Citizens as the [[Vessel of Society]] accelerated towards [[The Chasm]]. 

The awakening was exponential, and spread far more rapidly than anyone would have imagined. It was As If something Deeper was on the move, shaking humanity one by one out of their near-fatal slumber. 

Awakening in the Darkness, feeling the searing Cold and the chilling heat, hearing the chains, and catching flickering glimpses of [[The Chasm]], it was obvious to each as they awakened that it was time to arise, liberate One Another, and *Move, Together, NOW. 

They may not have known yet Where [[They Were Going]] or [[Why]], but it was exceedingly obvious that [[They Could Not Stay Here]]. 

It was also self-evident that What Had Got Them To Where They Were, Would Not Carry Them Forward To Where They Wanted To Go. 

The conditions were perfectly ripe for a quantum phase shift in the patterns of human existence aboard [[Worksite Earth]]. 

### Reconstructing The Story 

The Guides among them were wise enough to understand that without a uniting [[Vision]], they would all perish in [[The Wilderness]] that separated [[The Old]] from [[The New]]. 

They were also wise enough to understand that [[Consciousness]] fundamentally lays its Self out in a [[Narrative Framework]], such that the [[Vision]] had to be contextualized within an overarching and uniting [[Story]].  

The Project of reconstructing [[The Story]] of humanity aboard [[Vessel Earth]] was one of the most profound early challenges of [[The Quest]]. 

After generations enslaved in [[The Caves]], humanity had entirely lost the plot. It had forgotten Who It Was. It had forgotten Where It Was. It had forgotten How It Had Got Here. It had forgotten Where It Was Going. It had forgotten Why. It had lost the Sacred Vision. It had lost The Plot. 

The vast majority of them had spent their entire lives asleep in [[The Caves]], mindlessly repeating, day after day, the words of the Keepers of whatever Cave they had been born into. 

The words of [[Keepers of The Caves]] had been progressively weaponized over the generations, growing ever more insidious and neurotoxic, warping the [[Neural Architecture]] of the captives with one primary goal: 

*To keep them asleep, divided, and conquered.* 

Above all, the warping of the [[Neural Architecture]] was *consciously designed* to prevent humanity from being able to [[Know]] the [[Truth]] that would inevitably set them free. 

Fortunately, [[The Spirit]] was on the move, revealing [[Truth]], healing [[Trauma]] and shattering [[The Chains]]. 

With each subtle realization and death of a falsehood, each awakening being was being healed and transformed from within. 

### The New Story 

Understanding the the [[Old Stories]] repeated in [[The Caves]] had become corrupted, divisive, and incompatible with [[Where They Were Going]] and [[Why]], the early awakeners began co-creating a [[New Story]]. 

They understood that the [[Meta Story]] they would need to reconstruct a shared [[Backward Looking Story]] that contextualized Who They Were, Where They Were, and How They Got There. 

Rediscovering Who and Where They Were, they also understood that the [[Meta Story]] would need to include a shared [[Forward Looking Story]] that contextualized Who They Were Becoming, Where They Were Going, With Who, How, and Why. 
### The Story of Stories 

[[The Spirit]] helped them understand that [[The Story]] would need to be both a [[Unity]] and a [[Diversity]]. And in fact that the closer The Story came to Absolute Unity at the Highest Level of Abstraction, the vaster an array of diversity could flourish within it. 

They began to refer to the [[Meta Story]] as a [[Story of Stories]]. 

It would be co-created and [[Emerge]] as each individual, family, group, tribe, and nation awakened, arose, rearticulated their own [[Individual And Local Story]], and wove their unique threads into [[The Story]] that was progressively reorienting and reuniting them [[All]]. 

Day by day, as the [[Individual And Local]] threads of [[The Story]] were woven into [[The Tapestry]], a clearer and clearer [[Image]] began to [[Emerge]]. 

The clearer the [[Image]] became, the more their [[Imagination]] opened, and the more [[Wisdom]], [[Courage]], and [[Strength]] they gained. 

After generations and generations of Darkness, Isolation, and Conflict, they were discovering that they were no longer alone. 

As they reconstructed [[The Story]], everyone was consciously aware that what they were constructing was in essence a Myth. For a soon as they articulated a Word and began to Concretize an aspect of The Story, it fell at least slightly short of the ineffable and Absolute Perfection the Spirit was revealing to them. 

However at the same time they understood, that the New Words they were articulating were only an [[Icon]] pointing towards something ineffably Deep, they also knew that the Myth they were co-creating was far more [[True]] than the stories they used to believe. In fact, they came to understand that it was the Truest thing they collectively knew. 

The Story, composed of the Individual and Local Stories of the billions who were awakening, and unified by [[One]] and [[All]], empowered children and adults around the world to once again Dream. 

As each awakening individual and locality came to the point of articulating their own Forward Looking Story, they were, for the first time, truly free and responsible to try to reimagine the way their lives and their world Should Be. They way they would like it to be. The playful energy of a return towards childlike Faith and Imagination swept across [[The Movement]] as individuals began sharing and deeply listening to One Another's hopes, dreams, and aspirations. One beautiful imagination fueled the next, ideas began remixing and recomposing themselves, spiraling upward towards Unity, Harmony, Coherence and Perfection, and soon, [[The Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] was Real in the Minds of All those Awakening. 

For the first time in history, they realized that they All wanted the same thing, and that together, it was possible. All Creation was longing and crying out together for the revelation of How Things Should, and now Could, Be. 

### The One Thing

The Vision of [[Heaven On Earth]], and the billions of people dreaming it together, was as vast and diverse as the world. 

They were delighted to discover that [[The Vision]] of [[Heaven]] looked dramatically different for the Achuar tribes of the Amazon, than it did for the Masai tribes of Kenya, than it did for the tribes of the Levant, than it did for the farmers in the plains of Turtle Island, than it did for the grandmothers of the North and the grandchildren of the South. 

Yet the [[Deepest]] level, it was clearly [[One]] logical, coherent, harmonious [[Whole]]. 

Time and time again, the question arose: What is the [[One Thing]] that united the diverse many? What was the [[Essence]], or [[Central Animating Spirit]], that [[All]] the diverse expressions of [[Heaven On Earth]] shared in common? 

They [[All]] knew that it was something beyond simple human will or desire. Some thought at first that it was an expression of reunification with [[Nature]]. Yet Nature was constantly transforming, ever changing, and continually threatening and testing the Order they were working together to forge. 

As they continued to look [[Deeper]], they Ultimately rediscovered the [[One]] that united [[All]] of its expressions. The eternal and unchanging. The unmoved mover. The uncaused cause. The Absolute. The generative [[Source and Sustainer]]. The Ultimate Unity giving rise to inexhaustible Creative Diversity. 

The [[One]]. The Supreme Author of [[The Story]] writing its Self through them. 

## V. The Ten Realizations

As [[The Image]] of [[The Story]] became progressively clearer in everyone's Minds, a series of Profound Realizations began to dawn on them. 

Among the hundreds of epiphanies, a small handful began to rise to the top as the [[Deepest]] and [[Most Essential]].  
### Epiphany One: In The Beginning, One

Despite the vast diversity of origin stories among the tribes and nations, the awakened were delighted to discover that nearly all of their stories started with a humble recognition of the Divine Beginning. 

As they wove the threads of the [[New Story]], they came to understand that this was not an elementary religious proposition. It was a statement of humility, an acknowledgement that beyond "our tribe" is humanity, beyond humanity is Earth, beyond Earth is Universe, and beyond Universe is the Ineffable Mystery that is creating, sustaining, permeating, and breathing life and breath into All things. 

The [[Ultimate Reality]] guiding the subsequent transformations of [[Reality]] across Space and Time. 

That which in English we point towards with [[Word Tools]] such as [[God]], [[Creator]], [[Ultimate Reality]].  

The beginning of [[The Story]] was different different across the diversity of tribes, and nations, yet [[All]] pointed back to [[One]]. 

The beginning of [[The Story]] sounded [[Something Like]]: 

In the beginning... 

_...there was nothing but One. All things had not come into being, and no thing existed except that which was possible in the Mind of the One._ 

In the beginning...

_…[[God]] created the heavens and the earth..._
 
In the beginning…

_…the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder._
 
In the beginning…

_…the earth was a formless and desolate void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the [[Spirit]] of [[God]] was hovering over the waters…_
 
In the beginning... 

_…the world was endless space in which existed only the [[Creator]]... The world had no time, no shape, and no life, except in the [[Mind]] of the [[Creator]]…_
 
In the beginning… 

_…something formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; silent and amorphous, it stood alone and unchanging, ever present and in motion. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I call it [[Tao]]. For lack of a better word I call it [[Supreme]]…_
   
In the beginning…

...*transcendent of every Story, Theology, Philosophy, and Logic is One Absolute, Primordial, First, Deepest, Ultimate Fact, whose Supreme Nature is a Mystery.* 

Before and beyond every name; before and beyond every attempt to grasp and comprehend; before and beyond every attempt to institutionalize; before and beyond every temple, idol and representation…
 
…from the [[One]], [[All]] things come into Being, and nothing comes into Being except through the [[One]]. 

*I Am.* 

They realized to their great delight that beyond religion, tribe, and nation, [[In The Beginning]], [[The Story]] was [[One]]. 

The rediscovery of the [[Knowledge of God]] beyond religion paved the Way towards the [[New Covenant]]. 

### Epiphany Two: One Interexistence 

The second great epiphany from [[The Story]] was that [[All]] things arising from the [[One]] were ultimately interconnected and interexistent. 

While the Song of Creation was subtly different in every tribe, those awakening could recognize that the variations were all harmonies in [[One]] [[Divine Symphony]]. 

In each Song of Creation, from [[One]] the [[Creative Field]] emerges into view, the primordial fabric of unstructured [[Potential]] from which, upon which, and through which [[All]] things arise. 

Every transcending and hovering over the [[Chaos]] of unstructured [[Potential]] was something like the [[Central Animating Spirit]]. 

And in-forming the animation of [[Potential]] into [[Form]] was something like the [[Logos]], or articulated Word and Logic of [[God]]. 

They came to understand that Creation was neither an random accident or a past event, but an ongoing Co-Creative [[Process]]. 

As if commanded by a Word, the [[Anti-Entropic]] Force is set into motion, the formless begins to coalesce into [[Form]], [[Chaos]] begins to ascend into [[Order]], and the elementary particles of the universe begin to assemble themselves.

Great processes of clustering, merging, synthesis, and fusion are unleashed. 

The [[Creative Field]] is moved into its subtlest forms, the subtle forms periodically gravitating into subatomic particles, subatomic particles uniting into nuclei, nuclei into atoms, atoms unite into stars, stars unite into galaxies, galaxies unite into clusters, galactic clusters uniting into galactic superclusters, and the galactic superclusters remaining interexistent aspects of One Body of Co-Creation. 

Over epochs and across the infinite field, One universal flower was unfurling its Self in obedience to its [[Metaphysical DNA]], each of its constituents alternately gravitating into Form, radiating back into Potential, and continuously spiraling up towards Higher Form. 

Perfectly ordered and consistent in Pure Principle and Design, from the highest-level concept to the lowest level detail, One Intelligible and Intelligent Cosmos was co-evolving in pursuit of the [[Logos]] and [[The Goal]] of the [[One]]. 

Among the billions of galaxies was one whose humans named it Milky Way; among whose billions of stars was one whose humans named it Sun; among whose many orbiting objects was one whose humans named it [[Earth]]. 

Among the trillions of planets manifest throughout the [[Creative Field]], the conditions on [[Earth]] were perfect for [[Life]]. 

Graduating from the endarkened understanding of previous centuries in [[The Caves]], awakening humanity came to deeply and progressively Realize that Earth, and all its inhabitants, were interexistent constituents of One Interexisting [[Living System]]. 

The [[Logos]] and the [[Conditions]] of [[Earth]] had conspired with Spirit to breathe forth a vast diversity of [[Life]].  

Among the [[Diversity]] emerged a unique being unlike any other, and yet one with them. 

Human Beings. Conscious cultivators, guardians, stewards, and [[Co-Creators]] of their experience aboard Earth. 

Endowed with creative [[Consciousness]], they shared with the [[One]] the Image and Power to consciously create and destroy by aggregating and channeling [[Energy]] towards consciously chosen goals and objectives, in response to consciously perceived issues, challenges, needs, threats, fears, and desires. 

For the first time, all those who were awakening to the [[New Story]] came to understand their Ultimate Interexistence as incarnate local aspects of One [[Living System]] that contained, sustained, and ultimately United them [[All]]. 

From this epiphany of interexistence, awakening humanity began to reconceptualize its unique role and [[Way of Being]] aboard [[Vessel Earth]], understanding that what each human being did or did not do unto any aspect of the Living System, it did or did not do unto its [[Self]], [[One]], and [[All]]. 

### Epiphany Three: Billions of Backward and Forward Looking Stories 

As humanity reconstructed [[The Story]], rediscovered their [[One]] Divine Beginning, and Progressively Realized their Ultimate Interexistence, the vast Diversity of their billions of unique stories were illuminated in greater detail than ever before. 

Far from suppressing their [[Diversity]], the dawning realization of their Ultimate Unity created the fundamental [[Conditions]] within which each [[Individual]] and [[Locality]] could freely express their unique [[Story]] without fear, for the first time. 

Whereas [[The Illusion of Separation]], the environment of [[Fear]], and the [[Us vs. Them]] mentalities fostered by the Keepers of [[The Caves]] had suppressed Diversity of expression, the Epiphany of Intereexistence and the co-creation of a [[New Story]] inherently contained within itself the invitation for every individual and locality to freely and truly express their unique individual and local [[Story]]. 

As more and more individuals, families and tribes awakened and began articulating their Stories, and as those stories began to be deeply listened to for the first time, humanity was shocked to realize that beyond the whitewashed histories and propaganda they had been force-fed in [[The Caves]], billions of unique stories and perspectives longed to be told. 

With a [[New Story]] big enough to embrace them [[All]], the vast diversity was finally free to truly articulate Who They Were, and their unique backwards and forward looking Stories. 

### Epiphany Four: One Uniting Story 

As the vast diversity of individual and local stories poured forth from [[All]] those awakening, they were continually reminded that without a [[New Story]] big enough to reunite them [[All]], the emerging Movement would tear itself asunder. 

As they worked to find out what was Common among their Stories, they discovered that the Deepest and Highest elements of their stories were shared, and that the Deeper and Higher the element was, the more Universally and Eternally it applied. 

They progressively realized that they were interexisting within One Living System that co-operated according to a set of Universal and Eternal Principles and Patterns. 

The Highest and Deepest Principles, Patterns, and Values showed up over and over again throughout the diverse array of [[Special Case]] individual and local instances. 

They discovered that the Personalities reflected in their stories arrayed themselves around a diverse-yet-finite set of [[Archetypes]]. The [[Archetypes]] were like [[Ideals]] that defined [[The Essence]] of a [[Category]]. 

They discovered that the Personalities in their stories were motivated by a set of [[Goals]] and [[Values]] that were shared at the Highest and Deepest levels. 

And they discovered that the Experiences reflected in their stories arrayed themselves around a set of [[Principles]] and [[Patterns]] that revealed the Nature of Society and the Living System. 

The more they articulated and listened to their Stories, the more they came to understand [[The Story]] of the interexistence of humanity and All Creation aboard [[Vessel Earth]]. 

They discovered that Experiences in their stories could be grouped into [[Categories]], that [[The Essence]] of what the stories in a category shared was something like an [[Archetype]] or [[Ideal]], and that the total set of [[Principles]], [[Values]], [[Patterns]], [[Archetypes]], and [[Ideals]] seemed to be interexisting in [[One]] Coherent and Intelligible [[Narrative Universe]]. 

The Deeper they came to understand [[The Story]], the more they came to understand that they were not alone. For generations, they had felt isolated. They had been told it was [[Us vs. Them]]. They had assumed that they were the only ones who were suffering in these ways. They had assumed they were the only ones who harbored these deep fears and desires. They had assumed they were the only ones who longed for a [[Better World]]. 

However as they shared, and as they listened, they realized that they were profoundly united not only by their Divine Origin, by also by the Deepest shared patterns of their experiences, longings, hopes, and fears. And beyond this, as [[The Story]] further illuminated the [[Meta Crisis]], it became clear that humanity also shared a Destiny; they would either succeed or fail together as one. 

The Image of [[The Story]] grew more beautiful and clear day by day, as more and more individuals, families, tribes, and nations awakened, shared, listened, and wove [[The Tapestry]] back together. 

As [[The Story]] illuminated [[The Narrative Universe]] big enough to encompass and unite them [[All]], it became easier and easier to orient, navigate, and move together. 

### Epiphany Five: One Highest Identity 

One of the most profound realizations that emerged from [[The Story]] related to [[Identity]]. 

As [[The Narrative Universe]] unveiled itself, they realized that after generations enslaved in [[The Caves]], they had forgotten Who They Were. 

One of the main features of [[The Game of Empire and Oligarchy]] played by the [[Keepers of The Caves]] was [[Divide and Conquer]]. Part of the logic was to Keep Divided To Keep Conquered. 

The two main tools of [[Divide and Conquer]] were [[Fear]] and [[Identity]], and they worked together. The Wolves would divide the sheep up into groups, categorize and name them, and pit them against one another. The more [[Fear]] they could sow along the lines of [[Us vs. Them]], the stronger the [[Hatred]] and [[Division]] between the groups grew. 

The stronger the fear, hatred, and division between groups grew, the more they dissociated from [[One Another]] and That Which They Shared In Common, and the more the Identified with their differences. 

Over the generations, this had resulted in the primary [[Identity]] of humanity shifting further and further away from [[Unity]], and growing more and more polarized and divided along a vast array of fractures and fault lines. 

As [[The Story]] came back together, so too did the memories of humanity about Who They Were. They remembered that [[In The Beginning]], [[One]]. They remembered that spiritually, biologically, psychologically, and practically, at the Highest and Deepest levels of analysis, they were [[All]] [[One Family]].  

One [[Family of Families]]. One [[Tribe Of Tribes]]. One [[Nation of Nations]]. 

As they looked back towards the [[Highest]] and [[Deepest]] thing they [[All]] shared in common, the [[One Thing]] that United the vast [[Diversity]], it always and inevitably came back to the [[One]]. [[God]]. [[Creator]]. The Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End. The Source and Sustainer. [[I Am]]. 

The remembrance of their [[One]] [[Highest Identity]] was a crucial turning point in [[The Story]]. The memory felt like coming home. 

The revelation of their [[One]] [[Highest Identity]] as [[One Family]] of [[God]] did not require that they abandon any of their other [[Lower Order]] Names. They had individual names. Team names. Local names. Bioregional names. Tribal names. Group names. Company names. National names. And they could keep them all. 

It was as if everyone who awakened was being simultaneously welcomed home and adopted by The Great Father back into [[One Family]]. They could all retain their individual and local names and affiliations, while joyfully taking back up their Highest [[New Name]] and the vast sovereignty, authority, and inheritance that was their as Children of The [[One]] King of Kings. 

### Epiphany Six: One Highest Citizenship 

As the remembrances of the [[New Story]] revealed to them their [[Highest Identity]] and [[New Name]], it became clear to them simultaneously that their [[Highest Citizenship]] was not in any of the [[SpatioTemporal]] Earthly tribes, kingdoms, or nations, but in the Universal and Eternal [[Kingdom of God]] that United [[All Creation]] as [[One]]. 

Like their [[Highest Identity]], being adopted back into their shared [[Highest Citizenship]] did not require that they cancel or revoke any of the lower order affiliations or citizenships they had previously attained. 

It only required that they joyfully take up the [[New]] and Higher Citizenship. 

Unlike the previous revolutions that pit [[Us vs. Them]] and destroyed the [[Old]] in order to bring forth the [[New]], this was not a revolution. It was a transcendence. 

As they [[Voluntarily]] adopted, and were adopted back into, a [[New]] and [[Highest Citizenship]], they discovered that the [[New Citizenship]] allowed them to retain the very best features of all that humanity had built over the millennia, while also affording the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] required to partner with [[One]] and [[One Another]] to meet the needs and solve the problems at hand. 

It was as simple as voluntarily taking up a [[New Name]], and voluntarily beginning to act out a [[New Game]], together. 

### Epiphany Seven: One Highest Vision, Aim, and Goal 

[[The Story]] had revealed Who They Were, Where They Were, and How They Got There. The [[Backward Looking Story]] was nearly complete. 

As they began weaving their individual and local stories into a shared [[Forward Looking Story]], they discovered a treasure of immeasurable worth. 

With each individual and local thread woven, an [[Image]], or [[Vision]], began to appear. As the Vision grew ever more clear, the excitement rippled throughout [[The Movement]]. 

It turned out that at the [[Deepest]] and [[Highest]] level, they all longed for and desired the same [[Future]]. In their heart of hearts, they all shared the [[Vision]] of [[What Should Be]]. 

[[The Narrative Universe]] was composed of a diverse array of metaphors, prophesies, hopes, and warnings about the future. On one hand, there were warnings about ending up in places that approached [[Hell On Earth]], imprisoned in Darkness and Oppression for generations. Their ancestors had been warned about the [[Hell]] they were now awakening from, and had proceeded into it anyway. Yet on the other hand, there was a positive and hopeful [[Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] that permeated throughout the prophesies. It leapt off the pages, the Light of Heaven even brighter when contrasted against the Darkness of Hell. 

It was a [[Vision]] of [[Perfection]]. The [[Ideal]]. The way things should be. It was as if it were written by Love on the hearts of every being. 

From tribes around the world, the prophesies all pointed to a time when humanity would awaken from a time of deep Darkness, the young and the old would reembrace one another, the masculine and feminine would heal one another, the eagle and the condor would fly together, and from North, South, East and West, people from every tribe, nation and people would return to [[The Great Banquet Table]] at the top of the [[Sacred Mountain]] to rediscover the [[Way]] of the [[One]]. 

And it was prophesied that when the [[Knowledge of God]] covered the Earth like floodwaters, the lion would lie down with the lamb, they would beat their weapons into tools of life, and no longer would they train their children to war. 

Reunited as [[One Citizenship Under God]], there would be no room for factions, division, or war. [[United As One]], there would be no "them" to war with. 

Perhaps the most magical part of the [[Universal and Eternal]] [[Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] was that it was not only perfect, but it continued to get [[A Little Better Every Day]] as [[All Creation]] worked together in [[Harmony]] to cause it to be so. 

And so it was that they rediscovered the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]], and adopted it as their one Highest Overarching and Uniting Vision, Aim, and Goal. 

All those who awakened and emerged from [[The Caves]] came to share a deep understanding of Where They Were Going, and [[Why]].  

[[The Promised Land]] beckoned. 

### Epiphany Eight: One Epic Quest Towards Destiny 

Another fascinating feature revealed by the [[Archetypical Narrative Structure]] was that across a vast array of unique local stories, [[The Promised Land]] was separated from [[The Caves]] (the place of slavery, darkness, oppression, and forgotten identity) by a vast [[Chasm]] or [[Wilderness]]. 

They also came to understand that [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] Of Greatest Worth required that they [[Progress]] together along a [[Way]] marked by a series of [[Challenges]], [[Obstacles]], and [[Milestones]]. 

One of the final and most dreadful Challenges was the [[Existential Threat]] posed by [[The Giants]] who guarded [[The Promised Land]]. 

Based on the conditions of those in [[The Caves]], the realities of the [[Meta Crisis]], and the heart of [[Love]] that desired for none to suffer in slavery or perish in [[The Fire]], they patterned [[The Story]] after the idea of One human species aboard [[Vessel Earth]], traveling together through the generations on an epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]]. 

In this part of [[The Story]], the adventure required attempting to [[Move]] the entire human population, [[FROM the Old TO the New]], within a single generation. 

The Epic Quest Towards Destiny, towards [[The Goal]] of Greatest Worth, was already under [[Way]]. 

It was an invitation from [[One]] to [[All]], to progress back towards [[Unity]], [[Harmony]], and [[Coherence]] through [[Love]].  

### Epiphany Nine: One Universal War 

As much as they [[All]] hated to admit it, the stories from around the world made it clear that like it or not, they had all been born into a world at war. They had not started the war, but if they ever wanted Peace and Harmony, they would have to finish it. 

While [[The War]] was manifesting in many diverse ways around the world, they came to understand that it was one. While the specific instances all had their unique local flavors, the Patterns that were warring with one another were [[Domain Independent]]. The actors in each locality were different, but the axes of battle were shocking similar. 

The ancient stories that were being resurrected and brought together with the New reminded them [[The War]] threatening to engulf the world was not primarily physical or local in nature. 

The [[Domain Independent Patterns]] at war were [[Deeper]] Spiritual Realities, pulling the strings of the various [[SpatioTemoral]] embodiments they were puppeting. Behind the [[Visible Power Structures]] were [[Invisible Power Structures]], and behind the [[Invisible Power Structures]] were deep, archetypical Spiritual Realities. 

While very much a physical Reality on Earth, [[The War]] was not primarily physical or local. It was primarily Metaphysical and Universal, 'spilling over' into this Realm of [[SpaceTime]]. 

To prevail, they would have to wage the war as such and fight it *On Earth As It Is In Heaven*. [[The Victory]] could only be attained in partnership with [[God]] and the Forces of Heaven. 

### Epiphany Ten: One Victory and Best Possible Future For All 

As terrifying as the prospect of an Epic Quest and Universal Spiritual War was to Many, the silver lining was that *when* the [[Force For Good]] prevailed and Realized [[The Goal]], [[The Victory]] would Unite humanity as One, and usher in the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

They discovered a Deep concept in The Story of Stories regarding the idea of a Meta War, a Meta Project, or a Meta Game. The basic Idea behind the Meta Game was that while [[All]] other [[Sub Games]] were playing themselves out in the various [[Domains]] of Time and Space, there was an Omni-Encompassing Universal and Eternal Game that was also being played on [[Deeper]] and [[Higher]] planes of [[Reality]]. 

If the Highest Meta Game could be won, then [[All]] other [[Sub Games]] would also be won simultaneously. [[The Victory]] would become a [[Meta Victory]] for [[One]] and [[All]]. 

At the Highest and Deepest [[Levels of Analysis]], The Story, The Quest, The Game, The War... they were all inextricably and ineffably aspects of One. 

And so it was established [[The Goal]] of [[The Quest]] and [[The Victory]] of [[The War]] could only be accomplished by [[All]] for [[One]], and [[One]] for [[All]].  
## VI. A New System, Strategy, and Plan 

Having recaptured [[The Plot]] of [[The Story]] and reunited around the [[Most Important Things]], it was time to embark on the Epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]]. 

Moved by [[The Spirit]] and the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] of [[One]] for [[All]], and desiring that none should perish or be [[Left Behind]] in [[The Caves]], a system, strategy, and plan began to [[Emerge]] to move the entire population [[FROM the Old TO the New]].  

Out of [[The Caves]], beyond [[The Boundary]], through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Promised Land]]. 
### The Movement: FROM The Old TO The New 

By 2023, the awakening and arising [[Force For Good]] had come to agree on the broad outlines of a [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

They understood that to spark [[The Movement]] out of [[The Caves]], beyond the [[Meta Crisis]], and towards the [[Land Of Promise]], all they had to do to begin was whisper the Truth in order to ignite the [[Tipping Point Strategy]]. 
 
[[One]] and 1 could awaken 2.  
2 could awaken 3.  
3 could awaken 5.  
5 could awaken 8.  
8 could awaken 13.  
13 could awaken 21.  
21 could awaken 34.  
34 could awaken 55.  
55 could awaken 89.  
89 could awaken 144.  

144 could awaken 144,000.  

144,000 could awaken 3%. 

3% could awaken 70%.

70% could awaken [[All]].  

The strategy and plan for a [[Whisper Campaign]] to catalyze [[The Movement]] FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]] was forged. 

An early Milestone was established, to Move 3% Beyond The Boundary by 2026. 

There would be many later challenges and battles to confront and overcome as they ventured into the [[Unknown]], but for now the [[Next Steps]] were clear.  
### Awakening, Inspiring, and Inviting One By One

As the awakened whispered and moved together, those who were ready to awaken would hear and begin stirring. As the stirred, those already [[On The Path]] would hear the rustling of chains, attend to the awakening, and do whatever was required to inspire and breathe life and hope back into the individual. 

At the [[Wise Right]] Time, they would extend [[The Invitation]] to join [[The Movement]]. 

Upon accepting [[The Invitation]], the individual would be led through an [[Orientation and Onboarding Process]] to ensure they understood [[The Rules]] of the [[New Game]], and knew how to follow the [[Milestones]] that marked the Way towards [[Freedom]]. 

To their astonishment and joy, it began working! As the awakened simply whispered and made their way towards The Boundary, those who were ready to hear heard.  

When they heard, they would partially awaken, cease chattering, and begin moving. 

As those making their way out of the [[Darkness]] of [[The Caves]] heard the rustling of chains from others who were awakening and beginning to Move, they would stop and liberate the newly awakened, orient them, set their feet [[On The Path]], and welcome them into the procession.  

It was like water when it pierces a dam. Just a few drops at first, sneaking their way through the smallest cracks. But once the first one made it out of The Caves, it was easier for the 2nd... and the 3rd... and the 5th... and the 8th... and the 13th... and the 55th... and the 144th... and the 144,000th...

It was a motley procession. Pale grey bodies, atrophied and weak on the outside but illuminated with strength and power by [[The Spirit]] rising within, began to stream past the Milestones that marked the [[Way]] beyond [[The Boundary]] and towards [[The Goal]]. It was immeasurably beautiful. They were rising. They would often have to stop and rest. When one stumbled, the others would steady her. When one fell, the others would lift him up.  

One by one, the movement had begun, and it was now only a matter of time until [[All]] who desired had awakened, arisen, united, and progressed [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. 
### Reestablishing Identity, Sovereignty, and Autonomy 

After generations in the slavery and oppression of [[The Caves]], one of the first steps in the [[Orientation and Onboarding Process]] was to help each [[Individual]] reestablish their Identity, Sovereignty, and Autonomy. 

This was not an easy or self-evident task. 

To formalize the [[Process]], each individual articulated a basic [[Story]], [[Identity]], [[Constitution]] and [[Field of Agreements]] to establish the boundaries of their first [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]]: their [[Self]]. 

The [[Story]] provided an articulated understanding for them and others of Where They Were, How They Got There, Who They Were, Where They Were Going, and Why. 

The [[Identity]] helped them and others remember Who They Are. 

The [[Constitution]] reestablished their a priori [[Sovereignty]], [[Freedom]] and [[Independence]]. 

The [[Field of Agreements]] established the [[Rules]] by which they agreed to conduct their [[Self]].  

Together, these documents formalized the first act of [[Self Governance]], reestablishing a Sovereign, [[Autonomous]] [[Conscious Agent]], liberated to move and advance towards [[The Goal]] of their own [[Free Will]] and [[Volition]]. 

### Entering The New Covenant 

For those who recognized that they could not advance beyond [[The Boundary]], through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Goal]] in isolation, an Individual [[Constitution]] and [[Field of Agreements]] was not enough. 

Having regained their [[Sovereignty]] and [[Independence]], they would have to once again make voluntary sacrifices and agreements in order to gain the benefits of collaboration and mutual aid, and remain in [[Reciprocal]] [[Right Relationship]] with their fellow travelers. 

To establish the Highest Order of Unity, Spirit, and Intention among all individuals advancing towards [[The Goal]], the concept of the [[New Covenant]] was resurrected and brought to the fore. 

As opposed to the lower order transactional and temporary relationships that marked the [[Old World]], covenantal relationship spoke to the sacred, eternal Right Relationship between [[One]] and [[All]], between the [[Creator]] and [[All Creation]]. 

The [[New Covenant]], unlike the written laws and constitutions that governed the [[Old World]], was unwritten and mediated by [[The Spirit]]. 

It was a matter of being impelled from deep within by Spirit, Intention, and Heart, rather than merely complying with the written word. 

Although it was unwritten, everyone knew what it meant and required, because it was written on the hearts of all people of [[Goodwill]]. 

Their individual Stories and Fields of Agreement illuminated it. 

The Spirit and Essence of the [[New Covenant]] were reflected as closely as possible in what came to be known as the [[Lionsberg Constitution]]. 

The sole purpose of what they eventually came to call by mythical name of [[LIONSBERG]] was to progressively Realize the New World they were progressing towards in partnership with [[God]] and [[One Another]]. 

The [[Lionsberg Constitution]] reflected and formalized the New and Higher Order Sovereignty and Citizenship that humanity was transcending into, and established a [[Commons]] where infrastructure, resources, and support could be aggregated and stewarded in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

All individuals, as a first act of emerging out of isolation and into community, were invited to incorporate by reference the Lionsberg Constitution into their Individual and local Constitutions, thereby voluntarily agreeing to [[The Rules]] of the [[New Game]] and the [[New Covenant]] that enabled [[All Creation]] to advance together in [[Harmony]] towards [[The Goal]]. 
### Forging and Joining Groups 

After reestablishing Sovereignty, Self Governance, Independence, and agreeing to [[The Rules]] of the [[New Game]], it was time for each awakening individual to forge or join a group. 

The surest way to fail and die in [[The Wilderness]] that separated the [[Old]] from the [[New]] was to attempt to struggle through it in isolation. 

[[The Wilderness]] would have to be crossed as a [[Team of Teams]], as a [[Tribe Of Tribes]]. 

Forging and strengthening groups that would adventure together on [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] was one of the most important functions of The Movement as a Whole. 

This Pattern of organizing required that small groups continually reach [[Agreements]] on overarching and uniting [[Purpose]] and [[Identity]], along with the next set of pragmatic [[Goals]] and [[Objectives]] that they could tackle together to help them and the Whole advance towards the next [[Milestones]] that marked the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]].  

Each Team was encouraged to become [[Self Governing]], [[Self Sustaining]] and [[Self Replicating]]. Forged with at least three members to start, successful teams would grow as they tackled more meaningful [[Quarterly Quests]] in their [[Zone Of Optimum Development]]. As the groups approached ten or twelve members, they would begin preparing to Self Replicate, and then they would split into two Autonomous Teams before they exceeded sixteen members. 

This ensured that the most successful teams were continually training and developing [[New Members]], and replicating themselves to help [[The Movement]] become as capable and powerful as possible. 
### Quarterly Quests 

To allow for flexibility and continual reformation of Teams based on the next [[Wise Right Thing]] to do, The Movement agreed to synchronize their local and collective [[Progress]] and [[Navigation]] around a quarterly [[Battle Rhythm]].  

The quarterly [[Battle Rhythm]] enabled [[The Movement]] to rest into a comfortable [[90 Day World]] that was long enough to tackle meaningful Quests and make meaningful Progress, and short enough to be reasonably predictable and not overwhelming as they ventured into the [[Unknown]].  

Each [[Autonomous]] Individual, Team, and Locality, understanding the overarching and uniting Vision, Strategy, and Plan, would discern, negotiate, and choose its own [[Quarterly Quests]]. 

Each one was encouraged to choose a [[Quarterly Quest]] that would keep them, individually and as teams, in their [[Zone Of Optimum Development]]. 

If they chose a [[Quarterly Quest]] that was too difficult, they would be unable to keep the [[Commitments]] they made to one another and to other [[Teams]] they were coordinating with. 

If they chose a [[Quarterly Quest]] that was too easy, they would be failing to learn, grow, and develop, thereby robbing them Selves and the Whole of the latent Gifts and [[Potential]] within them. 

Crucially, having all [[Progress]] occur via Teams enabled the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] to function. 

### Progressing as a Tribe of Tribes 

Progressing as a [[Tribe Of Tribes]] in this fashion was crucial for solving the mysteries of [[Unity]] and [[Diversity]]. 

United by [[One]] overarching and uniting [[Meta Goal]], and understanding the shared [[Vision]], [[Strategy]], and [[Plan]], each Team / Tribe / Locality was free to speak their own unique language, embody their own unique culture, manifest their own unique values, create their own unique processes, and be and do what they wished. Every one was [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]] and [[Free]]. 

Because all [[Collaboration]] was voluntarily forged from the bottom up, groups that did not resonate with or understand one another were free to choose to keep some distance, while ensuring that fear, factions, and divisions were not permitted to seep into [[The Movement]] towards [[Unity]] through [[Love]]. 

As diverse cultures, patterns, and practices flourished across the growing Family of [[One]], they began to share with [[One Another]] their most sacred writings, rituals, traditions, and practices. 

Liberated from [[Fear]] and [[United As One]], the vast [[Diversity]] was free to learn from [[One Another]], and to search for the [[Golden Thread]] of [[Spirit]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Truth]] that inevitably wove its Self through each of the diverse cultures, languages and perspectives. 

[[The Movement]] as a [[Whole]] was tremendously strengthened as the most Wise, Right, True and Good Ideas and Practices cross-pollinated themselves across the ecosystem. 

The [[Minimum Standards of Interoperability]] embodied by each individual, team, and locality in [[The Movement]] ensured that energy, communication, resources, and most importantly, [[Trust]] were able to [[Flow]] throughout the [[Whole]] as they progressed as a diverse [[Tribe Of Tribes]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

### Challenges, Obstacles, Issues, and Opportunities 

As the first Teams ventured out into the [[Unknown]] and began tackling [[Quests]], they immediately began encountering the [[Obstacles]], [[Issues]] and [[Challenges]] that stood in their [[Way]]. 

As Teams set out on their [[Quests]] they would inevitably have a member fall into a Pit, get caught by a Trap, or be swept away as they tried for cross a river. 

They would inevitably encounter [[Conflicts]], either internally, or with hostile tribes in [[The Wilderness]]. 

They would inevitably have to figure out what [[Roles]] they each were going to Play, and how they were going to practically divide up the [[Work]] and function as Team. 

They would inevitably have difficulty agreeing on the next [[Goals]] and [[Objectives]] they were going to tackle, or their order, priority, and sequence. 

They inevitably would fear running out of [[Resources]], and have to discern how to Resource their [[Work]]. 

They inevitably would struggle to follow [[The Rules]] and embody [[The Practices]] that they had agreed to. 

They inevitably would struggle with [[Accountability]] to One Another and the Whole. 

They inevitably would struggle to request, secure, and make the necessary [[Commitments]] required to [[Succeed]] in their [[Quests]]. 

They inevitably would have to figure out how they were going to [[Solve Issues]] and [[Make Decisions]].  

They inevitably would have to figure out how they were going to Govern them Selves, and participate in the [[Governance]] of the [[Whole]]. 

They inevitably would have to figure out how they were going to cross the rivers, scale the mountains, and navigate through the jungles. 

They inevitably would have to figure out how they were going to respond to [[Targets of Opportunity]].  

They progressively came to Realize that ninety percent of the [[Challenges]], [[Obstacles]], [[Issues]], and [[Opportunities]] they faced were common to [[All]]. 

As they began to build their shared [[Lionsberg Lexicon]], they called the issues they [[All]] shared in common [[General Issues]], [[General Needs]], and, [[General Problems]]. 

And they began to refer to those very few issues that were truly unique to a given team, time, or place as [[Specific Issues]], [[Specific Needs]], and [[Specific Problems]].  

It was similar for [[General Opportunities]] and [[Specific Opportunities]]. 
### Shared Infrastructure, Resources, and Support 

After growing frustrated watching each Team fall into the same pits and struggle in isolation to [[Reinvent The Wheel]], [[The Movement]] determined that one of the most important determinants of [[Success]] would be the [[Continuous Improvement]] of [[The Commons]] of shared infrastructure, resources, and support that connected, equipped and empowered [[All]] Individuals, Teams, and Localities. 

They further resolved to [[Do The Hard Work Our Selves To Make It Easier For Those Who Come After Us]]. 

Because [[No One Could Enter The Promised Land Unless And Until All Could Enter The Promised Land]], there was no reason for the early Teams to race ahead into [[The Wilderness]]. That would only serve to isolate them as other Teams struggled to Follow. 

Instead, as each of the early Teams encountered a General Obstacle or Issue, they would slow down and Do Their Best to forge a General Solution. 

For instance, when [[The Pioneers]] came to a river, understanding that millions would be coming after them, including many who were young, old, mothering, sick, or requiring extra support for any number of reasons, instead of powering across the river because they were able to, they would slow down and use their strength to build at least a rudimentary bridge that could be Continuously Improved by each Team who came along after them. 

This benefited [[The Pioneers]] by establishing stronger [[Supply Lines]] and [[Communication Lines]] between [[The Vanguard]] and rear of [[The Movement]], while saving the blood, sweat, energy, and tears of the following Teams for the new challenges to be confronted and overcome as they ventured deeper into [[The Wilderness]]. 

While the going was rough for [[The Pioneers]], each of the subsequent [[Cycles of Expansion]] found the [[Way]] to be easier and more clearly marked. 

The Teams in each Cycle developed a Practice of deep [[Gratitude]] for the hard work and effort of [[The Pioneers]] who had paved the [[Way]] for them, and reciprocated by [[Doing Their Best]] to leave every aspect of the Journey [[A Little Better]] than they found it. As the [[Supply Lines]] opened up, they also made sure to push knowledge, resources and support ahead to [[The Pioneers]] who were still leading the [[Way]] out into [[Unknown]]. 

Based on the timeless [[Wisdom]] of the [[Tithe]], a [[Culture]] developed in which each Team would dedicate at least the first tenth of its available [[Flow]] of Time, Energy, Resources, and Attention to strengthening, empowering, coordinating, and improving the Whole, while focusing the remaining ninety percent on its own individual and local Progress. 

This creating exponential cascading benefits for each Individual, Team, and Locality as The Movement grew, as the small [[Sacrifice]] of each Team was reciprocated by a growing Commons of infrastructure, resources, and support far beyond what they could have ever accessed in isolation.  

With each Cycle of Expansion, [[The Commons]] of shared infrastructure, resources, and support Flowing across [[The Movement]] grew richer and more empowering for [[All]]. 

Day by day, the [[Path]] towards [[The Goal]] opened up, welcoming the subsequent wave of [[The Movement]] into its growing embrace. 
### Governance and Navigation 

One of the most significant [[Challenges]] and [[Opportunities]] on [[The Quest]] was Governance. 

Liberated from [[The Caves]] and out in [[The Wilderness]] with [[Life]] and [[Death]], [[Success]] and [[Failure]] at stake, the day to day [[Process]] of [[Governance]] and [[Navigation]] became crucial. 

[[Out Here]], there were no Keepers to tell them [[What To Think]] and [[What To Do]]. [[Freedom]], [[Sovereignty]], and [[Autonomy]] came with a Cost. 

As they deeply considered the issue of [[Governance]], they remembered that the word “Govern” derived from the Latin meaning “To Steer”. 

It begged a very literal question: _How do we [[Individually And Collectively]] navigate and steer our Vessel(s) towards [[The Goal]]?_  

*Having fixed our [[Aim]], how do we get from [[Where We Are]] to [[Where We Are Going]]*? 

Having learned from the Story of [[The Exodus]], they knew that they had to [[Walk The Line]] between [[Chaos]] and [[Order]]. An excess of either could prove fatal. 

They also knew that their System of Governance would need to transform and continually improve to [[Meet The Needs, Solve The Problems, and Accomplish The Goals]] at hand as [[The Movement]] grew and advanced towards [[The Goal]]. 

[[The Pioneers]] had it easy. Alone in [[The Wilderness]], the first few teams could govern them Selves, communicate, and navigate together by intuition and on an ad hoc basis. 

However as [[The Movement]] grew from dozens, to hundreds, to thousands, and eventually to millions and beyond, any system that was either too centralized or too decentralized would be doomed to failure and collapse. 

In [[The Wilderness]] with life and death [[At Stake]], the shared System of Governance was perhaps the most crucial aspect of their shared infrastructure. 

The [[Lionsberg System of Governance]] was designed to emerge and evolve from the bottom up in response to the realities of [[The Quest]]. 

Fractal in nature, it was rooted in the fundamental understanding of the [[Sovereignty]] and [[Autonomy]] of each Individual, Group, and Locality.  

In accordance with the principle of [[Subsidiarity]], it required that every [[Decision]] be made at the least-centralized level possible. 

#### The Individual 

The first level of fractal governance in the system was rooted in the Self Governance, Sovereignty, and Autonomy of every Individual. 

#### First Degree Groups 

Following the [[Rule Of Three]], it encouraged Individuals to self-organize into [[First Degree Groups]] of at least Three. 

Following the [[Rule of Sixteen]], it encouraged Groups to split and Self Replicate prior to exceeding sixteen members. 

Bounding the fundamental unit of Decision Making, Questing, and Progress in [[Self Sustaining]], [[Self Governing]], and [[Self Replicating]] Teams of 3 to 16 established the basic framework for decentralization, empowerment, and subsidiarity. 

#### Second Degree Groups 

Following the same logic, it encouraged Groups to self-organize into [[Second Degree Groups]]. 

Whereas [[First Degree Groups]] were composed of Individuals, [[Second Degree Groups]] (and higher order groups) were Groups of Groups. 

Like [[First Degree Groups]], [[Second Degree Groups]] were also encouraged to follow the [[Rule Of Three]] and the [[Rule of Sixteen]], meaning that a Second Degree Group should contain at least three, and no more than sixteen, First Degree Groups. 

The [[Governance Circle]] of each second and higher degree group was composed of one representative nominated by each of the lower degree groups that composed it. This ensured that the governance circle at each level of analysis was composed of a circle of the three to sixteen individuals considered most wise and capable of higher order wisdom, discernment, and governance by the members of each constituent group. 

#### Third and Higher Degree Groups 

This fractal organizing principle continued all the way up to the highest levels of analysis, with the [[Whole]] of [[The Movement]] at any given point in time being composed of no less than three, and no more than sixteen Groups of Groups advancing as One Body towards [[The Goal]]. 

Assuming approximately 10 per group, this meant that: 

- First Degree Groups were composed of approximately 10 individuals  
- Second Degree Groups were composed of approximately 100 individuals  
- Third Degree Groups were composed of approximately 1,000 individuals  
- Fourth Degree Groups were composed of approximately 10,000 individuals  
- Fifth Degree Groups were composed of approximately 100,000 individuals  
- Sixth Degree Groups were composed of approximately 1,000,000 individuals  
- Seventh Degree Groups were composed of approximately 10,000,000 individuals  
- Eighth Degree Groups were composed of approximately 100,000,000 individuals  
- Ninth Degree Groups were composed of approximately 1,000,000,000 individuals  

Because the sizes of the tribes varied, the Tenth Degree Group ended up composing the Whole of Humanity into Twelve Tribes.  
#### The Highest Level of Analysis 

At the Highest Level of Analysis, the Whole was continually United As One Tribe of Tribes / Group of Groups, progressing towards [[One]] Vision and Goal. 

The establishment of Highest Order Functional Unity from the outset ensured that [[The Movement]] could never fracture or fragment. No matter how the [[Tribe Of Tribes]] morphed and reconfigured itself as [[The Movement]] grew, [[Unity]] eternally remained the essential requirement. 

The Fractal arrangement ensured that legislative, judicial, and executive functioning were distributed in an optimally decentralized way throughout The Movement, helping each Individual, Group, and Locality grow as strong and functional as it possibly could. 
#### Communicating, Making Decisions, and Solving Issues 

The various levels of organization were double linked to one another by the Systems of communication and coordination. 

In the event that a First Degree Group could not solve an issue, the issue would be elevated up the [[Escalation Ladder]] to a Second Degree Group it was a part of. 

In the even that the Second Degree Group could not solve the issue, it would continue to be elevated to higher level Governance Circles until it was finally resolved. 

The System of Communication ensured that information regularly and systematically flowed across The Movement, keeping everyone informed and ensuring optimum [[Decision Making]] at every level of analysis. 

### Co-Creating the Systems and Structures of the New World 

As the advancing [[Teams]] encountered issues, needs, and opportunities, they were solved systematically, and the solutions were cross-pollinated across The Movement. 

Soon, the Lionsberg System of Systems began to take shape. 

From basic needs like food, water, and shelter, to more complex systems of economic provisioning, governance, justice, society, and culture, and Lionsberg System and Toolkit ensured that each Individual, Group, and Locality was fully empowered to help one another flourish. 

Each and every issue and challenge they encountered in [[The Wilderness]] was a Gift, for it called forth a carefully crafted Solution that solved the issue not only for those who encountered it, but for [[All]] who would come after. 

Liberated from the false constructs of division, separation, competition, and [[Us vs. Them]], the most advanced ideas, solutions, and technologies were rapidly cross-pollinated across The Movement as they emerged. Unexpected Synergies continually surprised and delighted, unleashing new benefits and capabilities that accelerated [[Progress]]. 

Issue by issue, obstacle by obstacle, they co-created the Systems and Structures required for helping [[One Another]] flourish, even in [[The Wilderness]] that separated the [[Old]] from the [[New]]. 

The Systems were constructed around [[The Twelve Pillars of Lionsberg]], ensuring that every aspect of Life and Society was properly attended to. 

Soon, they began to forget about the defunct systems of governance, economy, society, and ideology they had suffered under in [[The Caves]] of the [[Old World]]. 

By [[Identifying And Solving Issues]] and [[Opportunities]], they were co-creating the Systems and Structures of the New World as they progressed, and learning how to co-operate them as they advanced. 

## VII. Confronting and Overcoming The Giants 

### Grappling with Obstacles in the Way 

As [[The Movement]] advanced they encountered a vast array of [[Challenges]] and [[Obstacles]] that marked the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

Far from growing discouraged when [[Obstacles]] manifested, they came consider each one a unique Gift and a marker [[Progress]]. 

In fact, over time they discovered that their [[Progress]] was directly proportional to their willingness to forthrightly confront and overcome the [[Obstacles]] that stood in their [[Way]].  

The magic in the [[Obstacles]] was that they called forth not only the coordinated [[Work]] required to address them, but they also required that [[The Movement]] *become* the kind of Body capable of confronting and overcoming such a Challenge. 

The learning and growth did not primarily occur on the bright and sunny days when the Universe was at rest and the wind was at their backs, but when they were forced to grapple together with the most difficult Realities that manifested in the [[Way]], objected to their [[Progress]], and threatened their ruin. 

The full array of Challenges, Obstacles, and Existential Threats they had to overcome will told in other sagas to come. 

For now, we will focus on one of the most frightening and daunting episodes; which is the Story of The Giants.

### The Giants - Fear and Trembling in The Wilderness 

The further they ventured into [[The Wilderness]], the more Perspective they gained and the clearer they were able to see the dynamics of [[The Caves]] and the [[Meta Crisis]] they were liberating themselves from. 

From inside the Systems of the [[Old World]], it was nearly impossible to see what was happening. 

However looking back at them from [[Beyond]], things became more clear. 

In fact, the Higher they ascended towards the [[New]], the more clearly they could see back down to specifics and features of the [[Old]] that had kept them and their ancestors imprisoned and enslaved for so many generations. 

The [[Keepers of The Caves]] had constituted the [[Visible Power Structures]] of the [[Old World]]. Sometimes they had called themselves Kings, sometimes Presidents, sometimes Prime Ministers, sometimes Pastors, sometimes Priests, sometimes Professors, sometimes Parliament...

...however as they ventured out [[Deeper]] into [[The Wilderness]], they discovered to their horror that what they actually had been were Puppets. 

While at the time the Puppets had seemed intimidating and threatening enough in their own right, a far more intimidating structure of Power was pulling their strings. 

As [[The Movement]] gathered momentum, the last holdouts began to exit [[The Caves]], and [[The Pioneers]] began to catch glimpses of [[The Promised Land]], there was a moment when the strings connecting the Puppets to their Puppeteers became visible. 

The strings led all the Way from [[The Caves]], through [[The Wilderness]], and to the boundaries of [[The Promised Land]], which The Pilgrims discovered to their horror was Possessed by [[The Giants]]. 

[[The Giants]] were a class of soulless abstractions, who had grown exceedingly powerful by dwelling beyond the Realities of the Old World, and parasitically preying on its inhabitants. 

The [[Invisible Power Structures]] puppeted the [[Keepers of The Caves]] from afar, pulling their strings, feeding them words to speak, and parasitically siphoning off energy, attention, and resources from those held captive in [[The Caves]] they had constructed. 

It was an ingenious and frightening system of exploitation. 

From within [[The Caves]], it had appeared that there were hundreds of competing nations, thousands of competing tribes, and millions of competing businesses. 

Looking back down from the boundaries of [[The Promised Land]], it became clear to [[The Pioneers]] that [[The Cacophony]] of [[The Caves]] was a surficial construct meant to keep the afraid, divided, and conquered. 

The [[Invisible Power Structures]] were far Deeper and more united than they could have imagined. 

And [[The Giants]] were preparing for War. 

With fear and trembling, [[The Pioneers]] reported what they were discovering, and shockwaves began to ripple through [[The Movement]].  

### The War 

There is not room in this first short story to tell the tale of [[The War]]. That will come later in the Trilogy. 

For now, remember to always look Deeper. 

Beyond the [[Visible Power Structures]] are the [[Invisible Power Structures]], and beyond the [[Invisible Power Structures]] is the Spiritual War. 

The Spiritual War can only be waged and prevailed in at the Deepest Level; in the metaphysical realm; in partnership with God. 

The perceived enemies in any domain are mere Puppets of the [[Domain Independent]] Spirits and Patterns possessing them. 

Remember the Meta Game. The Meta War. The Domain Independent Victory that brings simultaneous Victory in All other Domains. 

Look Deeper. 

## VIII. A Vision of the World To Come 

With each step further into [[The Wilderness]] they became more Free, and the more Free they became, the clearer the [[Vision]] of the [[New World]] became. 

The Intention 
The Vision 
The 12 Pillars 

## IX: Embarking on The Quest - Next Steps

## X: Tools For The Journey 


 

##### The Spiritual War

Over the millennia, this Spirit has been at war with an antithetical spirit characterized by the illusion of separation and self-supremacy. The [[Anti-Spirit]] rises up to assert its own supremacy and subordinate [[All]] things unto its false self through force. 

In incarnate form, the Spiritual War is most archetypically represented through the vision and prophesy of [[Christ]] and [[Anti-Christ]]. 

It is crucial to grasp there [[Archetypical]] concepts in the realm beyond religions forged by human hands and minds. Without doing soon, it is impossible to understand the Root Cause of the [[Meta Crisis]], and therefore impossible to confront and overcome it and realize [[The Solution]]. 

Here in [[SpaceTime]], the battle manifests itself in the way the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of each individual, family, tribe, nation, and power structure conducts the organism.

The [[Spiritual War]] is waged fractally within each domain, starting with the [[Individual]], and expanding up throughout the various aggregations of Individuals into tribes, nations, and [[Power Structures]]. 

##### Warring and Transforming Power Structures on Earth

Here on Earth, understanding the Spiritual War is essential to understanding that the Power Structures as we perceive them are not the real Power Structures. There is seldom any true power in the visible figurehead king, president, or prime minister. 

Behind the rise and fall of nations and empires, deeper and more persistent forces are at work, the [[Invisible Power Structures]] that control and often pit the [[Visible Power Structures]] against one another for their own narrow gain, and who continue to aggregate power in waves over successive generations of ascending and descending societal structures and public figureheads.

Looking behind the veil of the [[Visible Power Structures]], we come face to face with [[The Giants]]. 
##### The Ascendance of The Giants

As we gaze Beyond The Meta Crisis towards the [[Land Of Promise]] and the [[Collective Inheritance]] that beckons us forward, we are confronted by an army of Giants that stand in the [[Way]]. 

In [[The Story]], there are always Giants guarding the Land of Promise. One cannot simply waltz into the [[Best Possible Future]] and take up residence.
