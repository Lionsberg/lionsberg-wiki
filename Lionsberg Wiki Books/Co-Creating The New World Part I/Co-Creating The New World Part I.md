# Co-Creating The New World  

# Part I: The Meta Crisis and the Quest Towards The Goal 

## I. The Story of The Builder, Part I

Once upon a time, there was a community not unlike our own nestled in a valley at the foot of a tall [[Sacred Mountain]]. 

There came a time in its history when the community was mired in conflict, confusion, chaos, and hopelessness. 

In a small corner of the community, there was a Builder named Nicholas. 

His greatest heart's desire was to design and build a beautiful [[City on a Hill]], that would lift people up out of the darkness and despair of life in [[The Valley]], and serve as a Fortress of [[Hope]] and [[Inspiration]] for generations to come. 

He spent decades thinking, praying, discerning, and designing the intricate details of a [[Community]] where people could [[Flourish in Harmony]] with the Creator, One Another, and All Creation. 

Many in the community of The Valley thought it was a preposterous idea. The more The Valley drifted towards [[Chaos]] and confusion, the more abstract and out of touch the Idea of a flourishing and vibrant [[City on a Hill]] became. They called him a madman and a dreamer, they rejected and slandered him, and the authorities of The Valley sought to tear down his resources and reputation.  

Despite the hardship, Nicholas knew that he would be betraying his soul and purpose if he did not work tirelessly to realize what the Creator had placed on his heart since his earliest memories. 

After many years of designing, the plans were laid, the [[Meta Crisis]] was on the horizon, and Nicholas climbed up to the heights of the [[Sacred Mountain]] to begin work on the Magnificent City he had been shown, for the benefit, inspiration, and protection of the community of The Valley. 

He knew that they would need an [[Ark]] to carry them through the [[Chaos]] that lay ahead. 

As he began work, the villagers began to come out to see what he was building. The children mocked him and threw stones. A little girl shouted derisively "That is not a Magnificent City! It's a terrible pile of rubble."

"Wait and see, little one," he replied. "Someday this Great City may come to help you more than you know."

Another villager came by and said "Where is the well? How will the Great City get water?"

"A wonderful question," the builder said. "Let us review the [[Plans and Specifications]] together and see. Perhaps you could help improve them." 

The next day the villager came back with the local well expert. They reviewed the plans and specifications, made some improvements, surveyed the territory, and fixed the location of the well. 

"Wonderful," the builder said. "Now we have a wise design for nourishing the Great City with Living Water."

The local pastor came by a few days later, and asked "Where will the church be in the Great City?"

"A wonderful question," the builder said. "Let us review the plans and specifications together and see, perhaps you could help improve them." They reviewed the plans, and agreed that [[The Corner of Faith and Hope]] right along [[The Town Square]] would be a perfect location. 

The pastor was delighted, and a week later he brought back some [[Volunteers]] to review the plans, and to ask the Builder if they could begin laying foundations for the Corner of Faith and Hope. They were truly eager to begin building the church. 

"That is a wonderful idea," the Builder replied. "It would definitely help progress to begin laying the foundations for the Corner of Faith and Hope. We will just need a surveyor to lay out the streets and the boundaries around Town Square." 

"My uncle is a surveyor," one of the young men replied. "I am sure he would be delighted to come lay out the Town Square and the Corner of Faith and Hope so we could begin."

That weekend, a large crowd was up on the hill, surveying the town, setting stakes, marking corners, and imagining how beautiful the view from the Church and the Great City would be. 

A respected older man in the community approached the Builder out of the crowd. "I have carefully looked through your plans and specifications, and I think your roads are abysmal. They will never work, and they will be a catastrophe for anyone who attempts to use them. I do not want anything to do with your ill-conceived City on a Hill."

With a disgusted and cynical look, he turned and began to make his way back down the [[Way]] towards [[The Valley]]. 

The Builder called out after him "Please Good Sir, are you willing to help me? I do not pretend to know how to create the best roads, but if you are willing to share your [[Wisdom]] I am willing to [[Listen]]. Would you please take a few moments to explain to me how the roads are inadequate, and what changes we might be able to make to bring them to within your [[Range of Tolerance]]?"

The elder paused, and then reluctantly agreed that he could take a few minutes to point out the inadequacies in more detail. 

The Builder knew he would need the [[Wisdom]] of [[The Elders]], with the exuberance of [[The Youth]], and the strength of [[The Adults]] in order to [[Avoid Failure]] and [[Succeed]], no matter how difficult it was to get everyone working together. It would take the collaboration of all generations to [[Co-Create]] something truly [[Ideal]]. 

One of the members working on the layout of the church was a local grocer. "Where are you planning to set up the local shops?" he asked. 

"That is a wonderful question," the Builder replied. "Let us review the plans and specifications together and see, perhaps you could help improve them." They explored the design for a large cobblestone Main Street coming off Town Square, with local shops to provision the families of [[The Great City]]. As they talked, the grocer and the Builder began excitedly drawing plans for the layout of the store, the discussing the [[Supply Chains]] that would provision it. 

The next day the Builder climbed the [[Way]] up to the [[Sacred Mountain]] as he did every day, studying and praying over the plans and [[Progress]], and asking God to reveal and direct their [[Next Steps]]. As he was praying, a childhood friend from The Valley who had grown up alongside the Builder approached him and startled him out of his prayers. "I have been praying on [[The Mountain]] this morning," the friend said abruptly. "I hoped I would find you here. I am deeply troubled by your dangerous plan to build this City." He also cared deeply about the town, but felt strongly that any plan for Hope needed to involve working to transform The Valley below from within. "Your creative ideas are dangerous. You are up here trying to build a City in the clouds, while we are down in the trenches of The Valley fighting the true battle. God did not tell me to build a City on a Hill, God told me we need to build boundaries and protections against the threats [[At Hand]]." 

The Builder put his hand on his friends back. His friend was angry and stiff. "I agree with you brother that we must build boundaries for The Valley below. The threats at hand are indeed Great. I am a Builder and I know well how to build boundaries. Perhaps God has laid a [[Diversity]] of plans on the hearts of those uniquely called to [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] them. Perhaps what God has shown you is Wise, Right, and Good and needs to happen, and what God has shown me is right and good too. I bear witness with the Wisdom of your plan and would be glad to [[Help]] you. Would you be willing to help me as well? Perhaps we could share teams and logistics as we work to fortify the Old and build the New together."

The friend fell silent and thought. He had not considered that both could happen simultaneously. 

As they were talking, the little girl and some of her friends ran up out of breath after climbing up the mountain. She was amazed to see all the [[Progress]]. "Wow! Your pile of rubble is really coming to life! What are you doing now?" she asked.  

"We are co-creating a Great [[City on a Hill]], that will serve as a light, a fortress, and an inspiration for The Valley for generations to come. Would you like to see the plans for the school and playground?" 

The little girl was intrigued, and began imagining and dreaming with the Builder about what kind of school and playground they might be able to co-create. As she talked and dreamed, the Builder wrote her ideas down in the plans and specifications, and modified [[The Design]] to reflect her creativity and insight. "That will be a great improvement to The Design," the Builder told her. "I can't believe I left out the swings. What a silly mistake. Thank you very much for helping me design and build this City on a Hill."

After the little girl and her friends scampered away, the Builder turned back to his childhood friend, who was glaring at him with a hard look on his face. "I just don't think we can trust you. Remember in our youth when you had the bright of idea of building a cart to help us carry our supplies? I still remember the lashing my father gave me after the wheels fell right off and all our hard earned supplies tumbled down into the river. What makes you think that you can build an entire City on a Hill? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole damn thing tumbled down the mountain after the first little storm. Just think of how disappointed everyone will be in you then. When that happens, I'll tell them I warned them, and say "I was right about him all along."

The Builder grew thoughtful. "You are absolutely right. I am completely unqualified. I have never built a City on a Hill. No one has. I can only do my best, and hope that the other qualified members of the community will help. I never said I could build a City on my own. Fortunately, the well expert has fixed the well, the road expert has fixed the roads, the grocer has fixed the shops, and the little girl has fixed the playground. Because of all their help, I am confident that the City is growing sound and strong."

Day after day, week after week, more and more people streamed up the Sacred Mountain, studied the plans and specifications, and began to dream and design and build together around the parts of The City they each cared about and valued the most.

While there were plentiful trials, tribulations, and conflicts along the Way, the City on a Hill offered the [[Citizens]] of The Valley an inspiration and Hope that had been missing for generations. 

In partnership with God and One Another, they were co-creating a truly Magnificent City. It was rising up before their eyes, and getting [[A Little Better Every Day]] as they worked together in [[Harmony]] to cause it to be so.

## II. The Story of The Caves, Part I

### Wisdom Cries Out 

From Proverbs: 

_[[Wisdom]] cries out in the streets._   

_She lifts up her voice in the public square._   

_At the head of the noisy streets she calls out._  

_At the entrance of the city gates she declares her sayings:_    

_How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking? And how long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, and fools hate [[Knowledge]]._    

_Turn to my rebuke, behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you; I will make my words known to you._  

_Make your ear attentive to [[Wisdom]]. Incline your heart to [[Understanding]]._    

_For if you cry out for [[Insight]], and raise your voice for [[Understanding]];_  

_If you seek me as silver and search for me as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the [[One]], and discover the [[Knowledge]] of [[God]]._    

_For the [[One]] gives [[Wisdom]]. From His mouth come [[Knowledge]] and [[Understanding]]._  

_He stores up sound [[Wisdom]] for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in [[Integrity]], guarding the paths of [[Justice]]…_  

_Then you will [[Discern]] [[Righteousness]], [[Justice]], and [[Integrity]], and every [[Good]] [[Path]]._  

_For [[Wisdom]] will enter your heart, and [[Knowledge]] will be delightful to your soul; [[Discretion]] will watch over you, [[Understanding]] will guard you, to rescue you from the way of evil._  

_Yet because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; and you neglected all my advice and did not heed my rebuke;_  

_I will also laugh when your dread comes like a storm, and your disaster like a whirlwind._  

_For the faithlessness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them._  

_But whoever listens to me will live securely, and be at ease from the dread of evil._  

### The Right Questions 

If we stop. If we [[Pray]]. If we [[Meditate]]. If we [[Listen]] deeply enough. We can hear the voice of [[Love]] calling us up and away from suffering and bondage, and into the fullness of [[Life]], [[Purpose]], and [[Destiny]].  

_We were created and destined for so much more than this._  
 
There has never been a more important moment in history to stop and ask. To stop and listen. To open our ears to what the Spirit is saying. To ask ourselves individually and collectively the great questions of life:  
 
“Who am I?”  
 
“Who am I becoming?”  
 
“Who or what is creating and sustaining my [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]]?”  
 
“Who or what is creating and sustaining the universe?”  
 
“Is the [[Source and Sustainer]] at least as [[Conscious]] as I am”?  

“Does the [[Source and Sustainer]] speak?”  
 
“What is the [[Source and Sustainer]] saying?”   
 
“To whom is the [[One]] speaking?”  
 
“What is the meaning, purpose, and destiny of [[Life]]?”  
 
“What is the meaning, purpose, and destiny of _my_ life?”  
 
“Who are we?”  

“Where are we?”   

“Why are we here?”  

“How did we get here?”  
 
“What the hell is going on around here?”  

“Why is it so dark in here?”  
 
“How did it come to this?”  
 
“Why is there all this sickness, disease, corruption, and suffering?”  

"Why is there all this Love, Joy, Goodness, and Wonder?"  

“What is my relationship to suffering and those who suffer?”  
 
“What is my relationship to those who consciously cause suffering?”  

“What is my relationship to structures of injustice?”  
 
“What is the meaning of this?”  
 
The questions and the answers are eternal and universal.  
 
They hold the keys to our survival and [[Success]].  
 
They have been spoken by prophets, sages, and grandparents throughout the millennia.  

They can be summarized in a single word, because they reflect aspects of an [[Ultimate Reality]] that is a fundamental [[Unity]].  


 
Yet that single word is only a sound. It is only a tool. It sounds different in every language. Yet all the words point to [[One]] so much deeper and so much more profound that no words could ever fully articulate It.  

Follow the [[Right Questions]], and you will always arrive back to the [[One]].  













### Unmoored in the Seas of Chaos 

You are asleep.

Imprisoned within a [[Vessel]] that has come unmoored in the midst of the storms, and is being violently driven and tossed by the waves in the roiling seas of [[Chaos]]. 
 
The Spirit that confronts and overcomes the darkest terrors and forges [[New Order]] out of their ashes is on the move. 
 
It is calling you. It is whispering to you. It is breathing into your lungs. It is beating into your heart. It is inviting you. 

Deep is crying out to Deep...  

The Depths of All that Is, crying out to Depths of All that Is You... 

_"Wake up!"_
 
_"Awaken! Arise! Remember who are you are!"_

You begin to stir, becoming vaguely aware of the vice-like grip of the induced coma on your [[Consciousness]].

_"Wake up! It is not real. You have been dreaming. You have been asleep for a very long time..."_  

_"Awaken and grab the helm!"_  

_"Arise, and remember who you are!"
  
_"Take up your rightful [[Authority]], and [[Navigate]] towards [[Life]] and [[Light]]!" 

The whisper is shattering. It roars like thunder. It hurts. 

_"You are in great danger. We must go! Quickly now!"_

One eye half opens, then closes. There is little difference. It is dark. It is wet. It is cold. It is stagnant. It smells like death. 

You start to drift back into the coma. 

_"Wake up! It is time. Up now! Here we go!"_ 

The eyes of your [[Consciousness]] blink without opening. 

_"Open your eyes. Look. Attend. Courageously face down that which you least want to look at!''_

_"Brave the storms you are most terrified to venture out into!"_

_"Grab the helm and transform the [[Vessel of Society]] into an [[Ark]] that can carry [[All]] safely onward towards their [[Destiny]]."_

The whispering Voice feels like it is shattering your ear drums. As you try to move your arm, it is heavy, and doesn't move. You try to open your eye again, but the lid does not budge. 

You long to cover your ears and shut it all out, but the Voice is within, and your limbs are frozen. 

What is this madness? Is it a dream? 

The Voice grows firm. 

_"Now."_

The Spoken Word sounds like the _roar of many waters_, echoing through the depths of the Earth. 

It finally startles you awake into a nightmare. 

_"I have been trying to awaken you for a very long time. Your life is in danger. You are going to have to trust Me. We must move quickly, and I will explain things along the [[Way]]._

_"Who are you?"_ you ask...

_"I Am," the Voice thunders in reply._

_"Could you please speak more softly? Your voice is hurting my ears."_

_"I am whispering as softly as I can. Your ears will soon attune to My Voice. It has been a long time since they have heard."_

As the energy of the Voice permeates your [[Consciousness]], your [[Embodiment]] slowly comes back towards life. 

*"Open your eyes."

With tremendous effort, first one eyelid opens, then the other. 

As your eyes strain to adjust to the darkness and you try to move, the first subtle movement brings the sound of chains to your ears. Your body feels sore, weak, and cold, and you soon realize you are helpless. 

It is quiet, except for an eerie mechanical din, and a strange sort of cacophonous chanting. 

The ground feels like it is rolling beneath you. 

*"Quickly now, awaken and arise. It is time to go."*

_"But how will I stand?"_

_"Do not fear. I will carry you."_

At once, you are swept up into the air and your chains rip free of the wall.

_"Quickly now, the Authorities will be along soon, and it is not yet time to wake the others. We have much work to do, and much to prepare for."_

### The Caves

Covered in the ethereal cloak of the Spirit, you are swept along through the cool damp air, a tangible contrast to the enveloping warmth embracing you. 

An occasional fire casts flickers of light onto the walls, and you begin to make out figures. 

Millions of them. Billions of them. 

Chained to the walls of their caves. 

_"Where are you taking me?"_

_"Beyond."_

_"Beyond what?"_

_"Beyond the [[Boundary]]."_

_"What [[Boundary]]?"_

_"My Voice will wake the others if I speak, and what I am about to show you is beyond your ability to conceive of it. Be quiet and try to [[Perceive]], and we will discuss it when we are out safely Beyond."_

The nightmare you witness as your soar through the cavernous darkness stands in stark contrast to the grey dreams that are your only recent memories. 

Pale bodies, billions of them, chained in the darkness. Shallowly breathing. Scarcely alive. 

As your eyes adjust to seeing for the first time, you begin to [[Perceive]] the terrain. 

It becomes apparent that you are making your way through some kind of vast network of caves. Some are so enormous that the sea of bodies they hold fades out beyond view, and others are tiny, containing a single human in tormented isolation. 

Strange beings stand guard at the mouth of each cave. As you look more closely at the beings, you can see that although they wear clothes, they are decaying, as if their very essence is rotting from within. They speak incessantly, uttering the same words that strangely seem to be flowing in response from the mouth of the cave. 

Are the caves speaking? 

As your ears continue to discover how to hear, they gradually attune to the cacophony, each sound becoming magnified - a relentless assault on senses newly awakened to the din of chaos and despair.

Descending through a narrow pass, you come close enough to the mouth of a cave to get a better glimpse of the captives within. 

They are asleep, but they are speaking! The words coming from the mouths of the caves are the words coming from the mouths of their inhabitants in unison, and the words coming from the mouths of the captives are the mindless repetition of the incessant chatter of the Keepers of that cave. 

Involuntarily, you suddenly find yourself vomiting out pale grey liquids, that cascade down onto the pale grey bodies uttering the pale grey words into the pale grey expanse of the caves.

The Spirit grips you tighter and you feel... something that you have no words for. 

_"Am I... one of those?"_ you ask the Spirit with horror...

_"No."_ The Spirit whispers firmly. _"You were one of those, but now you are awake. That is why it was so hard to wake you. It is nearly impossible to hear My Voice while you are mindlessly repeating the empty words of the Keeper of your [[Cave]]."_

Confronted with a terror so profound, a realization so appalling, and a cacophony so deafening, your body rejects the overwhelming horror with another wave of nausea and vomiting, before darkness claims you, and you succumb once again to unconsciousness.

_To Be Continued..._








## III. The Meta Crisis 

### Awakening to the Dreadful Realization 

As humanity edged its way into the [[New Millennium]], one by one individuals began awakening to the horror of their slumbering and cacophonous captivity within [[The Caves]], with each revelation spreading like a spark of wildfire. 

From the first few to hundreds, then thousands, the awakened souls sought out and began to find [[One Another]], sharing [[Information]] and collaboratively piecing together the reality of the shared condition they were emerging from and into. 

Alarmingly, with each piece of [[Information]] shared and every truth uncovered, the reality of their plight deepened, revealing a situation far more dire than any had imagined. 

It was bad enough that billions were held captive and asleep in [[The Caves]]. 

Yet, an even more alarming realization dawned: the entire [[Human System]] and [[Living System]] had suffered such profound abuse and exploitation by the Keepers of The Caves that a systemic collapse was imminent. 

The proverbial building was not just on fire—it was ablaze, with the vast majority still obliviously slumbering within its walls.

### The Array of Crises 

Gradually, from myriad perspectives, they pieced together the grim reality. With each and every unique observation of an apparently unrelated systematic issue, the evidence of a deep [[Meta Crisis]] grew more and more irrefutable. 

An awakened scientist revealed that even the rainwater in Earth's most remote areas was tainted with toxic chemicals.

An awakened politician warned that the Keepers of the Caves were steering their captives toward a global war.

An awakened pastor informed the others that spiritual leaders were being silenced, beaten, ostracized, and even killed if they did not parrot the lines of the [[Power Structures]]. 

An awakened economist informed the others that the financial and monetary systems had come unmoored from [[Reality]], and were floating away towards failure and collapse. 

An awakened teacher revealed the school curriculums' deep corruption, indoctrinating children into failure, division, dysfunction, and despair.

An awakened worker highlighted the widening opportunity gap between the many and the few reaching a critical breaking point. 

An awakened farmer exposed how [[The Giants]] were intentionally devastating bioregional food systems and production capacity. 

An awakened lawyer informed the others that the courts had become so corrupted that they only offered respite to those wealthy enough to be able to manipulate them. 

An awakened botanist reported plant ecosystems dying off due to the scarcity of insects and pollinators.

An awakened entomologist informed the others that two thirds of many insect populations had collapsed in an insect apocalypse as a result of habitat loss, pesticides, agricultural chemicals, pollution, and disease. 

An awakened zoologist informed the others that two thirds of many animal populations had collapsed for similar reasons. 

A reproductive specialist informed the others that the sperm counts of human males had also collapsed by nearly 2/3rds over recent decades. 

An awakened doctor informed the others that the food and drink being provided to the [[Employee Consumer Slaves]] in [[The Caves]] was full of toxic chemicals that inhibited key biological functions and triggered [[Chronic Inflammation]], leading to skyrocketing [[Chronic Disease]]. 

An awakened microbiologist informed the others that much of the collapse in health and life in insects, plants, animals, and humans was actually the result of the destruction of the [[Microbiome]]. 

An awakened supply chain manager outlined how global supply chains had become critically fragile, teetering on the brink of collapse from minor disruptions.

An awakened banker illuminated the historic rates of debt after thousands of years without a [[Jubilee]], and the essential bankruptcy of various tribes and nations. 

An awakened psychologist informed the others of skyrocketing rates of mental health issues, addiction, anxiety, depression, and suicide. 

An awakened aid worker informed the others of skyrocketing rates of mass migration, and the attendant risks of disease, conflict, and war. 

An awakened social scientist informed the others of the degree to which the schools, universities, governments, and other civic institutions had fallen prey to ideological capture. 

An awakened voter informed the others of the thousands of dollars being spent by the [[Invisible Power Structures]] on every vote, the predatory presence of multiple lobbyists for every official, the extent of [[Regulatory Capture]], and the unholy alliances between religious denominations and political parties. 

An awakened student informed the others of the youth of the nations being coerced into student debt spirals and lifelong debt slavery in return for failed educations. 

An awakened juror informed the others about the extraordinary rates of institutionalization and incarceration in the empires of the Earth, and profound perversions of Justice. 

An awakened senior informed the others about the degree of elder abuse and neglect, and the tremendous suffering, loneliness, and alienation of the older generations. 

And it was evident to All that after generations imprisoned in [[The Caves]], any semblance of uniting [[Vision]] and [[Values]] had been destroyed. Society was divided against itself and the Earth, and rapidly failing. 

These are but a small sampling of the stories that specialists in a diverse array of [[Domains]] told one another. The varied reports from different perspectives wove together a tapestry of crises, each thread revealing more and more of the underlying [[Meta Crisis]].  

In the end, the experience of one confirmed another, and statistically the probability that everything was ok and the existing [[Human System]] would survive rapidly approached zero. 
### The Meta Crisis 

Eventually, they came to refer to the crisis of crises they were collectively facing as the [[Meta Crisis]]. The [[Meta Crisis]] was an unprecedented [[Existential Threat]] that nearly disqualified humanity from ongoing existence aboard Earth. It was a universal challenge that threatened the very fabric of [[Society]], and the [[Living System]] that contained it. 

Arising from the [[Way of Being]] of the Human Species aboard Planet Earth, they came to understand that the [[Meta Crisis]] demanded a profound and historic [[Citizen Led Response]]. Before it was too late. 

By the early 2020s, [[The Story]] escalated to a climactic tension, teetering on the edge of absurd comedy and despair, with the fate of our heroes—and the human species aboard Earth itself—shrouded in uncertainty. 

## IV. The Story of Stories 

### Time To Awaken, Arise, and Move

Finding them Selves on the brink of catastrophic failure, mired in [[Chaos]] and [[Division]], and hurtling towards [[Collapse]] and [[World War]],  something strange happened to humanity. 

It was as if the overwhelming intensity of the Cold and Darkness of The Caves, contrasted with the searing heat of the wildfire slowly consuming Society, inadvertently conspired to awaken the Citizens as the [[Vessel of Society]] accelerated towards [[The Chasm]]. 

The awakening was exponential, and spread far more rapidly than anyone would have imagined. It was As If something Deeper was on the move, shaking humanity one by one out of their near-fatal slumber. 

Awakening in the Darkness, feeling the searing Cold and the chilling heat, hearing the chains, and catching flickering glimpses of [[The Chasm]], it was obvious to each as they awakened that it was time to arise, liberate One Another, and *Move*, *NOW.*

They may not have known yet Where [[They Were Going]] or [[Why]], but it was exceedingly obvious that [[They Could Not Stay Here]]. 

It was also self-evident that What Had Got Them To Where They Were, Divided and Enslaved In The Caves, Would Not Carry Them Forward To Where They Wanted To Go. 

### Reconstructing The Story 

The Guides among them were wise enough to understand that without a uniting [[Vision]], people perish. 

They were also wise enough to understand that [[Consciousness]] fundamentally lays its Self out in a [[Narrative Framework]], such that the [[Vision]] had to be contextualized within a uniting [[Story]].  

The Project of reconstructing [[The Story]] of humanity aboard [[Vessel Earth]] was one of the most profound early challenges of [[The Quest]]. 

After generations enslaved in [[The Caves]], humanity had entirely lost the plot. It had forgotten Who It Was. It had forgotten Where It Was. It had forgotten Where It Was Going. It had forgotten Why. It had lost the Sacred Vision. 

The vast majority of them had spent their entire lives asleep in [[The Caves]], mindlessly repeating, day after day, the words of the Keepers of their cave. 

The words of [[Keepers of The Caves]] had been progressively weaponized over the generations, growing ever more insidious and neurotoxic, warping the [[Neural Architecture]] of the captives with one primary goal: 

*To keep them asleep, divided, and conquered.* 

Above all, the warping of the [[Neural Architecture]] was *consciously designed* to prevent humanity from being able to [[Know]] the [[Truth]] that would inevitably set them free. 

Fortunately, [[The Spirit]] was on the move, revealing [[Truth]] and shattering [[The Chains]]. 

With each subtle realization and death of a falsehood, each being was being transformed from within. 

### The New Story 

Understanding the the [[Old Stories]] were inherently false, divisive, and incompatible with [[Where They Were Going]], the early awakeners began co-creating a [[New Story]]. 

They understood that they would need to reconstruct a shared [[Backward Looking Story]] that contextualized Who They Were, Where They Were, and How They Got There. 

Rediscovering Who and Where They Were, they also understood that they would need to reconstruct a shared [[Forward Looking Story]] that contextualized Who They Were Becoming, Where They Were Going, With Who, How, and Why. 

### The Story of Stories 

[[The Spirit]] helped them understand that [[The Story]] would need to be both a [[Unity]] and a [[Diversity]]. 

They began to refer to it as a [[Story of Stories]]. 

It would be co-created and [[Emerge]] as each individual, family, group, tribe, and nation awakened, arose, rearticulated their own [[Individual And Local Story]], and wove their unique threads into [[The Story]] that was progressively reorienting and reuniting them [[All]]. 

Day by day, as the [[Individual And Local]] threads of [[The Story]] were woven into [[The Tapestry]], a clearer and clearer [[Image]] began to [[Emerge]]. 

The clearer the [[Image]] became, the more their [[Imagination]] opened, and the more [[Wisdom]], [[Courage]], and [[Strength]] they gained. 

After generations and generations of isolation and conflict, they were discovering that they were no longer alone. 

As they reconstructed [[The Story]], everyone was consciously aware that they were constructing a Myth. 

However they also knew that the Myth they were co-creating was far more [[True]] than the stories they used to believe. In fact, they came to understand that it was the Truest thing they collectively knew. 

## V. The Ten Realizations

As [[The Image]] of [[The Story]] became progressively clearer in everyone's Minds, a series of Profound Realizations began to dawn on them. 

Among the hundreds of epiphanies, a small handful began to rise to the top as the [[Deepest]] and [[Most Essential]].  
### Epiphany One: In The Beginning, One

Despite the vast diversity of origin stories among the tribes and nations, the awakened were delighted to discover that nearly all of their stories started with a humble recognition of the Divine Beginning. 

As they wove the threads of the [[New Story]], they came to understand that this was not an elementary religious proposition. It was a statement of humility, an acknowledgement that beyond "our tribe" is humanity, beyond humanity is Earth, beyond Earth is Universe, and beyond Universe is the Ineffable Mystery that is creating, sustaining, permeating, and breathing life and breath into All things. 

The [[Ultimate Reality]] guiding the subsequent transformations of [[Reality]] across Space and Time. 

That which in English we point towards with [[Word Tools]] such as [[God]], [[Creator]], [[Ultimate Reality]].  

The beginning of [[The Story]] was different different across the diversity of tribes, and nations, yet [[All]] pointed back to [[One]]. 

The beginning of [[The Story]] sounded [[Something Like]]: 

In the beginning... 

_...there was nothing but One. All things had not come into being, and no thing existed except that which was possible in the Mind of the One._ 

In the beginning...

_…[[God]] created the heavens and the earth..._
 
In the beginning…

_…the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder._
 
In the beginning…

_…the earth was a formless and desolate void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the [[Spirit]] of [[God]] was hovering over the waters…_
 
In the beginning... 

_…the world was endless space in which existed only the [[Creator]]... The world had no time, no shape, and no life, except in the [[Mind]] of the [[Creator]]…_
 
In the beginning… 

_…something formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; silent and amorphous, it stood alone and unchanging, ever present and in motion. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I call it [[Tao]]. For lack of a better word I call it [[Supreme]]…_
   
In the beginning…

...*transcendent of every Story, Theology, Philosophy, and Logic is One Absolute, Primordial, First, Deepest, Ultimate Fact, whose Supreme Nature is a Mystery.* 

Before and beyond every name; before and beyond every attempt to grasp and comprehend; before and beyond every attempt to institutionalize; before and beyond every temple, idol and representation…
 
…from the [[One]], [[All]] things come into Being, and nothing comes into Being except through the [[One]]. 

*I Am.* 

They realized to their great delight that beyond religion, tribe, and nation, [[In The Beginning]], [[The Story]] was [[One]]. 

The rediscovery of the [[Knowledge of God]] beyond religion paved the Way towards the [[New Covenant]]. 

### Epiphany Two: One Interexistence 

The second great epiphany from [[The Story]] was that [[All]] things arising from the [[One]] were ultimately interconnected and interexistent. 

While the Song of Creation was subtly different in every tribe, those awakening could recognize that the variations were all harmonies in [[One]] [[Divine Symphony]]. 

In each Song of Creation, from [[One]] the [[Creative Field]] emerges into view, the primordial fabric of unstructured [[Potential]] from which, upon which, and through which [[All]] things arise. 

Every transcending and hovering over the [[Chaos]] of unstructured [[Potential]] was something like the [[Central Animating Spirit]]. 

And in-forming the animation of [[Potential]] into [[Form]] was something like the [[Logos]], or articulated Word and Logic of [[God]]. 

They came to understand that Creation was neither an random accident or a past event, but an ongoing Co-Creative [[Process]]. 

As if commanded by a Word, the [[Anti-Entropic]] Force is set into motion, the formless begins to coalesce into [[Form]], [[Chaos]] begins to ascend into [[Order]], and the elementary particles of the universe begin to assemble themselves.

Great processes of clustering, merging, synthesis, and fusion are unleashed. 

The [[Creative Field]] is moved into its subtlest forms, the subtle forms periodically gravitating into subatomic particles, subatomic particles uniting into nuclei, nuclei into atoms, atoms unite into stars, stars unite into galaxies, galaxies unite into clusters, galactic clusters uniting into galactic superclusters, and the galactic superclusters remaining interexistent aspects of One Body of Co-Creation. 

Over epochs and across the infinite field, One universal flower was unfurling its Self in obedience to its [[Metaphysical DNA]], each of its constituents alternately gravitating into Form, radiating back into Potential, and continuously spiraling up towards Higher Form. 

Perfectly ordered and consistent in Pure Principle and Design, from the highest-level concept to the lowest level detail, One Intelligible and Intelligent Cosmos was co-evolving in pursuit of the [[Logos]] and [[The Goal]] of the [[One]]. 

Among the billions of galaxies was one whose humans named it Milky Way; among whose billions of stars was one whose humans named it Sun; among whose many orbiting objects was one whose humans named it [[Earth]]. 

Among the trillions of planets manifest throughout the [[Creative Field]], the conditions on [[Earth]] were perfect for [[Life]]. 

Graduating from the endarkened understanding of previous centuries in [[The Caves]], awakening humanity came to deeply and progressively Realize that Earth, and all its inhabitants, were interexistent constituents of One Interexisting [[Living System]]. 

The [[Logos]] and the [[Conditions]] of [[Earth]] had conspired with Spirit to breathe forth a vast diversity of [[Life]].  

Among the [[Diversity]] emerged a unique being unlike any other, and yet one with them. 

Human Beings. Conscious cultivators, guardians, stewards, and [[Co-Creators]] of their experience aboard Earth. 

Endowed with creative [[Consciousness]], they shared with the [[One]] the Image and Power to consciously create and destroy by aggregating and channeling [[Energy]] towards consciously chosen goals and objectives, in response to consciously perceived issues, challenges, needs, threats, fears, and desires. 

For the first time, all those who were awakening to the [[New Story]] came to understand their Ultimate Interexistence as incarnate local aspects of One [[Living System]] that contained, sustained, and ultimately United them [[All]]. 

From this epiphany of interexistence, awakening humanity began to reconceptualize its unique role and [[Way of Being]] aboard [[Vessel Earth]], understanding that what each human being did or did not do unto any aspect of the Living System, it did or did not do unto its [[Self]], [[One]], and [[All]]. 

### Epiphany Three: Billions of Backward and Forward Looking Stories 

As humanity reconstructed [[The Story]], rediscovered their [[One]] Divine Beginning, and Progressively Realized their Ultimate Interexistence, the vast Diversity of their billions of unique stories were illuminated in greater detail than ever before. 

Far from suppressing their [[Diversity]], the dawning realization of their Ultimate Unity created the fundamental [[Conditions]] within which each [[Individual]] and [[Locality]] could freely express their unique [[Story]] without fear, for the first time. 

Whereas [[The Illusion of Separation]], the environment of [[Fear]], and the [[Us vs. Them]] mentalities fostered by the Keepers of [[The Caves]] had suppressed Diversity of expression, the Epiphany of Intereexistence and the co-creation of a [[New Story]] inherently contained within itself the invitation for every individual and locality to freely and truly express their unique individual and local [[Story]]. 

As more and more individuals, families and tribes awakened and began articulating their Stories, and as those stories began to be deeply listened to for the first time, humanity was shocked to realize that beyond the whitewashed histories and propaganda they had been force-fed in [[The Caves]], billions of unique stories and perspectives longed to be told. 

With a [[New Story]] big enough to embrace them [[All]], the vast diversity was finally free to truly articulate Who They Were, and their unique backwards and forward looking Stories. 

### Epiphany Four: One Uniting Story 

As the vast diversity of individual and local stories poured forth from [[All]] those awakening, they were continually reminded that without a [[New Story]] big enough to reunite them [[All]], the emerging Movement would tear itself asunder. 

As they worked to find out what was Common among their Stories, they discovered that the Deepest and Highest elements of their stories were shared, and that the Deeper and Higher the element was, the more Universally and Eternally it applied. 

They progressively realized that they were interexisting within One Living System that co-operated according to a set of Universal and Eternal Principles and Patterns. 

The Highest and Deepest Principles, Patterns, and Values showed up over and over again throughout the diverse array of [[Special Case]] individual and local instances. 

They discovered that the Personalities reflected in their stories arrayed themselves around a diverse-yet-finite set of [[Archetypes]]. The [[Archetypes]] were like [[Ideals]] that defined [[The Essence]] of a [[Category]]. 

They discovered that the Personalities in their stories were motivated by a set of [[Goals]] and [[Values]] that were shared at the Highest and Deepest levels. 

And they discovered that the Experiences reflected in their stories arrayed themselves around a set of [[Principles]] and [[Patterns]] that revealed the Nature of Society and the Living System. 

The more they articulated and listened to their Stories, the more they came to understand [[The Story]] of the interexistence of humanity and All Creation aboard [[Vessel Earth]]. 

They discovered that Experiences in their stories could be grouped into [[Categories]], that [[The Essence]] of what the stories in a category shared was something like an [[Archetype]] or [[Ideal]], and that the total set of [[Principles]], [[Values]], [[Patterns]], [[Archetypes]], and [[Ideals]] seemed to be interexisting in [[One]] Coherent and Intelligible [[Narrative Universe]]. 

The Deeper they came to understand [[The Story]], the more they came to understand that they were not alone. For generations, they had felt isolated. They had been told it was [[Us vs. Them]]. They had assumed that they were the only ones who were suffering in these ways. They had assumed they were the only ones who harbored these deep fears and desires. They had assumed they were the only ones who longed for a [[Better World]]. 

However as they shared, and as they listened, they realized that they were profoundly united not only by their Divine Origin, by also by the Deepest shared patterns of their experiences, longings, hopes, and fears. And beyond this, as [[The Story]] further illuminated the [[Meta Crisis]], it became clear that humanity also shared a Destiny; they would either succeed or fail together as one. 

The Image of [[The Story]] grew more beautiful and clear day by day, as more and more individuals, families, tribes, and nations awakened, shared, listened, and wove [[The Tapestry]] back together. 

As [[The Story]] illuminated [[The Narrative Universe]] big enough to encompass and unite them [[All]], it became easier and easier to orient, navigate, and move together. 

### Epiphany Five: One Highest Identity 

One of the most profound realizations that emerged from [[The Story]] related to [[Identity]]. 

As [[The Narrative Universe]] unveiled itself, they realized that after generations enslaved in [[The Caves]], they had forgotten Who They Were. 

One of the main features of [[The Game of Empire and Oligarchy]] played by the [[Keepers of The Caves]] was [[Divide and Conquer]]. Part of the logic was to Keep Divided To Keep Conquered. 

The two main tools of [[Divide and Conquer]] were [[Fear]] and [[Identity]], and they worked together. The Wolves would divide the sheep up into groups, categorize and name them, and pit them against one another. The more [[Fear]] they could sow along the lines of [[Us vs. Them]], the stronger the [[Hatred]] and [[Division]] between the groups grew. 

The stronger the fear, hatred, and division between groups grew, the more they dissociated from [[One Another]] and That Which They Shared In Common, and the more the Identified with their differences. 

Over the generations, this had resulted in the primary [[Identity]] of humanity shifting further and further away from [[Unity]], and growing more and more polarized and divided along a vast array of fractures and fault lines. 

As [[The Story]] came back together, so too did the memories of humanity about Who They Were. They remembered that [[In The Beginning]], [[One]]. They remembered that spiritually, biologically, psychologically, and practically, at the Highest and Deepest levels of analysis, they were [[All]] [[One Family]].  

One [[Family of Families]]. One [[Tribe Of Tribes]]. One [[Nation of Nations]]. 

As they looked back towards the [[Highest]] and [[Deepest]] thing they [[All]] shared in common, the [[One Thing]] that United the vast [[Diversity]], it always and inevitably came back to the [[One]]. [[God]]. [[Creator]]. The Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End. The Source and Sustainer. [[I Am]]. 

The remembrance of their [[One]] [[Highest Identity]] was a crucial turning point in [[The Story]]. The memory felt like coming home. 

The revelation of their [[One]] [[Highest Identity]] as [[One Family]] of [[God]] did not require that they abandon any of their other [[Lower Order]] Names. They had individual names. Team names. Local names. Bioregional names. Tribal names. Group names. Company names. National names. And they could keep them all. 

It was as if everyone who awakened was being simultaneously welcomed home and adopted by The Great Father back into [[One Family]]. They could all retain their individual and local names and affiliations, while joyfully taking back up their Highest [[New Name]] and the vast sovereignty, authority, and inheritance that was their as Children of The [[One]] King of Kings. 

### Epiphany Six: One Highest Citizenship 

As the remembrances of the [[New Story]] revealed to them their [[Highest Identity]] and [[New Name]], it became clear to them simultaneously that their [[Highest Citizenship]] was not in any of the [[SpatioTemporal]] Earthly tribes, kingdoms, or nations, but in the Universal and Eternal [[Kingdom of God]] that United [[All Creation]] as [[One]]. 

Like their [[Highest Identity]], being adopted back into their shared [[Highest Citizenship]] did not require that they cancel or revoke any of the lower order affiliations or citizenships they had previously attained. 

It only required that they joyfully take up the [[New]] and Higher Citizenship. 

Unlike the previous revolutions that pit [[Us vs. Them]] and destroyed the [[Old]] in order to bring forth the [[New]], this was not a revolution. It was a transcendence. 

As they [[Voluntarily]] adopted, and were adopted back into, a [[New]] and [[Highest Citizenship]], they discovered that the [[New Citizenship]] allowed them to retain the very best features of all that humanity had built over the millennia, while also affording the [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] required to partner with [[One]] and [[One Another]] to meet the needs and solve the problems at hand. 

It was as simple as voluntarily taking up a [[New Name]], and voluntarily beginning to act out a [[New Game]], together. 

### Epiphany Seven: One Highest Vision, Aim, and Goal 

[[The Story]] had revealed Who They Were, Where They Were, and How They Got There. The [[Backward Looking Story]] was nearly complete. 

As they began weaving their individual and local stories into a shared [[Forward Looking Story]], they discovered a treasure of immeasurable worth. 

With each individual and local thread woven, an [[Image]], or [[Vision]], began to appear. As the Vision grew ever more clear, the excitement rippled throughout [[The Movement]]. 

It turned out that at the [[Deepest]] and [[Highest]] level, they all longed for and desired the same [[Future]]. In their heart of hearts, they all shared the [[Vision]] of [[What Should Be]]. 

[[The Narrative Universe]] was composed of a diverse array of metaphors, prophesies, hopes, and warnings about the future. On one hand, there were warnings about ending up in places that approached [[Hell On Earth]], imprisoned in Darkness and Oppression for generations. Their ancestors had been warned about the [[Hell]] they were now awakening from, and had proceeded into it anyway. Yet on the other hand, there was a positive and hopeful [[Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] that permeated throughout the prophesies. It leapt off the pages, the Light of Heaven even brighter when contrasted against the Darkness of Hell. 

It was a [[Vision]] of [[Perfection]]. The [[Ideal]]. The way things should be. It was as if it were written by Love on the hearts of every being. 

From tribes around the world, the prophesies all pointed to a time when humanity would awaken from a time of deep Darkness, the young and the old would reembrace one another, the masculine and feminine would heal one another, the eagle and the condor would fly together, and from North, South, East and West, people from every tribe, nation and people would return to [[The Great Banquet Table]] at the top of the [[Sacred Mountain]] to rediscover the [[Way]] of the [[One]]. 

And it was prophesied that when the [[Knowledge of God]] covered the Earth like floodwaters, the lion would lie down with the lamb, they would beat their weapons into tools of life, and no longer would they train their children to war. 

Reunited as [[One Citizenship Under God]], there would be no room for factions, division, or war. [[United As One]], there would be no "them" to war with. 

Perhaps the most magical part of the [[Universal and Eternal]] [[Vision]] of [[Heaven On Earth]] was that it was not only perfect, but it continued to get [[A Little Better Every Day]] as [[All Creation]] worked together in [[Harmony]] to cause it to be so. 

And so it was that they rediscovered the [[Creator's Intent]] for [[Worksite Earth]], and adopted it as their one Highest Overarching and Uniting Vision, Aim, and Goal. 

All those who awakened and emerged from [[The Caves]] came to share a deep understanding of Where They Were Going, and [[Why]].  

[[The Promised Land]] beckoned. 

### Epiphany Eight: One Epic Quest Towards Destiny 

Another fascinating feature revealed by the [[Archetypical Narrative Structure]] was that across a vast array of unique local stories, [[The Promised Land]] was separated from [[The Caves]] (the place of slavery, darkness, oppression, and forgotten identity) by a vast [[Chasm]] or [[Wilderness]]. 

They also came to understand that [[The Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] Of Greatest Worth required that they [[Progress]] together along a [[Way]] marked by a series of [[Challenges]], [[Obstacles]], and [[Milestones]]. 

One of the final and most dreadful Challenges was the [[Existential Threat]] posed by [[The Giants]] who guarded [[The Promised Land]]. 

Based on the conditions of those in [[The Caves]], the realities of the [[Meta Crisis]], and the heart of [[Love]] that desired for none to suffer in slavery or perish in [[The Fire]], they patterned [[The Story]] after the idea of One human species aboard [[Vessel Earth]], traveling together through the generations on an epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]]. 

In this part of [[The Story]], the adventure required attempting to [[Move]] the entire human population, [[FROM the Old TO the New]], within a single generation. 

The Epic Quest Towards Destiny, towards [[The Goal]] of Greatest Worth, was already under [[Way]]. 

It was an invitation from [[One]] to [[All]], to progress back towards [[Unity]], [[Harmony]], and [[Abundance]] through [[Love]].  

### Epiphany Nine: One Universal War 



### Epiphany Ten: One Victory and Best Possible Future For All 





## VI. A New System, Strategy, and Plan 

Having recaptured [[The Plot]] of [[The Story]] and reunited around the [[Most Important Things]], it was time to embark on the Epic [[Quest]] towards [[Destiny]]. 

Moved by [[The Spirit]] and the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] of [[One]] for [[All]], and desiring that none should perish or be [[Left Behind]] in [[The Caves]], a system, strategy, and plan began to [[Emerge]] to move the entire population [[FROM the Old TO the New]].  

Out of [[The Caves]], beyond [[The Boundary]], through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Promised Land]]. 
### The Movement: FROM The Old TO The New 

By 2023, the awakening and arising [[Force For Good]] had come to agree on the broad outlines of a [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

They understood that to spark [[The Movement]] out of [[The Caves]], beyond the [[Meta Crisis]], and towards the [[Land Of Promise]], all they had to do to begin was whisper the Truth in order to ignite the [[Tipping Point Strategy]]. 
 
[[One]] and 1 could awaken 2.  
2 could awaken 3.  
3 could awaken 5.  
5 could awaken 8.  
8 could awaken 13.  
13 could awaken 21.  
21 could awaken 34.  
34 could awaken 55.  
55 could awaken 89.  
89 could awaken 144.  

144 could awaken 144,000.  

144,000 could awaken 3%. 

3% could awaken 70%.

70% could awaken [[All]].  

The strategy and plan for a [[Whisper Campaign]] to catalyze [[The Movement]] FROM the [[Old]] TO the [[New]] was forged. 

An early Milestone was established, to Move 3% Beyond The Boundary by 2026. 

There would be many later challenges and battles to confront and overcome as they ventured into the [[Unknown]], but for now the [[Next Steps]] were clear. 

Unbeknownst to the [[Old Authorities]], those who had first awakened and escaped from [[The Caves]] had left a series of [[Milestones]] that marked the [[Way]] towards [[The Boundary]], and beyond the Boundary, towards [[The Goal]]. 
### Awakening, Inspiring, and Inviting One By One

As the awakened whispered and moved together, those who were ready to awaken would hear and begin stirring. As the stirred, those already [[On The Path]] would hear the rustling of chains, attend to the awakening, and do whatever was required to inspire and breathe life and hope back into the individual. 

At the [[Wise Right]] Time, they would extend [[The Invitation]] to join [[The Movement]]. 

Upon accepting [[The Invitation]], the individual would be led through an [[Orientation and Onboarding Process]] to ensure they understood the rules of the [[New Game]], and knew how to follow the [[Milestones]] towards [[Freedom]]. 

To our astonishment and joy, it began working! As the awakened simply whispered and made their way towards The Boundary, those who were ready to hear heard.  

When they heard, they would partially awaken, cease chattering, and begin moving. 

As those making their way out of the [[Darkness]] of [[The Caves]] heard the rustling of chains from others who were awakening and beginning to Move, they would stop and liberate the newly awakened, orient them, set their feet [[On The Path]], and welcome them into the procession.  

It was like water when it pierces a dam. Just a few drops at first, sneaking their way through the smallest cracks. But once the first 1 made it out of The Caves, it was easier for the 2nd... and the 3rd... and the 5th... and the 8th... and the 13th... and the 55th... and the 144th... and the 144,000th...

It was a motley procession. Pale grey bodies, atrophied and weak on the outside but illuminated with strength and power by [[The Spirit]] rising within, began to stream past the Milestones that marked the [[Way]] beyond [[The Boundary]] and towards [[The Goal]]. It was immeasurably beautiful. We were rising. We would often have to stop and rest. When one stumbled, the others would steady her. When one fell, the others would lift him up.  

One by one, the movement had begun, and it was now only a matter of time until [[All]] who desired had awakened, arisen, united, and progressed [[FROM the Old TO the New]]. 
### Reestablishing Identity, Sovereignty, and Autonomy 

After generations in the slavery and oppression of [[The Caves]], one of the first steps in the [[Orientation and Onboarding Process]] was to help each [[Individual]] reestablish their Identity, Sovereignty, and Autonomy. 

This was not an easy or self-evident task. 

To formalize the [[Process]], each individual articulated a basic [[Identity]], [[Constitution]] and [[Field of Agreements]] to establish the boundaries of their first [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]]: their [[Self]]. 

The [[Identity]] helped them and others remember Who They Are. 

The [[Constitution]] reestablished their a priori [[Sovereignty]], [[Freedom]] and [[Independence]]. 

The [[Field of Agreements]] established the [[Rules]] by which they agreed to conduct their [[Self]]. 

Together, these documents formalized the first act of [[Self Governance]], reestablishing a Sovereign, [[Autonomous]] [[Conscious Agent]], liberated to move and advance towards [[The Goal]] of their own [[Free Will]] and [[Volition]]. 

### Entering The New Covenant 

For those who recognized that they could not advance beyond [[The Boundary]], through [[The Wilderness]], and towards [[The Goal]] in isolation, an Individual [[Constitution]] and [[Field of Agreements]] was not enough. 

Having regained their [[Sovereignty]] and [[Independence]], they would have to once again make voluntary sacrifices and agreements in order to gain the benefits of collaboration and mutual aid, and remain in [[Reciprocal]] [[Right Relationship]] with their fellow travelers. 

To establish the Highest Order of Unity, Spirit, and Intention among all individuals advancing towards [[The Goal]], the concept of the [[New Covenant]] was resurrected and brought to the fore. 

As opposed to the lower order transactional and temporary relationships that marked the [[Old World]], covenantal relationship spoke to the sacred, eternal Right Relationship between [[One]] and [[All]], between the [[Creator]] and [[All Creation]]. 

The [[New Covenant]], unlike the written laws and constitutions that governed the [[Old World]], was unwritten and mediated by [[The Spirit]]. 

It was a matter of Spirit, Intention, and Heart rather than mere compliance with the written word. 

Although it was unwritten, everyone knew what it meant and required, because it was written on the hearts of all people of [[Goodwill]]. 

The Spirit and Essence of it were reflected as closely as possible in what came to be known as the [[Lionsberg Constitution]]. 

The [[Lionsberg Constitution]] reflected and formalized the New and Higher Order Sovereignty and Citizenship that humanity was arising into, and established a [[Commons]] where infrastructure, resources, and support could be aggregated and stewarded in service of [[One]] and [[All]]. 

All individuals, as a first act of emerging out of isolation and into community, were invited to incorporate by reference the Lionsberg Constitution into their Individual Constitution, thereby formally agreeing to [[The Rules]] of the [[New Game]] and the [[New Covenant]] that enabled [[All Creation]] to advance together in [[Harmony]] towards [[The Goal]]. 
### Forging and Joining Groups 
After reestablishing Soveriegnty, Self Governance, and agreeing to [[The Rules]] of the [[New Game]], it was time to 


### Progressing as a Tribe of Tribes 



### Shared Infrastructure, Resources, and Support 



### Governance and Navigation 



### Co-Creating the Systems and Structures of the New World 



### Phases of Implementation 



### Measuring Progress



## VII. Confronting and Overcoming The Giants 

There will be a vast array of [[Challenges]] and [[Obstacles]] that mark the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]].  

Each will have to be forthrightly confronted and overcome in order to [[Progress]]. In fact, we might even say that our [[Progress]] will be directly proportional to our willingness to confront and overcome [[Obstacles]]. 

However one obstacle in particular requires some special attention. This is the Issue of [[The Giants]]. 


## VIII. A Vision of the World To Come 

## IX: Embarking on The Quest - Next Steps

## X: Tools For The Journey 


 

##### The Spiritual War

Over the millennia, this Spirit has been at war with an antithetical spirit characterized by the illusion of separation and self-supremacy. The [[Anti-Spirit]] rises up to assert its own supremacy and subordinate [[All]] things unto its false self through force. 

In incarnate form, the Spiritual War is most archetypically represented through the vision and prophesy of [[Christ]] and [[Anti-Christ]]. 

It is crucial to grasp there [[Archetypical]] concepts in the realm beyond religions forged by human hands and minds. Without doing soon, it is impossible to understand the Root Cause of the [[Meta Crisis]], and therefore impossible to confront and overcome it and realize [[The Solution]]. 

Here in [[SpaceTime]], the battle manifests itself in the way the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of each individual, family, tribe, nation, and power structure conducts the organism.

The [[Spiritual War]] is waged fractally within each domain, starting with the [[Individual]], and expanding up throughout the various aggregations of Individuals into tribes, nations, and [[Power Structures]]. 

##### Warring and Transforming Power Structures on Earth

Here on Earth, understanding the Spiritual War is essential to understanding that the Power Structures as we perceive them are not the real Power Structures. There is seldom any true power in the visible figurehead king, president, or prime minister. 

Behind the rise and fall of nations and empires, deeper and more persistent forces are at work, the [[Invisible Power Structures]] that control and often pit the [[Visible Power Structures]] against one another for their own narrow gain, and who continue to aggregate power in waves over successive generations of ascending and descending societal structures and public figureheads.

Looking behind the veil of the [[Visible Power Structures]], we come face to face with [[The Giants]]. 
##### The Ascendance of The Giants

As we gaze Beyond The Meta Crisis towards the [[Land Of Promise]] and the [[Collective Inheritance]] that beckons us forward, we are confronted by an army of Giants that stand in the [[Way]]. 

In [[The Story]], there are always Giants guarding the Land of Promise. One cannot simply waltz into the [[Best Possible Future]] and take up residence.
