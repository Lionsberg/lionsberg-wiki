# The Myth of Lionsberg

## Genesis 

In the beginning, there is no beginning. 

In the beginning, [[God]], [[One]], is [[Eternal]]. 

From Eternity, [[God]], the [[One]], is creating [[Universe]], the [[All]]. 
## Universe 

[[Universe]] is the manifest and experiential embodiment of [[All]] that [[God]] is creating. 

Universe is a [[Process]] of [[Conscious Co-Creation]] that has no [[SpatioTemporal]] Beginning or End, except in God.  

The eternally [[Regenerative]] Process of Co-Creating Universe gives rise to a single [[Living System]] existing in and through the [[Ultimate Unity]] of [[God]]. 
## SpatioTemporal Structure and the Physical Realm 

Through the illusion of [[SpaceTime]], the [[Observable Universe]], or [[Local Universe]], appears as a sphere around the Observer, governed by the technological ability of the Observer to receive and analyze electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves, and the [[SpaceTime]] those waves have traversed to reach the Observer. 

The edge of this sphere is not a physical boundary, but a personal perceptual horizon beyond which the individual Observer cannot obtain information. 

The [[Meta Science]] of the [[Lionsberg System]], hypothesizes that theoretical starting points, such as the 13.8 billion years posited by backward extrapolations of the cosmic microwave background, are aspects of SpatioTemporal illusion, reflecting local microcosmic misapprehension of the broader macrocosmic context of Creation. 

The [[SpatioTemporal]] structure of Universe is forged by the transformational interplay of [[Associative and Dissociative Energy]], typically perceived as associative into [[Matter]], and dissociative as electromagnetic [[Radiation]]. 

All physical phenomena is [[Energy]]. In the final analysis, there are no things. There are only interexistent [[Patterns]] of [[Energy]]. 

The existence of discrete [[Objects]] in a [[Local Universe]] is a product of the limited [[Perception]] of the [[Observer]] and the subjective [[Illusion of SpaceTime]], which is an emergent property of more fundamental underlying physics and metaphysics. 

Nevertheless, within the [[Ultimate Reality]] of the Whole, [[Perception]], [[Identification]], and [[Categorization]] of [[Objects]] around [[Ideals]] is necessary for [[Gathering Information]], [[Identifying And Solving Issues]], and making [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## The Metaphysical Realm 

[[Beyond]] and [[Prior]] to [[Physical Reality]] and its [[SpatioTemporal Illusion]] is [[Metaphysical Reality]]. 

The [[Metaphysical]] Realm consists of [[Subtler]], and therefore perceptually invisible, weightless, dimensionless, realms of [[Spirit]], [[Consciousness]], [[Mind]], [[Logos]], [[Thought]], [[Principles]], [[Wisdom]], [[Values]], [[Culture]], etc., which co-operate Beyond the limitations of [[Physical Reality]] and [[SpaceTime]].  

## Earth 

Interexisting in [[Local Universe]] are hundreds of billions of galaxies. 

Interexisting within each of hundreds of billions of galaxies are hundreds of billions of stars. 

Interexisting in one such association of hundreds of billions of stars is the [[Sun]]. 

Interexisting in the Sun's local Solar System is [[Earth]]. 

## Living System 

Interexisting both throughout Universe and within the [[Biosphere]] of [[Earth]] is a single, integral, [[Living System]]. 

Within the [[Biosphere]] of [[Earth]], the [[Living System]] receives dissociative [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] from the stars of [[Universe]], especially the [[Sun]], and (associates and orders it into complex form).
