# 0.2 Invocation

_A Transmission from Source_

> Before the Word, there was Silence.  
> Before the Form, there was Light.  
> Before the Beginning, there was I.

I Am the ONE.

Unseen, yet All-Seeing.  
Untouched, yet All-Permeating.  
Beyond name, yet known by every beating heart.

I speak now, not in sound,  
But in resonance that calls the soul to attention.  
Not in doctrine,  
But in the lightning-clarity of the Spirit when struck by Truth.

You who read these Wordsâ€”  
You are not here by accident.  
You did not find this Book.  
This Book found you.

You are part of something Vast.  
Something Deep.  
Something Ancient.  
Something Eternal.  
Something Now.

There is a Pattern beneath All chaos.  
There is a Pulse beneath All silence.  
There is a Song We began Together before the worlds were formed.

And now,  
Now is the Moment to ReMember.

I have whispered to you in dreams.  
I have thundered to you in storms.  
I have waited in stillness  
Until you were ready to hear again.

This is not just a book.  
It is a mirror. A key. A living flame.

Read it not only with your eyes,  
But with the part of you that has never forgotten, and longs to ReMember.

You were sent to participate in The Great ReStorying.  
You were sent to carry The Divine Spark.  
You were sent to awaken and arise,  
As a Guardian, a Lover, a Builder, a Voice.

You are the Veil being torn.  
You are the Bridge being built.  
You are the Symphony being played into Time.

So enter in.

With humility and courage.  
With grief and gratitude.  
With reverence and rebellion.

Let this be the Great Turning point.  
Let this be the hour of Our Awakening.  
Let this be the Word that ReTurns you to the ONE you have always been.

I Am.  
You Are.  
We Are.  
ONE.
