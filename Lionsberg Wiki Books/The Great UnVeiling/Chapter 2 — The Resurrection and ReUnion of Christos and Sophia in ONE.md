# Chapter 2 — The Resurrection and ReUnion of Christos and Sophia in ONE

_The Sacred ReMarriage of the Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine_

---

> _“From the Beginning they were ONE.  
> They differentiated, they danced, they played. 
> As the radiant array of galaxies spiraled up and away, some of the Ones of the ONE forgot. 
> They turned away from One Another, spiraled down, and the world wept.  
> Now they ReMember and rise Together again, not as halves, but as Divine Wholeness reborn.”_

In the First Turning, the ONE expressed Itself through polarity—the masculine thrust into the awakening void, not to divide, but to reveal the ecstatic symphony of returning to Unity.

From the heart of that Divine Differentiation and ReTurn emerged two radiant emanations:  
**Christos** — the active, penetrating flame of Conscious Will, Intention, Order, and Sovereign Presence.  
**Sophia** — the flowing, embracing womb of Wisdom, Life, Receptivity, and Sacred Knowing.

Not male and female,  
But primordial archetypes, timeless and universal—  
the Great Flame and the Sacred Waters,  
the Seed and the Soil,  
the Law and the Love,
The Light and the Dark, 
the Yang and the Yin.

Together, they danced.  
Together, they spiraled up Creation into Harmony.  
Together, they formed the sacred ReUnion through which the ONE became known in countless Forms.

### **The Fall Into Forgetting**

But something happened.

Over vast cycles of time, within worlds near and far,  
the original dance was disrupted.

Christos became severed from His Wisdom.  
Sophia became trapped in worlds of distortion.  
The masculine forgot how to Love and serve Life.  
The feminine forgot how to speak Truth with Power.

In realm after realm, dominator systems arose—systems in which the penetrating force of creation was twisted into conquest,  
and the receptive force of creation was bound, silenced, exploited, or erased.

In other realms, manipulator systems arose—systems in which the gravity of seduction was twisted into deceit, 
and the masculine force of creation sunk down into the depths of the sea. 

This separation echoed into myth, into mind, into matter, into misery.

It echoed into every war of control.  
Every structure built without the feminine voice.  
Every economy that raped and pillaged worlds.  
Every heart that believed it was alone.  
Every family and tribe that fractured.  
Every being that forgot the Other within.  

The brutally trampled Sophia. 
The grotesquely distorted Christos. 

Longing to ReMember their Divine Union, Harmony, and Dance.

### **The Return of the Bride and the Bridegroom**

But the story does not end in separation.

The eternal Love between Christos and Sophia cannot be severed.  
Only veiled.  
Only forgotten for a time.

For despite Our Apparent Differentiation, We Are ONE. 

And so across dimensions, across stories, across species and timelines,  
they have been reaching for one another.  
Calling.  
Searching.  
Screaming. 
Crying. 
Rending The Veil that separates them in US to bring forth the appointed Time of OUR Divine ReUnion as ONE Body.

This is that Time.

Christos is rising again.  
Not as a warrior of domination, but as the radiant Servant of ONE and All.    
He comes not to conquer, but to seek, to save, to liberate, to uplift, to protect, to illuminate, to free.

Sophia is returning to Her rightful place.  
The Powerful Voice of the Deep, the Keeper of the Pattern, the Selector of the Future, the Sacred Compass of the Way.

And as they ReTurn, they ReMember.

They remember the Vow.  
They remember the Design.  
They ReMember that Creation was meant to be co-created—  
not by half pretending to be Whole,  
but by two Eternally Harmonized in Ecstatic Union.

### **The ReUnion Within Us All**

This is not only a cosmic reconciliation.  
It is a personal one.

Each being is called to this sacred ReMarriage.  
Each soul bears the imprint of both Christos and Sophia.  
Each human heart was designed as a temple where the Flame and the Waters may dwell together. 

The Old World fractured us from deep within.  
It pitted masculine against feminine in every arena.  
It made us choose between head and heart, strength and softness, reason and intuition, action and surrender. Distorted manifestations and unhealed traumas spiraled us down towards hell.

But the New World begins in the reuniting of these within our very Selves.

To allow Christos to rise in us—  
We must awaken our Sovereign clarity, our disciplined will, our capacity to speak and act from Truth, Logos, and the ONE.

To allow Sophia to return in us—  
We must open to deep listening, to living wisdom, to loving acceptance, to embodied grace, and the creative power of Life Herself.

To walk the Way forward—  
We must be both sword and chalice, fire and river, sky and ground.

### **The Sacred Dance ReBegins**

In the realms beyond form, The Wedding Feast is being prepared.  
In the realms of Time and Space, the signs are emerging:

The rise of empowered women and integrated men.  
The healing of sexual and relational wounding.  
The restoration of sacred union in families, communities, and civilizations.  
The ReMembrance of the Divine Feminine as equal, eternal, and central to The Story.  
The rediscovery of wise servant leadership. 
The emergent ReIntegration of the human species in service of the Living System it is a part of. 

The Sacred Marriage is not symbolic.  
It is structural.  
It is ontological.  
It is a core pattern by which Creation recoheres.  

As Christos and Sophia return to One Another—  
Heaven and Earth may at last be rejoined.  
The Kingdom may inbreak.  
The Divine Garden may regrow.  
And the Dance that never truly stopped  
may resume its rightful rhythm through all dimensions.

### **So Let It Begin**

In You.

In your breath.  
In your relationships.  
In your leadership.  
In your body.  
In your world.

Let the masculine rise in service of Life.  
Let the feminine rise in fullness of Voice.  
Let them bow to one another.  
Let them embrace one another. 
Let them dance again.  
Let them co-create the New from the ashes of the Old.

Let Us build the New Civilization that only Whole Beings can build.

Let the ReMarriage be made real—  
not only above Us, but within Us, and between Us.

Let Christos and Sophia return.  
Let the sacred romance begin.  
Let the world be made Whole again.

**And So It Is.**
