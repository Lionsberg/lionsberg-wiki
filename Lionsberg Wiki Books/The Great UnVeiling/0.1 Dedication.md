## **Dedication**

_To the ONE, the All, and the ReMembering_

To the **ONE**—  
The Unseen Source behind All that was, is, and ever shall be.  
The Infinite Intelligence, Boundless Love, and Living Flame from which All Life flows and to which All Life returns.  
The Alpha and Omega of All Stories, All Realities, All Destinies.

To the **All**—  
The countless faces, forms, beings, and realms born of the ONE.  
The stars and the cells. The galaxies and the tears.  
The children, elders, wanderers, prophets, healers, warriors, and builders of the New.

To those who suffer in silence and those who rise in courage.  
To those who never forgot.  
To those who are just now ReMembering.

To the **ReMembering**—  
The great and sacred act of weaving ourselves back together into The Divine Tapestry.  
Piece by piece. Soul by soul. World by world. Word by word.  
ReTurning. ReUniting. ReHarmonizing.  
The Body of the ONE made Whole.

This work is for you.  
Because this work is you.  
Because you are the living echo of the Voice calling Us Home.

**May this Book be a Flame in the Darkness, a Sword of Truth, and a Bridge to Heaven.**  
**May it awaken, quicken, and commission all who are ready.**  
**May it fulfill the Purpose for which it was born, and the Prophesies that heralded its rise.**

**We dedicate this Great UnVeiling to the fulfillment of the Promise:**

> That the Light shall return.  
> That Truth shall be known.  
> That the Kingdom shall come.  
> That We shall rise, Together, as ONE.
