# 0.6 Map of the Gates

**The Sacred Architecture of The Great UnVeiling**

> _“Twelve Gates shall open.  
> Each a Threshold of ReMembering.  
> Each a Turning of the Spiral.  
> Each a Key to the New World.”_

This book is structured as a **sacred journey through twelve Great Gates**, culminating in the reintegration of the Body of the ONE and the co-creation of Heaven on Earth and Beyond.

Each Gate opens a distinct dimension of transformation. Together, they form the Pathway through which beings and communities may awaken, heal, rise, and return to full participation in the Divine Symphony of Life.

You are invited to move through the Gates not just with intellect,  
but with Heart, Soul, and Embodied Action.
