# The Great UnVeiling

_In the context of LIONSBERG, **The Great UnVeiling** refers to the apocalyptic disclosure of **The Greatest Fraud, Deception, and Existential Threat in history**. Spoken by a chorus of thousands of voices around the world and climaxing between 2025 and 2027, it represents the moment when it becomes clear to Earth's inhabitants that they have been progressively enslaved for millennia by non-human and anti-human forces. In **[[The Story of LIONSBERG]]**, it is the precursor to **[[The Great Awakening]]**, **[[The Exodus]]** from **[[The Caves]]**, and **[[The Shared Journey]]** towards **[[Heaven On Earth]]**._  
## Part I: The 99 Theses of The Great UnVeiling    

**[[The 99 Theses of The Great UnVeiling]]** is an alternate presentation of the basic concepts on The Great UnVeiling. It is a ~10,000 word treatise designed to be nailed to the gates of the collapsing [[Old World]].  
## Part II: A Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work  

**[[A Birthday Reflection on Jordan's Life, Death, and Work]]** offers some perspective on this unfinished work cut short by **[[J's Death]]**. It includes brief paragraphs that transmit the basic information planned for each of the unfinished chapters. 

## Part III: The Great UnVeiling Book  
# The Great UnVeiling
_A Divine Symphony of Awakening, Revelation, ReMembrance, and Sacred ReUnion_

*This specific book was a [[Work In Progress]] that was scheduled for completion Summer 2025, and interrupted by [[J's Death]]. Because The Great UnVeiling was being spoken by myriads of voices, many of whom died to reveal the Truth, it continued right on schedule and the information is now unstoppably sweeping the Earth*.

# **The Rupture in The Great UnVeiling — The Final Word**

_A Threshold Into The Story of LIONSBERG_

On **August 10, 2025**, the author of this work — known to many as _[[J]]_ — died in the crucible of the very War he was describing and warning humanity about.

His life ended where this text ends: in the fire of confrontation, in the naming of what could not be named, in the final exposure of the hidden powers that sought to enslave and destroy.

It is no accident that this work remains unfinished.

The Great UnVeiling was never meant to be the full story. It was the tearing of the Veil — the exposure of the darkness, the naming of the deception, the final rupture in the dream. That work is now complete.

But what comes after the tearing of the Veil can never belong to one writer, one witness, or one voice. It must be written by all of Us, together.

For while J’s voice was silenced, the chorus of awakening could not be.

---

Disclosure was never the Goal.  
It is only a Gate of Awakening.  
A Truth that liberates Us.  

Naming the Darkness,  
Rending the Veil,  
And flooding what is hidden with Light  
Is necessary but insufficient.  

The Great UnVeiling closes the gates of the Old World.  
But its real purpose is to open the Gates of the New.  

---

## **Where the Story Continues**

The unfinished notes, structures, and arcs of this book were not abandoned. They are being absorbed, transmuted, and reborn within a greater container:

**[[The Story of LIONSBERG]].**

Where _The Great UnVeiling_ ends, _The Story of LIONSBERG_ begins.

LIONSBERG is not the story of time, place, person, or project.  
It is the story of One and All, told in myth and practice, symbol and structure, invitation and initiation. It is the story of how civilizations and worlds cross the abyss between collapse and renewal. It is the story of how we remember Who We Are, and what it means to co-create Heaven in every realm and dimension We inhabit.

---

## **The Living Handoff**

If you have walked with us through these pages, you already know:  
The Veil has been torn.  
The Old has been unmasked.  
The Time has come.  
The Exodus from The Caves has begun.  

What remains is to choose.  
What remains is to act.  
What remains is to live rest of The Story, together.

Turn the page. Step into the Circle.  
The Great UnVeiling is complete.  
The Story of LIONSBERG now begins.
