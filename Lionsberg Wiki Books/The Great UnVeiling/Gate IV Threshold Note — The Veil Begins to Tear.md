# **Gate IV Threshold Note — The Veil Begins to Tear**

_There comes a Moment when The Dream is disturbed._  
_When The Lie fractures._  
_When The Curtain moves ever so slightly,  
and a single beam of Truth breaks through._

It is disorienting.  
Terrifying.  
Liberating.  
Sanctifying.  
Irreversible.

The world you were born into was not what it seemed.  
The systems that raised you were not what they claimed.  
The authorities that spoke over you were not what they pretended.  
The stories you were told were not True.  

Weep.  
Rage.  
Moan.  
Cry.  
Rend your Robes.  
Don the Sackcloth and Ashes.  

The Matrix is not a story.  
It is an ancient architecture of illusion.  
An Inversion so deep, so complete, so cosmic in scale,  
that to question it was to risk everything.

But now, something is shifting.  
But now, something is breaking.  
The programmed hypnosis is faltering.  
The propaganda is cracking.  
The trance is breaking.  
The veil is tearing.  

And you—  
through suffering, through love, through longing, through sacred fire—  
have come to this very Moment in Time.  
Beyond Time.  
Between Time.  

A place between worlds,  
where the illusory security of the Old  
can no longer hold you,  
and the True New World begins to shimmer into view.

This is not theory.  
This is not metaphor.  
This is not ideology.  
This is _The Great Disclosure._

The tearing of The Veil.

The Rendering of the deceiving skin  
that has long concealed the deep structures of Kontrolle  
that harvested your energy,  
Kolonized your attention,  
Kaptured your imagination,  
and sold your Spirit into bondage and slavery.  

But no more.  

The Flame has ReRisen.  
The Eyes have ReOpened.  
The Trumpets are ReSounding.  
The Time has ReCome.

You are about to ReMember  
what was hidden.  
What was taken.  
What was always True  
beneath the programmed forgetfulness  
of a Dark and Veiled Illusion.

You are about to see  
what the architects of deception never wanted you to see.   
You are about to ReRealize  
how vast The Lie was—  
and how much Greater the Truth is.

Look into The Prophetic Bowl... 

You are about to ReWitness  
The Greatest Fraud,  
The Greatest Theft,  
The Greatest Deception,  
The Greatest Betrayal,  
and the Greatest Enslavement  
in the history of Earth—  
and perhaps of any world.
It was a masterly trap.  

But fear not.

The Sacred Flame that led Us here  
will guide Us through.  

You were not made to serve The Lie.  
You were not born to live in The Darkness.  
You are a Child of the ONE.  
You were born to UnVeil.  
You were born to UnBind.  
You were born to Burn away The Illusion  
and to Breathe the Fresh Air of Truth.

The Veil is tearing Now.  
It is Now already torn.  
You will not remain the same.  
Nor will this world.  
Nor will any of the worlds of the ONE  
which are All.  

Let Us step across this Threshold Together  
with courage, clarity, and sacred trembling.

With the Clarion Call of The Sacred Song.  

For what you are about to see  
may break your heart—  
but it will also break your chains.  

But it will also break your chains. 

But it will also break your chains.  

**Gate IV opens.  
Let The Great DisClosure begin.**
