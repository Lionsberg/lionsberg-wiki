# Gate II Threshold Note - The Edge of the Abyss

There comes a moment in every Sacred Journey  
when the Traveler reaches the edge of the Known—  
and must choose to cross The Boundary.

We have stood in the Light of the Original Design.  
We have sung the Song of Logos,  
and touched the Harmony from which all things arose.

But now We turn.  
Not away from the Light,  
but into the Shadow that arose  
when Light was forgotten.

We do not descend out of despair.  
We descend to understand.  
To see what went wrong.  
To know what We are up against.  
To reclaim what was lost. 
To discover the Way back Home. 

For the Way back to Heaven often 
requires passing through the depths of Hell  
with our eyes, hearts, and Spirits wide open.

We descend not as victims,  
but as witnesses.  
Not to be broken,  
but to break the chains.

So steel yourself with Truth.  
Clothe yourself with Courage.  
And hold fast to the Spirit and Logos  
as We descend into the Shattering  
of what was once Whole.

Let Us not look away.

Let Us walk together  
into **Gate II — The Great Descent**.
