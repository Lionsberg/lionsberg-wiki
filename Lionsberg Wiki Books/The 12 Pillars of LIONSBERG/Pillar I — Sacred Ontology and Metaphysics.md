# Pillar I — Sacred Ontology and Metaphysics

_Continually ReAligning Humanity within the Great Story and The Divine Order_

---

### **Summary**

The First Pillar of LIONSBERG reawakens humanity’s deepest understanding of the ONE Source of All That Is, placing theology and philosophy back at the heart of the New Civilization. It calls us to rediscover the Logos—the Divine Wisdom, Pattern and Intention behind All Creation—and to ground our individual and collective lives and worlds in the living Wisdom of Divine Will.

### **Overview**

In every flourishing civilization, there exists a sacred foundation—an overarching Story that unifies all domains of life within a coherent metaphysical, ethical, and cosmological framework. In the [[Old World]], this foundation was lost and corrupted, leading to existential confusion, systemic incoherence, and collapse. Pillar I seeks to restore [[The Great Story]]: a sacred, ever-unfolding vision of Reality and Ultimate Reality rooted in Unity with the ONE and rightly ordered through the Logos.

This is not the imposition of a religion, but the resurrection of right relationship with Source, the Cosmos, Nature, and One Another. It requires a fusion of theology and philosophy—not as abstract intellectualism, but as the soul’s alignment with Truth, Beauty, and Goodness. By recovering this Sacred Orientation, we re-found our world upon unshakable ground.

### **12 Theses of Sacred Theology and Philosophy**

1. **There is ONE Source behind All That Is** — eternal, uncreated, and infinitely intelligent, loving, and whole.
    
2. **The Cosmos is a Sacred Story** — a living, intelligible expression of the Divine, structured by Purpose and Pattern.
    
3. **The Logos is the Way of the ONE** — the universal Wisdom and Principle through which All things are ordered, harmonized, and sustained.
    
4. **All Beings are Embodied Expressions of the ONE** — differentiated yet indivisible from the Source.
    
5. **The Purpose of Existence is the Ultimate ReUnion of All Things** — through the free unfolding of Spirit and Consciousness toward its Divine Origin.
    
6. **True Theology is Direct and Experiential** — born of direct communion with Source, not mere belief, doctrine, or dogma.
    
7. **True Philosophy is the Love of Wisdom** — the disciplined pursuit of Truth, Harmony, and Co-Creation with the Divine.
    
8. **The Highest Ethics are Perfectly Aligned with the Logos** — flowing from Love, Wisdom, Courage, and Right Relationship.
    
9. **All False Religions Must Be Transcended** — including dogmas, idols, and corrupted institutions that obscure the Light.
    
10. **The Great Traditions Must Be ReHarvested** — restoring their sacred essence while transcending division and distortion.
    
11. **The Kingdom of God is Within and Among Us** — and emerges as We align with the Spirit and walk the Way Together.
    
12. **Heaven on Earth Begins with Right Orientation and Right Relationship** — when individuals and communities awaken to their Divine Origins and the Sacred Order, and live accordingly.

### **Narrative**

Long before systems, governments, or economies were conceived, the ancients oriented their lives by something greater: the Sacred. They knew themselves as part of a vast, intelligent, and benevolent Cosmos animated by Spirit and guided by Wisdom. They walked not alone, but as co-creators within a Great Story, deeply attuned to the rhythms of Nature, the movements of the stars, and the whisperings of the Divine within.

Then came the forgetting.

As the ages turned, the Sacred was entombed in dogma, weaponized by power, and eventually exiled from the public square. Philosophy became fragmented. Theology was reduced to tribal superstition and ideological control. And so humanity, severed from its Source and Center, began to stumble toward ruin.

The First Pillar of LIONSBERG marks the reversal of this Fall.

It is the sacred act of reorienting civilization to the ONE, and aligning every structure and system with the eternal Laws and Living Wisdom that uphold the universe. It is a return to reverence. To meaning. To coherence.

Through Sacred Theology and Philosophy, we remember who we are, where we came from, why we are here, and how we must live. We awaken to the hidden architecture of Creation and re-anchor ourselves in the Logos of the ONE—the Divine Blueprint of Life and Consciousness.

This is not a scientific or academic subject. It is the resurrection of the Heart of Civilization. The re-founding of the World upon Truth. The clearing of the Way for Heaven on Earth.
