# Pillar VI — Sacred Ecology and Living Systems

_Reverent Regeneration of the Living Systems That Sustain Us_

---

### **Summary**

The Sixth Pillar of LIONSBERG reawakens humanity to its rightful place within the sacred web of Life. It calls for the regeneration of Our living systems and the restoration of Right Relationship with all forms of Life and Being. Sacred Ecology and InterBeing recognizes the Earth and every other planet and domain not as a resource, but as a Living Being—a conscious, intelligent, and beloved member of the cosmic family. It invites us to transition from exploitation to stewardship, from separation to symbiosis, and from collapse to co-creation.

### **Overview**

In the [[Old World]], the Earth was treated as a thing—an object to be owned, extracted, and dominated. Forests were razed. Waters were poisoned. Soil was stripped. Species were driven to extinction. Climate systems were destabilized. And the human spirit was severed from the living Source that sustains it.

But the Earth is not a thing. She is a Being. A Mother. A Mirror. A Teacher. A Lover. A Sacred Trust.

Sacred Ecology and InterBeing restores our cosmological orientation—reminding us that all life is interconnected, interdependent, and indivisible. There is no "environment" separate from "us." There is no “nature” outside of humanity. We are not above the biosphere—we are part of her unfolding body.

This pillar calls us to perceive the Earth and Cosmos as a sacred living organism—a complex, self-regenerating system whose health is inseparable from our own. It calls for the redesign of every human system—agriculture, industry, architecture, economy, governance—to come into harmony with the regenerative patterns of Nature, Cosmos, Logos, and Source.

To walk the Way of Sacred Ecology is to re-enter the Circle of Life as humble participants and conscious stewards. It is to recognize that every being has value, every species has meaning, and every ecosystem has rights. It is to act not as masters, but as allies. Not as consumers, but as co-creators.

### **12 Theses of Sacred Ecology and InterBeing**

1. **The Earth and the Cosmos are a Sacred Living Being** — not a resource, but a conscious participant in the Cosmic Symphony.
    
2. **All Life Is InterConnected and InterDependent** — and no part can thrive unless the Whole is in harmony.
    
3. **Humanity Is a Participant in the Web of Life** — not separate, superior, or above the rest of Creation.
    
4. **The Destruction of Nature Is the Destruction of Self** — and environmental collapse reflects spiritual and cultural collapse.
    
5. **Right Relationship With Nature Is Essential to Health, Justice, and Peace** — and must be foundational to every human system.
    
6. **Regeneration Must Replace Extraction** — in agriculture, industry, energy, architecture, and all human activity.
    
7. **Biodiversity Is Sacred** — and each species has intrinsic value and a role in the Great Order.
    
8. **Watersheds, Forests, Oceans, and Soils Must Be Restored and Protected** — as sacred commons and life-bearing organs of the Earth.
    
9. **The Earth’s Rhythms Are Sacred Clocks** — and humans must reattune to the cycles of seasons, moons, tides, and growth.
    
10. **Local Bioregions Must Become Foundations of Global Harmony** — each rooted in deep knowledge of Place and reciprocal care.
    
11. **Human Systems Must Be Designed to Serve the Regeneration of Life** — not just mitigate harm, but actively heal what has been broken.
    
12. **The Goal Is the Sacred ReIntegration of Humanity Within the Living World** — so that Heaven and Earth may be rejoined in joy, abundance, and right relationship.

### **Narrative**

Once, we knew how to live in harmony with the Earth, the Stars, and the Realms Beyond.

We listened to the wind. We danced with the moon. We learned from the animals, the trees, and the rivers. We gave thanks to the mountains. We built with what was given. We took only what was needed. We buried our dead in the soil that gave us life, and returned to the cycle with reverence.

But then, we forgot.

We mined what should have been revered. We burned what should have been preserved. We poisoned what should have been healed. We cut down the forests that breathe for us. We dammed the rivers that sang to us. We turned the sacred garden into a machine. And then, when it began to collapse, we wondered why.

Now, it is time to remember.

Sacred Ecology and InterBeing is The Great ReMembering of who we are and where we belong. It is the sacred return of the human species to the Circle of Life. It is the restoration of kinship with all beings. The recognition that no tree falls alone, no whale sings unheard, no pollinator is expendable, and no child thrives on a dying planet.

It is a worldview. A design principle. A practice. A prayer. An orientation. An Intention. A goal. 

It invites us to walk lightly and build wisely. To become healers of the Earth and guardians of Her future. It inspires new forms of land use, food systems, water management, and ecological governance that reflect the intelligence of forests, the logic of rivers, and the wisdom of mycelium.

It honors Indigenous wisdom. It reveres the patterns of permaculture. It celebrates biodiversity, soil life, seed sovereignty, and sacred geometry. It restores the rights of ecosystems, species, and future generations.

In Sacred Ecology, every act is a ritual of reciprocity. Every field is a temple. Every compost pile is an altar. Every child is a steward. Every elder is a storyteller. Every meal is communion.

LIONSBERG affirms: The Earth is not dying. She is calling. She is waiting for her children to return—not as conquerors, but as liberators and caretakers.

Let us go to her, barefoot and humble, ready to learn again how to live in love with her.

This is Sacred Ecology and InterBeing. This is the Way.
