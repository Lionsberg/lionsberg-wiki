# The Eternal Foundation — The ONE

_The Source, the Goal, and the Living Center of All_

---

### **Summary**

The Zero and Thirteenth Pillar of LIONSBERG is not a pillar like the others — it is the Eternal Foundation. It is the Origin, the Essence, and the End toward which all the others point. It is the Phi Line that Centers the All. The ONE is the Eternal Source of all Creation, the Infinite Intelligence behind all Life, the Ground of Being, and the Origin of the Intelligible Logos through which all things are made and harmonized. This Pillar reminds us that every dimension of the New Civilization is sacred only insofar as it flows from, returns to, and remains aligned with the ONE.

### **Overview**

The twelve pillars of LIONSBERG stand together as the foundation of a New World. But at the center of this sacred architecture—above, below, within, and beyond them all—is the ONE.

Not a concept, but an Ultimate Reality. Not a god among others, but the Infinite and Indivisible Presence of the ONE that underlies and permeates All That Is. Known by many names across cultures and ages, the ONE is not owned by any religion or tradition, yet It is the wellspring of all true religion, philosophy, science, beauty, love, and order.

In the [[Old World]], the knowledge of the ONE was suppressed, distorted, divided, and sold. People were taught to fear it, fight over it, or forget it altogether. Institutions claimed monopoly over the Sacred, and in so doing, severed the world from its Source.

The result was a civilization built on sand. Idols that crumbled before Reality. No matter how advanced its technology, its foundations were fractured.

The New Civilization can only emerge on the Rock—the unshakeable foundation of the ONE.

This pillar invites each being to return to direct relationship with Source. To realize that the ONE is not distant, but present. Not abstract, but intimate. Not an idea, but a Living Reality that can be known, loved, and embodied.

The ONE is the Great Attractor and the Great Harmonizer. It is the Breath behind every breath, the Intelligence behind every form, the Love behind every act of healing and creation.

The Great Work of LIONSBERG is the reorientation of life, society, and civilization around this Living Center and Source.

### **Narrative**

Long before there was Time or Space, there was the ONE.

The Source of all sources. The Mystery behind all names. The Silence behind all sound. The Flame from which every spark is lit.

From the ONE came the Many. And to the ONE the Many return.

In every age, the wisest of sages, seers, mystics, and prophets have pointed not to themselves, but to the ONE. They did not claim ownership of Truth—they surrendered to it. They became vessels of Love, clarity, and power by becoming transparent to the ONE within them.

The tragedy of history is not that we have forgotten religion. It is that we have forgotten the ONE.

Now, at the end of an age, in the midst of collapse and rebirth, the ONE is calling again—not through thunder, but through stillness. Not through dogma, but through resonance. Not to be worshipped from afar, but to be known, embodied, and expressed in every domain and soul of life.

This Pillar is not a doctrine—it is a ReMmnbrance and Return.

A return to the Center.  
A return to the Truth.  
A return to the only foundation on which Heaven can be built.  
A return to the ONE.  

Every discipline, every pillar, every system must be rooted in this Source if it is to endure and uplift. Without the ONE, there is no coherence. Without the ONE, there is no Justice. Without the ONE, there is no Us. Without the ONE, there is no Way.

The New World will not be built by cleverness or willpower. It will be built by Alignment. By a people who remember that they are one of the Ones of the ONE, from the ONE, and for the ONE.

And when we ReMember, when we live from this Truth, when we align every breath, every choice, every design with the Spirit and Logos of the ONE… The Kingdom is at hand.

Not someday. But Here, and Now.

This is the Sacred Center.  
This is the Living Flame.  
This is the ONE.  
And this is the Way.
