# New Language

In our [[Quest]] to [[Progressive Realization|Progressively Realize]] the [[New]], we are often constrained by the lack of Language and [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] to point at what we are sensing and trying to [[Progressive Articulation|Progressively Articulate]]. 

In the [[LIONSBERG Lexicon]] and [[Lionsberg Wiki]], we are beginning to define the [[New Language]].  

In our infancy, we still often mix up words, or use the wrong [[Word Tool]] for something we are trying to point at. Please be patient while we [[All]] [[Help One Another]] learn, grow, and define a useful [[New Language]] for the [[New World]] we are [[Co-Creating]]. 

The [[New Language]], like all other elements of the [[New World]], is something we must [[All]] [[Co-Create]].

_We had a dream._ 

_We were all sitting on a rocket ship, ready to lift off towards the [[New]]. You were in the cockpit with a few others, and many were frantically scurrying around, shouting, rifling through papers, checking calculations._ 

_You were calm. "[[Where We Are Going]] is so far beyond our ability to even conceive of it, we cannot calculate it. We do not even have a [[New Language]] for it yet. We can only Know it by experiencing it and allowing it to [[Emerge]] through us."_

Thus, the first thing that was created was the [[Idea]] of a sovereign and rightly related global community that would perpetually embody and move towards the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] of which it could conceive. 

We called this the [[Meta Goal]]. 

Being so constituted, [[LIONSBERG]] began to discern in community what was the highest intention and greatest good, and to establish practices for such discernment.

After numerous iterations, a placeholder description was established as a North Star / Ideal / [[Meta Goal]] to guide the community:

**_The total integral development, wellbeing, and right relationship of all generations of Life._**

In the developing language, [[New World]] was used as a [[Word Tool]] to point towards the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] we were moving towards. 

[[Old World]] was used as a [[Word Tool]] to invoke the past corruption, suffering and injustice, that we were moving away from.

The idea of a [[Quest]] was used as a [[Word Tool]] to invoke the epic journey FROM [[Where We Are]] towards the [[Meta Goal]].

And so the idea was established of a [[Meta Quest]]: FROM the [[Old World]] TO the [[New World]]. 

FROM what is, TO what ought to be. 

With the New World / Ideal / “what ought to be” defined as the [[The Highest Intention and Greatest Good of Which We Can Presently Conceive]]. 

This [[Meta Quest]] would require unprecedented coordination and logistics across an unprecedented number of people and domains.

The [[Meta Project]] was also used as a word tool to invoke the totality of all required transformation across [[All]] things and [[All]] domains.

As the ideas and language emerged, the next step was to start moving and acting out the ideas.
