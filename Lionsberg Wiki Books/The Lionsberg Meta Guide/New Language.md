# New Language

In our [[Quest]] to [[Progressive Realization|Progressively Realize]] the [[New]], we are often constrained by the lack of Language and [[Word Tool|Word Tools]] to point at what we are sensing and trying to [[Progressive Articulation|Progressively Articulate]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg Lexicon]] we are beginning to define the [[New Language]] that [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] began using in  [[The Book of Lionsberg]] and the [[Lionsberg System]].  

In our infancy, we still often mix up words, or use the wrong [[Word Tool]] for something we are trying to point at. Please be patient while we [[All]] [[Help One Another]] learn, grow, and define a useful [[New Language]] for the [[New World]] we are [[Co-Creating]]. 

The [[New Language]], like all other elements of the [[New World]], is something we must [[All]] [[Co-Create]].

_We had a dream._ 

_We were all sitting on a rocket ship, ready to lift off towards the [[New]]. You were in the cockpit with a few others, and many were frantically scurrying around, shouting, rifling through papers, checking calculations._ 

_You were calm. "[[Where We Are Going]] is so far beyond our ability to even conceive of it, we cannot calculate it. We do not even have a [[New Language]] for it yet. We can only Know it by experiencing it and allowing it to [[Emerge]] through us."_
