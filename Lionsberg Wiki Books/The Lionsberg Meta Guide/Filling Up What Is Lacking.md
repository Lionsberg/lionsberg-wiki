# Filling Up What Is Lacking

This is the basic idea that if we are moving towards the [[Best Possible Future]], and we see something that is lacking, we should fill it up. 

If it exists in the New World, and it does not exist [[Where We Are]], then we Co-Create it. 

This statement works in parallel with [[Removing What Does Not Belong|Remove What Does Not Belong]]. 

___

What elements of the Massive, Positive, and Good [[Forward Looking Story]] of  [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]] (Individually, Family, Community, Society, Living System) are missing? 

If [[Lionsberg]] / the [[New World]] is lacking in anything, we work together to fill it up. 

If it belongs in the [[New World]], it belongs in [[Lionsberg]].  

If we see anything that is missing, we check to see if it in already contained in the [[Lionsberg Plans and Specifications]]. If it is, we make sure it is appropriately prioritized and linked in the [[System Wide Master Plan]]. 

If it is not, we add it to the [[Issue Tracker]].
