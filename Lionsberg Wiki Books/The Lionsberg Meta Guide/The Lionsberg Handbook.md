### A Vision Of A More Perfect World  

Lionsberg begins with a massive, positive, and good [[Vision]] of the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

[[Vision]] 
[[Lionsberg Vision]]  
[[Lionsberg Mandate]]  
[[Best Possible Future]]  
[[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]  

### Aiming At The Goal 

It then sets this [[Vision]] and [[Goal]] as the [[Aim]] of the [[System]], and empowers individuals and groups around the world to align their vision and aim with the [[Meta Aim]] of [[All]].

[[Goal]]  
[[Meta Goal]]

[[Aligning]] 
[[Stacking Up And Aligning]]  

### Progressing Towards The Goal

Having aligned our [[Aim]], the system then connects and empowers sovereign autonomous individuals, organizations and groups to [[Help One Another]] progress towards [[The Goal]].  

[[Progress]]  
[[Navigation]]  
[[FROM -> TO]]  
[[Navigation Issue]]  

### Universal Principles and Values 

Having inspired, aligned, and empowered sovereign autonomous groups to progress towards [[The Goal]], the System then sets out universal [[Principles]] and [[Values]] to create the boundaries in which creative progress can occur. 

[[The Lionsberg System of Values]]  

## Levels of Abstraction 

The Lionsberg System sets out a sophisticated and differentiated view of the various levels of abstraction, starting with and ending with pure consciousness. This understanding is critical to informing where and how perception, thought, analysis and action are occurring. 

[[Levels of Abstraction]]  

## A Comprehensive System of Systems 

[[Lionsberg System]]  

## The Lionsberg System of Self-Governance 

The basis of [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]] within the boundaries of shared [[Vision]] and [[Values]] is [[Self Governance]] and [[Integrated Delivery]]. As a [[System]] purpose-built to empower sovereign autonomous progress towards shared goals and values, the [[Lionsberg System]] is based on [[Self Governance]] from the bottom up.

## The Economy

## Success and Failure 

To avoid [[Failure]] and achieve [[Success]], we must [[Help One Another]] [[Progress]] along the [[Critical Path]] that marks the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## The Meta Crisis 

[[The Movement]] will be "pulled" towards [[The Goal]] by inspiration, and "pushed" towards [[The Goal]] by the pain and dysfunction of the [[Meta Crisis]]. 

## No One Left Behind 

We will [[Doing Our Best|Do Our Best]] to invite [[All]], and ensure that no one is left behind. 

## Sovereignty and Autonomy 

Each individual, group, and community is and must remain [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and [[Free]]. 

All collaboration and [[Decision Making]] occurs on the basis of [[Voluntary Consent]]. 

## A Decentralized Federation

Lionsberg is emerging as a decentralized federation. Decentralization will ensure [[Sovereignty]], [[Autonomy]], and [[Anti-Fragility]]. Federation will afford [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among Sovereigns. 

## Shared Infrastructure, Resources, and Support 

Lionsberg will continuously improve a [[Commons]] of shared infrastructure resources, and support to connect and empower [[Sovereigns]]. 

## Reciprocal Contributions 

The current [[Hypothesis]] is that we should voluntarily allocate ~10% of the [[Flow]] of  time, energy, and resources to co-operate at the federal level. These [[Reciprocal Monthly Contribution]]s will initially be stewarded and allocated by the US 501(c)(3) to operate the [[Core Enterprise]] and continuously improve the commons of shared infrastructure, resources, and support. 

## Universal Wisdom, Principles, and Values 

Lionsberg and [[The Movement]] are bounded by universal [[Wisdom]], [[Principles]], and [[Values]] that govern the domain and our progress. 

## The Great Game of Lionsberg 

To invite the spirit of play and ensure [[The Movement]] is accessible to [[All]], we are [[Co-Creating]] [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]. 

## The Meta Project 

To invite the spirit of competence and ensure [[The Movement]] succeeds, we will [[Act As If]] our [[Work]] were part of one universal [[Meta Project]]. 

## The Battle 

To ensure we are not naive about the forces of ignorance and evil that will beset us, we will [[Act As If]] we are in [[The Battle]] for [[The Future]] of life and society on Earth. 

## The Call to Adventure 

While we have forged a hypothesis and charted some milestones, the reality is that we are embarking on a transformative journey into the [[Unknown]]. It will be an [[Adventure]]. 

## Governance and Navigation 

To help us [[Navigate]] towards [[The Goal]], we will continuously improve the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]]. 

## Obstacles and Opportunities 

Our single-minded focus and [[Navigation]] towards [[The Goal]] will illuminate the [[Obstacles]] and [[Opportunities]] that stand in our [[Way]]. 

## Tools and Anti-Tools 

The necessity to grapple with [[Obstacles]] and [[Opportunities]] will reveal [[Tools]] and [[Anti-Tools]]. 

## Higher Order Functional Unity 

Avoiding [[Failure]] and achieving [[Success]] will require that we forge out of our diverse parts one [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] actually capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems, and accomplishing the goals at hand. 

## The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity 

Our hypothesis is that we are now in [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], and that [[Success]] demands that [[The Movement]] engage [[All]] humanity within this window of time. 

## The First 18 Months 

The first 18 months, from May 2023 to November 2024, are particularly critical. During this time, [[The Movement]] must reach escape velocity and elect an independent U.S. President with a global mandate to implement the [[New Vision and Plan]]. This makes all subsequent milestones possible. 

## The Lionsberg Communications System 

We will communicate via the [[Lionsberg Communications System]].  This provides an archivable, searchable, harvestable, indexible place where what we think and know can emerge. 

## The System Wide Master Plan 

We will continuously improve a [[System Wide Master Plan]] to ensure that every individual, group, and community understands the [[New Vision and Plan]], and the [[Critical Path]]. 

## The Lionsberg Navigation System 

We will navigate together by continuously improving the [[Lionsberg Navigation System]]. In its minimum viable form, this consists of: 

1. Periodic [[Requests For Guidance]] from Lionsberg out to the array of autonomous groups, and reciprocal [[Requests For Guidance]] from each group back to Lionsberg.  
2. Progressive implementation of the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]].  


## The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System 

We will progressively implement the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] to stack up, align, and resource [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System will track the [[Network of Commitments]] between [[Groups]] relative to the [[Critical Path]].
