# The Lionsberg Handbook

This is a [[Work In Progress]] that Aims to bring together various guides into a comprehensive handbook. Please be patient with tones, tenses and voices that are not coherent as we work to bring a vast conceptual landscape into form. 

*The Lionsberg Handbook is in the process of migrating its pieces into [[The LIONSBERG Way]]. As a consequence, both may appear fragmented for a period of Time.*

## The Game 

[[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]  

## The Economy 

[[Lionsberg Economic System]] 

## Success and Failure 

To avoid [[Failure]] and achieve [[Success]], we must [[Help One Another]] [[Progress]] along the [[Critical Path]] that marks the [[Way]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

## The Meta Crisis 

[[The Movement]] will be "pulled" towards [[The Goal]] by inspiration, and "pushed" towards [[The Goal]] by the pain and dysfunction of the [[Meta Crisis]]. 

## No One Left Behind 

We will [[Doing Our Best|Do Our Best]] to invite [[All]], and ensure that no one is left behind. 

## Sovereignty and Autonomy 

Each individual, group, and community is and must remain [[Sovereign]], [[Autonomous]], and [[Free]]. 

All collaboration and [[Decision Making]] occurs on the basis of [[Voluntary Consent]]. 

## A Decentralized Federation

Lionsberg is emerging as a decentralized federation. Decentralization will ensure [[Sovereignty]], [[Autonomy]], and [[Anti-Fragility]]. Federation will afford [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] among Sovereigns. 

## Shared Infrastructure, Resources, and Support 

Lionsberg will continuously improve a [[Commons]] of shared infrastructure resources, and support to connect and empower [[Sovereigns]]. 

## Reciprocal Contributions 

The current [[Hypothesis]] is that we should voluntarily allocate ~10% of the [[Flow]] of  time, energy, and resources to co-operate at the federal level. These [[Reciprocal Monthly Contribution]]s will initially be stewarded and allocated by the US 501(c)(3) to operate the [[Core Enterprise]] and continuously improve the commons of shared infrastructure, resources, and support. 

## Universal Wisdom, Principles, and Values 

Lionsberg and [[The Movement]] are bounded by universal [[Wisdom]], [[Principles]], and [[Values]] that govern the domain and our progress. 

## The Great Game of Lionsberg 

To invite the spirit of play and ensure [[The Movement]] is accessible to [[All]], we are [[Co-Creating]] [[The Great Game of Lionsberg]]. 

## The Meta Project 

To invite the spirit of competence and ensure [[The Movement]] succeeds, we will [[Act As If]] our [[Work]] were part of one universal [[Meta Project]]. 

## The Battle 

To ensure we are not naive about the forces of ignorance and evil that will beset us, we will [[Act As If]] we are in [[The Battle]] for [[The Future]] of life and society on Earth. 

## The Call to Adventure 

While we have forged a hypothesis and charted some milestones, the reality is that we are embarking on a transformative journey into the [[Unknown]]. It will be an [[Adventure]]. 

## Governance and Navigation 

To help us [[Navigate]] towards [[The Goal]], we will continuously improve the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]]. 

## Obstacles and Opportunities 

Our single-minded focus and [[Navigation]] towards [[The Goal]] will illuminate the [[Obstacles]] and [[Opportunities]] that stand in our [[Way]]. 

## Tools and Anti-Tools 

The necessity to grapple with [[Obstacles]] and [[Opportunities]] will reveal [[Tools]] and [[Anti-Tools]]. 

## Higher Order Functional Unity 

Avoiding [[Failure]] and achieving [[Success]] will require that we forge out of our diverse parts one [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] actually capable of meeting the needs, solving the problems, and accomplishing the goals at hand. 

## The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity 

Our hypothesis is that we are now in [[The 7 Year Window of Crisis and Opportunity]], and that [[Success]] demands that [[The Movement]] engage [[All]] humanity within this window of time. 

## The First 18 Months 

The first 18 months, from May 2023 to November 2024, are particularly critical. During this time, [[The Movement]] must reach escape velocity and elect an independent U.S. President with a global mandate to implement the [[New Vision and Plan]]. This makes all subsequent milestones possible. 

## The Lionsberg Communications System 

We will communicate via the [[Lionsberg Communications System]].  This provides an archivable, searchable, harvestable, indexible place where what we think and know can emerge. 

## The System Wide Master Plan 

We will continuously improve a [[System Wide Master Plan]] to ensure that every individual, group, and community understands the [[New Vision and Plan]], and the [[Critical Path]]. 

## The Lionsberg Navigation System 

We will navigate together by continuously improving the [[Lionsberg Navigation System]]. In its minimum viable form, this consists of: 

1. Periodic [[Requests For Guidance]] from Lionsberg out to the array of autonomous groups, and reciprocal [[Requests For Guidance]] from each group back to Lionsberg.  
2. Progressive implementation of the [[Lionsberg System of Governance]].  


## The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System 

We will progressively implement the [[Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System]] to stack up, align, and resource [[Throughput]] of [[The Goal]]. 

The Lionsberg Integrated Delivery System will track the [[Network of Commitments]] between [[Groups]] relative to the [[Critical Path]].
