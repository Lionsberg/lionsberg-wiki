# Who We Are

If [[We]] must [[Working Together To Make It So|Work Together To Make It So]] through the act of [[Conscious]] [[Co-Creation]], we must begin by differentiating [[Who We Are]]. 

We are [[All]] who are part of the universal [[Force For Good]]. 

Streaming from every tribe, every nation, and every people towards the [[Standard]] that has been lifted up. 

We are billions strong. 

And we are becoming one. 

We are becoming one, but we are each inexhaustibly unique, valued, and special. We each have our own [[Story]]. We each have our own [[Culture]]. We each have our own [[Language]].  

What we share is [[One]] [[Spirit]] and [[Intention]], which is the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] that impels us [[All]] to advance [[Forward]] in [[The Great Movement]] of [[All]] [[Life]] towards its [[Best And Highest]] [[Potential]] and [[Destiny]]. 

We are [[All]] one, who are advancing with [[One]] and [[All]] towards [[The Goal]], by [[Helping All Do The Same]].  

That is [[True]] in the [[Story]]. It is [[True]] in our hearts and minds. It is [[True]] in our desires. It is [[True]] in our [[True Self]].  

Yet it is not our present [[Reality]]. We are still, to varying degrees, [[Embody|Embodying]] our [[False Self]]. 

We are still battling within our [[Selves]]. We are still separated. We are still divided. We are still disintegrated. The various parts of Us are still competing and grasping and repelling. 

So perhaps the [[Vision]] of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with [[One]] and [[All]] is more like [[Who We Are Becoming]].
