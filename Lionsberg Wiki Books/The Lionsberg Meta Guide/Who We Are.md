# Who We Are

## Introduction

Who we are is a fundamental question at the heart of the Lionsberg journey. As we embark on this transformative quest, we are called to reflect on our individual and collective identities, exploring the narratives that have shaped us and envisioning who we aspire to become.

## The Importance of Identity

Identity is our understanding of who we are. It's shaped by various factors such as our personal history, cultural background, experiences, values, and aspirations. It plays a crucial role in how we perceive ourselves, how we interact with others, and how we navigate the world.

**Personal Identity:** This is our understanding of ourselves as unique individuals. It includes our self-concept, personal values, and aspirations.

**Collective Identity:** This is our understanding of ourselves as part of various groups and communities. It shapes our sense of belonging and influences our attitudes, behaviors, and interactions.

**Aspirational Identity:** This is our vision of [[Who We Are Becoming]]. It inspires our growth, guides our choices, and motivates our actions.

## Lionsberg and Identity

Understanding and consciously shaping our identities are key aspects of personal and societal transformation. As part of the Lionsberg journey, we engage in reflective practices to explore our identities, foster self-awareness, and envision our individual and collective futures.

## Key Concepts

**Identity Exploration:** This is the process of examining and understanding our identities. It involves self-reflection, openness, and a willingness to engage with complexity and diversity.

**Identity Transformation:** This is the process of consciously evolving our identities in alignment with our growth, values, and aspirations. It involves making choices and taking actions that reflect our evolving understanding of who we are and who we aspire to become.

**Co-Creation of Identity:** Every participant in the Lionsberg journey contributes to the collective identity of Lionsberg. By sharing our unique perspectives and experiences, we shape and enrich our shared identity.

## Activity for Today

Take some time to reflect on your personal and collective identities. Consider the narratives, experiences, and values that have shaped you. Then, envision your aspirational identity. Who do you want to become? What values, attitudes, and behaviors do you want to cultivate? What are some of the smallest steps you could take to begin manifesting more of who you want to be? 




If [[We]] must [[Working Together To Make It So|Work Together To Make It So]] through the act of [[Conscious]] [[Co-Creation]], we must begin by differentiating [[Who We Are]]. 

We are [[All]] who are part of the universal [[Force For Good]]. 

Streaming from every tribe, every nation, and every people towards the [[Standard]] that has been lifted up. 

We are billions strong. 

And we are becoming one. 

We are becoming one, but we are each inexhaustibly unique, valued, and special. We each have our own [[Story]]. We each have our own [[Culture]]. We each have our own [[Language]].  

What we share is [[ONE]] [[Spirit]] and [[Intention]], which is the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] that impels us [[All]] to advance [[Forward]] in [[The Great Movement]] of [[All]] [[Life]] towards its [[Best And Highest]] [[Potential]] and [[Destiny]]. 

We are [[All]] one, who are advancing with [[ONE]] and [[All]] towards [[The Goal]], by [[Helping All Do The Same]].  

That is [[True]] in the [[Story]]. It is [[True]] in our hearts and minds. It is [[True]] in our desires. It is [[True]] in our [[True Self]].  

Yet it is not our present [[Reality]]. We are still, to varying degrees, [[Embody|Embodying]] our [[False Self]]. 

We are still battling within our [[Selves]]. We are still separated. We are still divided. We are still disintegrated. The various parts of Us are still competing and grasping and repelling. 

So perhaps the [[Vision]] of [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with [[ONE]] and [[All]] is more like [[Who We Are Becoming]].
