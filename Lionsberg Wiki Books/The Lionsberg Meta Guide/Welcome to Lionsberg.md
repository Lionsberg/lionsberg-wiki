# Welcome to Lionsberg 

Greetings, and welcome to [[Lionsberg]]. 

We are glad you are here. 

What if... a global community arose and united to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], and co-create a [[Better World]]? 

Lionsberg was purpose-built by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a network of allies to land humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]]. 

It was created to serve and empower humanity (~10 billion people, ~1 billion groups, ~10 million communities) to collectively reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a world that gets a little closer to [[Heaven On Earth]] every day.

The [[Lionsberg Summary]] is a good place to begin.
