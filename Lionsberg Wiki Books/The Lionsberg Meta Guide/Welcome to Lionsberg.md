# Welcome to Lionsberg 

Greetings, and welcome to [[LIONSBERG]]. 

We are glad you are here. 

What if... a global community arose and united to co-create a [[Better World]]? 

Lionsberg was purpose-built by [[Jordan Nicholas Sukut]] and a network of allies for the definite [[Purpose]] of confronting and overcoming the [[Meta Crisis]] and establishing the [[Kingdom of God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

It was created to serve and empower humanity (~10 billion people, ~1 billion groups, ~10 million communities) to collectively reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a world that gets a little closer to [[Heaven On Earth]] every day.
