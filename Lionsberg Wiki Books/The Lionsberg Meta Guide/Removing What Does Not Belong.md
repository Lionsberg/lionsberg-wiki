# Removing What Does Not Belong

This is the basic idea that if we are moving towards the [[Best Possible Future]], and we see something that does not belong in the [[New]], we should remove it. 

If it does not exist in the [[New World]], and it exists [[Where We Are]], then we remove it. 

This statement works in parallel with [[Filling Up What Is Lacking]]. 

___

What elements of our current [[Reality]] are incompatible with the Massive, Positive, and Good [[Forward Looking Story]] of  [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]] (Individually, Family, Community, Society, Living System)? 

In any element of our current [[Reality]] does not belong in [[Lionsberg]] / the [[New World]], we [[Work Together]] to remove it. 

If it does not belong in the [[New World]], it does not belong in [[Lionsberg]]. #principle 

If we see anything that does not belong, we add it to the [[Issue Tracker]].
