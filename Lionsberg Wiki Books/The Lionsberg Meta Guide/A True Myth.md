# A True Myth

This is a [[True]] Story. 

But we must define what we mean by [[True]].  

This Story is [[True]] in the sense that all sacred myths are [[True]].  

It is [[True]] not in the sense that is accurately represents what is actually happening in any one specific time and place, but that it represents what is happening in [[All]] times and [[All]] places at this unique moment in the [[Story]]. 

It is intended to become a Faithful [[Embodiment]] of the [[Meta Story]]. 

The degree to which [[The Story of Lionsberg]]  will become [[True]] and Embodied in your specific [[Time]] and [[Space]] depends on us together. 

Because we are [[Co-Creating]] our [[Reality]], right [[Here]] and [[Now]]. 

[[One]] and [[All]] are the conceptual limits of the [[Highest Order Functional Unity]] that encompasses [[All]] things.  

We are [[All]], individually and collectively, part of this Fundamental Unity, whether we acknowledge and act like it or not.
