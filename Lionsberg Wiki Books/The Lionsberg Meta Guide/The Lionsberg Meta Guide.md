## Introduction

Lionsberg is a mythical name for the [[Best Possible Future]], and a [[System of Systems]] to empower humanity (10 billion people, 1 billion groups, 10 million communities) to bring it into reality. 

In religious language, it is a system purpose-built to bring Heaven to Earth ([[The Goal]]).

### Universal Principles and Values

## The Lionsberg System of Self-Governance 

The basis of [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]] within the boundaries of shared [[Vision]] and [[Values]] is [[Self Governance]] and [[Integrated Delivery]]. As a [[System]] purpose-built to empower sovereign autonomous progress towards shared goals and values, the [[Lionsberg System]] is based on [[Self Governance]] from the bottom up.
