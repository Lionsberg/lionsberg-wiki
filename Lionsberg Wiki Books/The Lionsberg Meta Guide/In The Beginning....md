# In The Beginning... 

In the beginning, [[ONE]] is the [[Source and Sustainer]] of [[All]], and nothing that is came to Be except through [[ONE]]. 

All manifest things arising from the [[ONE]] [[Uncaused Cause]] experience being [[Thrown]] into a particular [[Time]] and [[Space]], and coming into being somewhere as someone. 

Disoriented, confused, and often suffering, we must discover [[Who We Are]], [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]]. 

Early in the 3rd millennium AD, humanity awakened to find itself facing [[The Final Test]]â€”and on the verge of drowning in the Dark waters of [[Chaos]], Dysfunction, and Kaptivity. 

Wrenched out of unconsciousness by the dark cold waters, it found itself gasping and grasping for something to hold onto. Its grip on the sinking carcass of the [[Old]] [[Vessel of Society]] was failing, and the roiling seas of [[Chaos]] threatened to take it under. 

Suddenly, on the horizon, a [[Light]]. 

The [[Spirit]] rose up and hovered over the surface of the waters. 

As it began speaking the [[Logos]] in [[Truth]] and [[Love]], the waters began to subside around it and a [[New Vessel]] appeared, striding effortlessly over the waves that were pushing us down. 

As the [[New Vessel]] approach, a Loving Hand reached out and began lifting us up, one by one, out of the seas of [[Chaos]], and into an ark that was Strong and Good, purpose-built to carry Us up out of the Dark waters and [[Forward]] towards our [[Destiny]]. 

[[LIONSBERG]] was [[On The Move]].
