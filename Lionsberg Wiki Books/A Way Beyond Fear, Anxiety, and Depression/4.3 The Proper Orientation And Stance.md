# 4.3 The Proper Orientation And Stance

Now that we have at least some form of Worthy Aim, it is time to learn to move towards it. 

To advance [[Forward]] towards our [[Worthy Goal]], proper orientation, order, posture, and stance are important. 

Our entire [[Being]] and [[Embodiment]] must be integrated and properly composed. 

When our [[True Self]] emerges coherently and in [[Proper Order]]: 

- We are balanced 
- Our eyes are up  
- Our shoulders are back 
- Our spine is straight  
- We are Focused outward from the Self  
- We are Focused forward from the Self  
- Our [[True Self]] is attending to others  
- We are aware  
- We are paying attention  
- We are receptive in all directions 
- We are attending to what is emergent  
- We are perceiving the patterns and potentials 
- We are picking up on the cues 
- We are expanding outward 
- We are spiraling upward 
- We are Forward of Center advancing in the [[Wise Right]] [[Way]] towards our [[Worthy Aim]]  
- We are embodying Wise, Sophisticated Ways of Being and Patterns of Action 
- We are Loving, Serving, Encouraging, and Empowering One and All  

Every time we advance or move, we should move in this [[Way]].
