# 1.11 Brain To Body Signaling

Recall that we previously learned that the default state of the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] tends to be highly activated, or "turned on" to a state we often experience as Anxiety or Fear.

The [[Autonomic Nervous System]] remains in this state until our Prefrontal Cortex sends signals through the [[Vagus Nerve]] to the body, "turning down" or adjusting the level of activation to what the brain perceives as appropriate based on the [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]].

We can think of our [[Embodiment]] and our [[Mind]] as being engaged in a continuous dialogue with each other, with the Insula acting as a mediator.

One of the primary methods for triggering brain-to-body signals that calm the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] is to maintain a state of [[Consciousness]] that makes envisioning and accessing multiple [[Potential Futures]] and [[Patterns Of Action]] possible.
