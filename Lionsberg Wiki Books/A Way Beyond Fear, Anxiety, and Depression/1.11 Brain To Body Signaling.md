# 1.11 Brain To Body Signaling

Recall that earlier we learned that by default, the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] is "turned on" to high, or to a state we often experience as anxiety. 

The [[Autonomic Nervous System]] remains in this state until our Prefrontal Cortex sends signals back down to the body via the [[Vagus Nerve]] which "turn down" the dial to a level of Energization that the brain believes appropriate given the [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]]. 

We can therefore think of our [[Embodiment]] and our [[Mind]] in a dialogue with one another, mediated by the Insula. 

One of the primary ways to trigger the brain to body signaling that calms the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] down is to discover and remain in a state of [[Consciousness]] through which you can envision and access multiple potential futures and patterns of action.
