# 3.14 Limit Stories 

Sacred texts like the Bible do something absolutely amazing. 

They tell us [[Limit Stories]] that push us to the conceptual [[Absolute]], and then invite us to adopt the Limit Story as our own. 

This is exactly the same idea as [[Choosing A Worthy Aim]]. If we are going to [[Consciously Generate]] an array of stories, [[Consciously Evaluate]] them, and [[Consciously Decide]] which one of them we are going to [[Aim]] to [[Enact]] and [[Embody]]...

...there is only [[ONE]] possible thing we should Aim at, and that is the [[Best And Highest]] [[ONE]]. 

The [[Best And Highest]] [[ONE]] is the Limit Story. The [[Best And Highest]] [[ONE]] is our [[Aim]]. The [[Best And Highest]] [[ONE]] is our [[Goal]]. 

In the Bible, the limit story of [[Being]] is [[God]], the limit story of [[Doing]] is the [[Kingdom Of God]], and the limit story of suffering and triumph as the embodiment of the Spirit of God on earth is the story of the messiah. 

If we are going to [[Aim]] at [[Being]] something, the only ethical [[Aim]] is to be perfect, as [[God]] is perfect. This is why Jesus spoke the famous words "Be ye perfect therefore, as your Heavenly Father is perfect." 

If we are going to [[Aim]] at [[Doing]] something, the only ethical [[Aim]] is to do the perfect will and intention of God, on earth as it is in heaven, which is the [[Kingdom Of God]], on earth as it is in heaven. This is why Jesus spoke the famous words "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and all these things will be added unto you."  

You cannot push the stories any further than the Incarnation of Realization of [[Absolute]] perfection, on earth as it is in heaven. 

And the strange thing is, as imperfect as we presently are, you and I are invited to share in this perfection, and in the co-creation of the [[Best Possible Future]] for [[All]].
