# 4.2 Dopamine 

At an elementary level, [[Dopamine]] can be thought of as the physiological currency of motivation and Forward progress.  

Dopamine is released by neurons and acts as a neurotransmitter, sending signals to other nerve cells. 

Dopamine is modulated to signal the perceived level of pain or pleasure, desirability or aversiveness, associated with an Objective or Outcome. 

This modulation then drives the living organism towards or away from the Goal or outcome. 

The levels of dopamine in the brain rise predominantly _in anticipation_ of pleasure or reward.
