## The Individual And The Collective 

We understand approximately how to do this individually. 

The question is: How can we do this collectively, before it is too late? 

## Hypothesis

- We need to formulate a massive, positive, good, inspiring, compelling [[Vision]].  
- We need to formulate a massive, positive, good, inspiring, compelling [[Forward Looking Story]] to help us [[All]] understand [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]. 
	- This needs to be done at the level of the individual and every group (tribe / nation / people), and the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Forward Looking Stories]] needs to be stacked up and aligned. 
- We need to formulate a massive, positive, good, inspiring, compelling [[Backward Looking Story]] to help us [[All]] understand [[Where We Are]] and [[How We Got Here]]. 
	- This needs to be done at the level of the individual and every group (tribe / nation / people), and the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Backward Looking Stories]] needs to be stacked up and aligned.
- We need to identify and incorporate a broad range of universal [[Values]] and [[Virtues]] into our individual and collective [[Personality]], so that we become the kinds of expansive people who are capable of contending with and overcoming whatever dares to come our [[Way]]. 
- This needs to be accomplished through a shared [[Process]] and [[Experience]] that all 8 billion people can be invited to participate in, facilitated through shared infrastructure. 
- The outcome needs to be a System of [[Self Governance]] that empowers every individual, organization, and community to [[Help One Another]] develop towards the fullness of their unique [[Potential]] and flourish in harmony. 
- This will likely emerge via a [[Group Of Groups]] connected to a shared infrastructure platform, that empowers each group to localize and adapt the [[Prototype]] into their own time, place, language, culture, and context. 

Our individual and collective [[Consciousness]] is absolutely able to transform and heal itself through such a process. 

And such a process can be completed within the next 3.5 to 7 years for [[All]], without exception. 

## The Conditions For Emergence

We have been working to [[Co-Create]] the [[Provisional Conditions]] under which such a universal realignment and movement could occur. 

We have set up a comprehensive [[System of Systems]] to facilitate all aspects - see the [[Lionsberg System]]. 

I hope this helps. 

Much Love,
