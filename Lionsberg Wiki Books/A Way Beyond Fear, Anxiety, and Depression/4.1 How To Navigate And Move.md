# How To Navigate And Move

As we prepare to venture Beyond The Boundaries that are imprisoning us, on our epic [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]...

...we now need to learn how to [[Navigate]] and move. 

We cover this in the [[The Book of Lionsberg]] in more detail. 

Remember the Green, Yellow, or Red system. 

As we begin to [[Progress]], one small step at a time, towards [[The Goal]], we have three basic orientations based on our [[Center of Gravity]]: 

- Forward of Center / advancing (pursuit, confrontation)  
- On Center / standing our ground (steady)  
- Backward of Center / retreating (flight, hiding)
