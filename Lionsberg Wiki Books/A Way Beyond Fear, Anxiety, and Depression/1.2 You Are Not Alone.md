# 1.2 You Are Not Alone

You are not alone in this suffering. 

In the depths of our despair, it can often feel like we are alone, uniquely suffering in a way no one could understand, and that there is something deeply wrong with us. 

I am so sorry that you are suffering. It is horrible to be experiencing what you are experiencing. I understand how deeply debilitating it can be. 

I am also not surprised. 

As human beings who possess the minds and bodies we do, living in the present state of our world, the anomaly is not when someone is anxious, fearful, or depressed. 

That is how we should naturally feel given [[Where We Are]]. 

What is surprising is when someone is able to overcome it. 

I know you may not believe me, but there are others out there experiencing something very similar to what you are experiencing. 

If you are willing to listen, I can offer you a [[Way]] of beginning to rise above the roiling seas of chaos and despair that feel like they are drowning you. 

It may not be perfect. But if you are drowning, it is a lifeline, and I deeply hope you grab hold. The world still needs you. More desperately than ever. 

If you are willing to take another small step and click forward, I will explain to you briefly what is happening physiologically and psychologically in your body and your brain, and then help you find the smallest step you can take, and would be willing to take, in the direction of Purpose, Meaning, and Liberty from your present suffering.
