# 3.3 Patterns Of Action

Our world is not so much composed of "things", as it is composed of energetic patterns. 

One type of energetic pattern is a Pattern of Action. 

Patterns of action could be thought of in two ways: 

1. A specific plan, or set of actions that could be undertaken in a given sequence to accomplish a given outcome 
2. An abstract [[Way of Being]], or Spirit, that could be embodied across a near infinite array of scenarios 

In our stories, we can play with spinning up avatars of our self who [[Enact]] and [[Embody]] different spirits, patterns, or plans, and we can see how they might turn out.
