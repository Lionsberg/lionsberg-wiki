# 2.9 Who We Are Becoming

As we have already said, the various [[Future Selves]] or Avatars...

...that potentially could [[Manifest]] themselves...

...to [[Enact]] various [[Patterns of Action]] / [[Plans of Action]]... 

...is practically limitless... 

...except as it is limited by the artificial [[Boundaries]] we tolerate or impose upon our Self. 

There is no more important question in our [[Forward Looking Story]] that [[Who We Are Becoming]].  

This is because it is impossible to get [[Where We Are Going]], without becoming something entirely [[New]] and of a [[Higher Order]] Kind than [[Who We Are]] today.
