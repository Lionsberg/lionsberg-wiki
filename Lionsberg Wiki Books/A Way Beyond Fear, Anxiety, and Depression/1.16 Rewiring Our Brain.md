# 1.16 Rewiring Our Brain

The encouraging news for those who are suffering is that not only is it normal to suffer, it is also entirely possible to transform and rewire the neural architecture of our brain.

By rewiring our brain, we can enhance and elevate our ability to enthusiastically navigate and progress on our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] of [[Life]].

The [[Neuroplasticity]], or the capacity of our brain to transform its structure and function in response to experience, is primarily triggered by dopaminergic functions that emerge relative to the anticipated pleasures and rewards contained in our Goal.

This response is activated when we engage in actions that advance us towards goals that we perceive as important and valuable. The anticipation of the reward contained in the Goal creates a state in which we are predisposed to learning and transforming our neural architecture.  

It all comes back to the [[Forward]] advance towards a [[Worthy Goal]].
