# 1.20 Stories

The various avatars (future selves) that potentially could manifest themselves to [[Enact]] various patterns of actions (plans) are processed by our [[Consciousness]] as (something like) [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]]. 

Once we can articulate various [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]], the possibilities and potentials of which are nearly infinite, we can pause in order to [[Consciously Decide]] which of them we will attempt to [[Realize]] and [[Enact]].  

This allows our dysfunctional stories to fail and die instead of us. 

As a human species, we have come to the edge of the [[Chasm]], and we are faced with whether we continue accelerating along our present trajectory and fail / die... 

...or whether we allow some of the stories we are telling our selves to die instead, so that we can progress onwards together towards [[Flourishing And Abundant Life]].  

This is why Wise elders have said that _without a Vision the people perish_. 

Let's not perish.
