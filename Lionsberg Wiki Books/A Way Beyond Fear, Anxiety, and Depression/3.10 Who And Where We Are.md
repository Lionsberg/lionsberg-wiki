# 3.10 Who And Where We Are 

Whereas the infinite depth and array of the Spirit and Potential within us is inexhaustible and boundless, [[Who We Are]] and [[Where We Are]] in our present [[Embodiment]] is finite and able to be comprehended. 

This is critical because it provides the [[Starting Point]], or Point A, that we can specifically pin down and identify, such that we can chart the course FROM [[Where We Are]] and [[Who We Are]] in this [[Time]] and [[Space]]... 

...TO [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]] in another [[Time]] and [[Space]].
