# 4.17 Each Day Is A Building Block

Each day of our lives is like a building block. 

What are we building? Upon what [[Foundation]]? 

Are we forced labor, shackled to the meaningless work of another day struggling for survival while building up the endless walls of our own prison? 

Are we idle and unfaithful, tossed to and fro by the waves of doubt, fear, and desire? 

Or are we meaningfully engaged in the eternal Meta Project to finally co-create a sacred [[Temple]] that is a dwelling place perfectly suited for fully enlightening [[Consciousness]]?  

Each day is a building block in eternal Temple of One and All. Place it well, in a Way that advances the Dwelling Place of [[One]] and [[All]] towards The Goal.
