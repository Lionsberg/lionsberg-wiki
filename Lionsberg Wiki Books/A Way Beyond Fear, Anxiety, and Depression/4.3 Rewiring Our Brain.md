# 4.3 Rewiring Our Brain

The good news is that it is possible to entirely transform and rewire the neural architecture of our brain. 

By rewiring our brain, we can elevate and transform our ability to enthusiastically navigate and move on our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]] of [[Life]]. 

The [[Neuroplasticity]], or ability of our brain to transform its structure and function in response to experience, is largely induced by the dopaminergic functions that manifest relative to the anticipated pleasures and rewards contained in our Goal. 

This response is unleashed when we engage in actions that advance us towards goals that we believe are important and valuable. The anticipation of the reward contained in the Goal creates a state in which we are predisposed to learning and transforming our neural architecture.  

It all comes back to the [[Forward]] advance towards a [[Worthy Goal]].
