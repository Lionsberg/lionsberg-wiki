# 2.4 A Multitude Of Stories

It might be that we would want to imagine and [[Envision]] a multitude of stories, not just one. 

We might want to envision many different versions of our selves, many different avatars with slightly different balances of personality. 

This multitude of avatars could each [[Enact]] a multitude of Plans or Ways of Being that would each turn out slightly, or dramatically, different because of different personality enacting it. 

For instance a specific plan of action enacted by an avatar that was more assertive and aggressive might turn out different than the same plan of action enacted by an avatar that was more passive and meek. 

In other words, there is a vast of ways we could Be, and a vast array of things we could Do, the combinations of which compose a nearly infinite array of [[Potential]] stories.
