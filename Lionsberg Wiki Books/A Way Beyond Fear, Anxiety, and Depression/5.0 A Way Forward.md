# 5.0 A Way Forward 

The basic next steps are to do what is outlined in [[4.13 What Comes Next]] for your Self. 

1. Articulate your [[Forward Looking Story]] - This will help you understand Who You Are, Where You Going, and Why
2. Articulate your [[Backward Looking Story]]  - This will help you understand Where You Are, and How You Got Here  
3. Articulate your **Worthy Aim** - no matter how small. This is the Key to aligning and regulating your Systems  
4. Choose the **smallest step** that you are **capable of taking**, that you are **willing to take**, and take it. 
5. Close the loop, gather the energy, learn, and do it again. Eventually ensure one of these steps connects you to a **small group** that cares, and to **Lionsberg**. 

One small step at a time, you will advance out of the hell of fear, anxiety, and depression, and towards The Goal of flourishing and abundant life. 

If you would like more, there is another [[Work In Progress]] called [[The Power of Today]]. You might find it helpful. 

With deep love and compassion, and in community and solidarity,
