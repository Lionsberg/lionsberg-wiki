# 2.1 Forward Looking Stories

The various [[Future Selves]] or Avatars...

...that potentially could [[Manifest]] themselves...

...to [[Enact]] various [[Patterns of Action]] / [[Plans of Action]]...

...are processed by our [[Consciousness]] as (something like) [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]].  

Any Good Future Self, and any Good Pattern Of Action you can conceive of, envision, and articulate, is Possible. 

Once we can articulate various [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]], the possibilities and potentials of which are nearly infinite and limited only by us...

...we can pause in order to [[Consciously Decide]] which of them we will attempt to [[Realize]] and [[Enact]].  

This allows our dysfunctional [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]] to fail and die instead of us.
