# 3.10 Self Limiting Beliefs

The good news is that because the boundaries and beliefs that exist in your mind...

...exist only there... 

... and not in [[Reality]]...

...you can change them. 

They are within you, and therefore within your [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]] and [[Conscious Agency]]

You have the power, responsibility, and authority to consciously elevate and transform them.
