# 1.6 Balance And Flow Of Energy In The System

Like all Systems, there is a balance and flow of [[Energy]] in your body and mind. 

If you are curious about how your body is built up, [[The Book of Lionsberg]] addresses this in section [[7.9 The Mystery Of The Microcosm]] through the balance of the chapter. 

In this book on overcoming anxiety, fear, and depression, out of the entire complex-adaptive system of systems that is a Human Being, we are going to focus on three basic elements: 

1. Consciousness  
2. Brain   
3. [[Autonomic Nervous System]]  

In particular, the flows of [[Energy]] and Communication in and between those systems. 

The Flow of Energy in the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] should ideally be balanced and optimized for the [[Reality]] we are experiencing at any given point in time. 

The Balance of [[Energy]] in the [[Autonomic Nervous System]] can be thought of along two basic scales: 

1. **Calmness vs. Alertness** (how energized the system is)  
2. **Anxiety vs. Exploration** (the degree to which we are in [[Fight or Flight]] mode, or curious exploration mode) 

The first dimension deals with how dialed up / turned on / primed the system is. 

The second dimension deals with whether that [[Energy]] is directed towards anxiety / threat / defense / retreat, or forward moving exploration and curiosity. 

The balance of energy in the system at any given time can be conceptualized along a continuum that runs from full calmness to full alertness. 

In a state of alertness our entire being is primed for action and ready to move. 

In a state of calm our entire being is relaxed. 

At one end of the continuum is pure, deep, relaxed, uninterrupted sleep. 

At the other end of the continuum is what we experience as a [[Panic Attach]] if the energy is tilted towards anxiety on the second continuum. 

The ideal state we want to work towards is the ability to modulate between calmness and alertness, with our alert periods propelling us forward in tangible steps towards goals that we value and desire. 

Ideally, our level of calmness or alertness, and anxiety vs. exploration, should be balanced appropriately relative to the level threats or opportunities in our environment at any given time. 

However that does not just happen automatically. 

Often, we experience our [[Autonomic Nervous System]] as either under-energized or over-energized, and leaning towards anxiety vs. exploration, in a way that feels inappropriate or disproportionate to the [[Reality]] that is at hand. 

The [[Way]] out is to use our [[Consciousness]] to adjust the balance and flow of [[Energy]] in the System.

Balancing the [[Energy]] of our System is actually part of our [[Domain Of Responsibility And Authority]]. It is an area in which we posses [[Conscious Agency]]. 

To do this, there is no [[Way]] beyond the present dysfunction except to get our [[Selves]] in motion towards a [[Worthy Goal]].
