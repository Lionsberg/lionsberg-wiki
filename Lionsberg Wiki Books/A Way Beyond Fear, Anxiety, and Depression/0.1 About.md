# 0.1 About

As I begin to move, one of the most common questions I get is about something I have grappled with deeply - how we can overcome anxiety, fear, and depression, and keep moving in a positive direction towards our highest goals despite the inevitable setbacks and challenges that come our Way. 

Through my own journey I have had to wrestle at very deep levels with these teachers. 

I would like to share with you what I have learned, in a Way that I hope helps you set your feet on the path towards the highest [[Potential]] and [[Best Possible Future]] for you and those around you.  

Everything herein I have learned from [[One]] or Another who has studied these matters deeply.  

None of the ideas are my own. Everything that is [[True]] belongs to [[One]] and [[All]]. 

If you find any [[Golden Thread|Golden Threads]] of [[Truth]] or [[Wisdom]] herein, please follow them and see where they lead. 

With Love, In Community,
