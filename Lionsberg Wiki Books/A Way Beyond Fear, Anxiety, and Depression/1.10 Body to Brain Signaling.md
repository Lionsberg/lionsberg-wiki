# 1.10 Body to Brain Signaling

From the standpoint of our [[Autonomic Nervous System]], there are three basic elements of body to brain signaling that occur: 

- Heart (rate and depth of heartbeat)  
- Breath (rate and depth of breathing)  
- Gut (Conditions)

These systems use both mechanical and chemical signals to communicate to the brain and [[Consciousness]] regarding the state and energetic balance of the [[Autonomic Nervous System]].  

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that these signals are received and mediated in the Prefrontal Cortex of the brain by the Insula (or Insular Cortex). 

The Insula appears to operate like a hub that mediates between [[Somatic]] signaling and the Prefrontal Cortex, which is often thought of as the seat of our [[Conscious Awareness]]. It also mediates signals relating to systems of threat detection and fear, emotions, and the general homeostasis of the body.
