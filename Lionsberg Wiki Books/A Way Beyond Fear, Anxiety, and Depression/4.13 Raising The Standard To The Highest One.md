# 4.13 Raising The Standard To The Highest One

When we truly begin to raise up the [[Standard]] towards the Highest and Only [[One]], we discover that the Object of [[Absolute]] and Unconditional [[Love]] and Perfection is also a terrifying [[Judge]]. 

It is a sensation of [[Absolute]] [[Awe]].  

Face to face with the terrifying [[Ideal]] of the [[One]], we have two choices: 

1. Attempt to tear down the [[Standard]] / [[Ideal]] to bring it closer to [[Where We Are]] and [[Who We Are]]  
2. Attempt to rise up towards the [[Standard]] / [[Ideal]] of [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]]  

There is only [[One]] [[Wise Right]] answer, which is to rise up towards the [[One]] [[Standard]] / [[Ideal]] / [[Meta Goal]].  

And when we commit to doing so, we discover something absolutely phenomenal. 

[[One]] begins to Help us rise, because [[One]] is [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]], and desperately longs for us to rise up towards [[Union]] with It. 

In fact, we discover that this is the entire [[Purpose]] of [[Life]]. 

To elevate and transform our [[Selves]] towards [[Perfect Unity]] with [[One]] and [[All]].  

And all the Forces of Good in the universe stand ready to help us towards that [[One]] [[Most Worthy Aim]].
