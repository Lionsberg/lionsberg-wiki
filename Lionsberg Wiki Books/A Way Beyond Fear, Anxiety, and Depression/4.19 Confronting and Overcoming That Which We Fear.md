# 4.10 Confronting and Overcoming That Which We Fear

The [[Way]] to deal with [[That Which We Fear]] is approach it purposely, voluntarily, and courageously. 

The [[Negative Emotion]] and response to [[That Which We Fear]] is suppressed and transformed in direct proportion to the degree to which the confrontation was based on [[Voluntary Consent]]. 

When we Voluntarily and Courageously approach [[That Which We Fear]], the entire physiological response transforms. 

When we are involuntarily confronted by [[That Which We Fear]], it often sets off an internal cascade of in which we are flooded with [[Negative Emotion]], we become hyper-aware of our [[Internal Context]], we rapidly withdraw inward from our [[External Context]], and then we panic and primordially freeze, flee, or attack to protect ourselves. 

Because [[That Which We Fear]] is present in [[Reality]] and may eventually manifest itself in our [[Way]], it is absolutely the wrong thing to try to endlessly, naively, and vainly try to  protect our Selves and our Loved Ones from it. 

This over-sheltering of our Loved Ones is a [[Patterns of Failure|Pattern of Failure]] that ends in death. 

Instead, especially [[Now]], we must expose our [[Selves]] to [[That Which We Fear]] so that when it inevitably manifests itself in our [[Way]], we are able to stay [[Conscious]], Aware, and Present, and not become possessed by any one of the primordial [[Idols Of The Pantheon]]. 

This completely changes the mental and physiological response and lays open for us a massive array of [[Potential Futures]] that would be otherwise inaccessible. 

Over time, this approach confronts and overcomes [[Fear]] not by making us less afraid, but by equipping us with deep [[Courage]], which generalizes across the total panoply of [[That Which We Fear]].
