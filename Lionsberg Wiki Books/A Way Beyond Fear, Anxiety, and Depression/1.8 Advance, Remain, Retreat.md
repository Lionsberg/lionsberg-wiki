# 1.8 Advance, Remain, Retreat

Let us imagine our [[Selves]] advancing on our Noble [[Quest]] towards our Goal. 

At any given time, we can have three basic orientations relative to the threats or opportunities that [[Presence]] themselves to us:  

- We can Advance 
- We can Remain where we are and hold our ground 
- We can Retreat 

In full advanced mode, we are curious,  explorational, and moving forward. 

In full retreat mode, we are overwhelmed with [[Anxiety]] and [[Fear]] and moving backwards or away.
