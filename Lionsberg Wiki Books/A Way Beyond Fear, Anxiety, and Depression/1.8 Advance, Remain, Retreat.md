# 1.8 Advance, Remain, Retreat

Let us imagine ourselves advancing on our noble [[Quest]] towards our [[Worthy Aim]], no matter how small or large.

At any given time, we can have three basic orientations relative to the threats or opportunities that presence themselves to us:

-   We can **Advance**. 
-   We can **Remain** where we are, pause, or hold our ground  
-   We can **Retreat**  

In full advance mode, we are curious, exploratory, and moving forward.

In full retreat mode, we are overwhelmed with anxiety and fear and moving backward or running away. 

This is somewhat like a Green, Yellow, Red traffic system.
