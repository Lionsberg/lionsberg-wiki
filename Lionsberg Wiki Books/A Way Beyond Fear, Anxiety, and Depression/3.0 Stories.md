# 3.0 Stories  

By now, we can see that getting into motion towards an Integrated and Worthy Goal requires that we sort out Our Story. 

Conscious Integration, Alignment, and Agency are articulated and cohered in our Minds through a [[Narrative Framework]], or Story. 

[[Thrown]] into a given [[Time]], [[Space]], and [[Context]], we generally have to answer fundamental [[Questions]] in order to orient our [[Selves]]. 

These questions look forwards and backwards, and revolve around both [[Being]] and [[Doing]]. 

They are something like: 

1. [[Where Am I]]?  
2. [[How Did I Get Here]]?  
3. [[Where Am I Going]]?   
4. [[Who Am I]]? 
5. [[Who Am I Becoming]]? 
6. [[Why]]?  

These questions thoughtfully answered form a cohesive [[Narrative Framework]] upon which we can hang all the other information in the Story. 

At a high level, we end up with [[Backward Looking Stories]] and [[Forward Looking Stories]] that extend out from [[Where We Are]].
