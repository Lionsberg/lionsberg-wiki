# 2.1 Envisioning Various Futures, Selves, and Plans

To help us achieve success and avoid failure on our [[Quest]] towards our [[Worthy Goal]]...

...our Prefrontal Cortex uses the information it receives from the Insula on our Embodied State of Being and [[Internal Context]]... 

...along with our total [[Perception]] of our environment and [[External Context]]...

...to help us envision various potentials we might [[Enact]] to advance towards our [[Goal]]. 

These potentials lay themselves out as [[Forward Looking Stories]] composed of potential selves, patterns of action, and responses from Reality, which generate an array of potential futures. 

Body to Brain Signaling is a wonderful gift that allows our [[Consciousness]] to take into account our [[State Of Embodiment]] as it generates potential futures. This is key to ensuring the potential patterns of action it generates "fit" all dimensions of our present reality, including our [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]]. 

This imaginative generation of multiple potential futures and plans of action is one of our greatest capabilities, as it allows us to evaluate potentials ***in the realm of abstraction*** before we [[Enact]] them. 

Each envisioned future is like a potential Plan of Action or Play that could be implemented, ***if we so choose***. 

Ideally, we then [[Consciously Choose]], out of all the potential visions of our future, the one most positive and Good [[Vision]] to attempt to [[Enact]], [[Embody]] and [[Realize]]. 

To be properly calibrated, these imagined [[Plans of Action]] ***must be relative to*** our Integrated and [[Worthy Goal]].
