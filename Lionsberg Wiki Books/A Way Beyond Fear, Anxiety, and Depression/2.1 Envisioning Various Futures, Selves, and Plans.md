# 2.1 Envisioning Various Futures, Selves, and Plans

To help us achieve success and avoid failure on our [[Quest]] towards our [[Worthy Goal]]...

...our Prefrontal Cortex uses the information it receives from the Insula on our Embodied State of Being and [[Internal Context]]... 

...along with our total [[Perception]] of our environment / [[External Context]]...

...to help us envision various [[Abstract]] Potential selves, futures, and patterns of action we might [[Enact]] to advance towards our [[Goal]]. 

Body to Brain Signaling is a wonderful gift that allows our [[Consciousness]] to take into account our [[State Of Embodiment]] as it generates potential futures. This is key to ensuring the potential patterns of action it generates "fit" all dimensions of our present reality, including our [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]]. 

This imaginative generation of multiple potential futures and plans of action is one of our greatest capabilities, as it allows us to evaluate potentials in the abstract before we [[Enact]] them. 

Each envisioned future is like a potential Plan of Action or Play that could be implemented. 

Ideally, we then choose, out of all the potential visions of our future, the one most positive and Good [[Vision]] to try to [[Enact]] and [[Realize]]. 

To be properly calibrated, these imagined [[Plans of Action]] must of course be relative to our [[Worthy Goal]].
