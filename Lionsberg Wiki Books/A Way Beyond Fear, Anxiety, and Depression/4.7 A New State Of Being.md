# 4.7 A New State Of Being

This [[Forward]], growing, elevating, transforming, progressing, co-creating, engaged, enthusiastic [[State of Being]] can become the state in which we exist most of the time, even in the midst of the [[Chaos]] and Catastrophe of [[Life]]. 

This [[State of Being]] and [[Flow]], moving in partnership with [[One]] and [[All]] towards [[The Goal]], co-creating our [[Reality]], is the most meaningful and rewarding State there is.   

It is an Object of Pursuit in and of itself. 

It is not just [[The Goal]], but our [[Way of Being]] as we advance with [[All]] Creation towards it. 

Is both [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]]. 

It is actually our [[State of Being]] that determines our [[Progress]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

We cannot get to [[Where We Are Going]], without becoming [[Who We Are Becoming]]. 

And who we are becoming is engaged, enthusiastic [[Conscious Agents]] [[Co-Operating]] and [[Co-Creating]] our [[Reality]] in [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] with [[One]] and [[All]]. 

If we [[All]] [[Help One Another]] achieve this [[State of Being]], we will be a paradise that is getting better every day because we are [[All]] working together to make it so.
