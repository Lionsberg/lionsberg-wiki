# 1.5 You Are Not Your Body. You Are Not Your Thoughts.

I use the terms [[Embodiment]] and higher [[Consciousness]] because, in order to rise above the chaos and suffering, you must learn to transcend your own suffering and realize that you are not your body, and you are not your thoughts.

You have a body.

You have thoughts.

But you are something different and beyond those.

Your [[True Self]] is far deeper and far higher than your body or your thoughts.

You are the entity capable of rising up, consciously observing, and guiding your body and thoughts.

From that highest perspective, let us examine your present embodiment and see if we can uncover the mechanics of what is happening, and how we can make some adjustments to the System.
