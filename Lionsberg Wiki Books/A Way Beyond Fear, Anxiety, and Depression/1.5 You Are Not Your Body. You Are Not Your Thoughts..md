# 1.5 You Are Not Your Body. You Are Not Your Thoughts.

I use the terms [[Embodiment]] and higher [[Consciousness]] because in order to rise above the chaos and suffering, you are going to have to learn to rise above your own suffering and [[Realize]] that [[You Are Not Your Body]], and [[You Are Not Your Thoughts]]. 

You have a body.  

You have thoughts. 

But You are something different and beyond those. 

Your [[True Self]] is far deeper and far higher than your body or your thoughts. 

You are what is capable of rising up and consciously observing and guiding your body and your thoughts. 

From that highest lens, let us look down upon your present [[Embodiment]] and see if we can discover the mechanics of what is happening, and how we can make some adjustments to the System.
