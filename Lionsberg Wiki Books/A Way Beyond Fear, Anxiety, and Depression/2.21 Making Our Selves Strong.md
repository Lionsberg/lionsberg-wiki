# 1.21 Making Our Selves Strong

It has been said that if you [[Love]] someone, you don't want to keep them safe. 

You want to make the courageous and strong. 

Safety is a fragile condition that is always, eventually, shattered. 

Courage and Strength are virtuous states of being that equip us to contend with whatever conditions, enemies, or obstacles manifest themselves. 

I am deeply concerned that the coming 7 years will be a very difficult time as we grapple with both planetary and societal consequences and transformations. 

Because I and [[One]] [[Love]] [[All]], equally and without exception, I am partnering with [[One]] and [[All]] to do everything in my power to lift up and strengthen [[All]] in preparation for all that is about to happen. 

Please, I beg you, do not wait until the reactions and transformations begin to strengthen your Self, your family, and your Community. 

If you need anything, please [[Let Us Know]] and we will do our best to [[Prioritize The Issues]], [[Meet The Needs]], and [[Solve The Problems]] that presence themselves to us. 

Now - It is time to begin gathering [[Energy]] and moving.
