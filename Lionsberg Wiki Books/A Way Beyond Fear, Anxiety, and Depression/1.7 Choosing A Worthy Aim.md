# 1.7 Choosing A Worthy Aim

The foundational step of establishing a proper relationship between our consciousness, brain, and Autonomic Nervous System is to choose a worthy aim or goal to pursue.

As we will discover later, this [[Worthy Aim]] can be scaled down to an astonishingly small size if necessary. While the amount of positive emotion you can experience is directly related to how much responsibility you take on and the worthiness of your goal, reaching those heights takes time.

In the beginning, all that matters is that you have a valued goal within your immediate reach that you can move towards, even if it is emptying an overflowing trash can or organizing one half of your desk.

The reason an Aim is so important is because we are inherently [[Beings In Motion]], moving away from pain, suffering, and dysfunction, and towards something [[Better]]. It is impossible to remain [[Where We Are]].

Our entire emotional and nervous systems are wired to help us [[Navigate]] this [[Quest]] towards our [[Goals]]. Just as it is extremely difficult to steer a parked car or balance on a bicycle or surfboard that is not moving, it is virtually impossible to be a balanced being if we don't know [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]. 

As long as we remain stuck, aimless, and goalless, we will remain mired in [[Negative Emotion]] and devoid of [[Positive Emotion]].

Understanding where we are going and why, and beginning to make some small [[Progress]] forward, no matter how small, is the key to establishing a foundational balance of being. This balance, in turn, allows the balance of energy in our Autonomic Nervous System to regulate itself relative to our progress and environment.

As progress manifests, positive emotion will begin to flow, and one small surge of positive emotion can lead to another if we keep advancing towards our goal.

At the end of this book, we will walk you through a simple process to choose the smallest positive forward movement you are capable of and willing to make, and how to use that tiny bit of progress to begin transforming the balance and flow of energy in your Autonomic Nervous System.

For now, let's develop an intuition for what it feels like to be in motion on a quest towards a small or large goal we value.
