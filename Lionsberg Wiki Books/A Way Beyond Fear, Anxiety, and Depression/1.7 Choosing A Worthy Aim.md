# 1.7 Choosing A Worthy Aim

The foundational step of getting our [[Consciousness]] and brain properly relating to our [[Autonomic Nervous System]] is to choose a [[Worthy Aim]] or Goal to advance towards. 

As we will discover later, that Valuable Goal can be reduced to shockingly small size if necessary. 

While the amount of positive emotion you can experience is directly related to how much responsibility you take on and how worthy your goal is, those heights take a while to climb up to. 

In the beginning, all that matters is that you have have some valued goal in your immediate proximity that you can move towards. 

Even if it emptying out one overflowing trash can, or organizing one half of your desk. 

This is because we are inherently [[Beings In Motion]] away from (pain, suffering, dysfunction), and towards (somewhere or something better). It is impossible to remain [[Where We Are]]. 

Our entire emotional and nervous systems are wired to help us [[Navigate]] on this Quest towards our goals. 

Just as it is extremely difficult to steer a parked car, or balance on a bicycle or surfboard that is not moving, so too is it virtually possible to be a balanced being if we do not know [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]]. 

As long as we remain stuck, aimless and goalless, we will will remain mired in negative emotion, and devoid of positive emotion 

Understanding [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]], and beginning to make some small progress [[Forward]], no matter how small, is the key to establishing a foundational Balance of Being, that in turn will allow the Balance of Energy in our [[Autonomic Nervous System]] to regulate itself relative to our [[Progress]] and Environment. 

As progress manifests, positive emotion will begin flow, and one small kick of positive emotion can lead to another if we keep advancing towards The Goal. 

At the end of this book, we will walk you through a simple process to choose the smallest positive forward movement you are capable of making and willing to make, and how to use that tiny bit of [[Progress]] to begin to transform the Balance and Flow of Energy in your [[Autonomic Nervous System]]. 

For now, let's develop an intuition for what it feels like to be in motion on a Quest towards some small or large Goal we Value.
