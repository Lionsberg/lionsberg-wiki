# 2.2 Conscious Agency

By differentiating our [[Selves]] from our [[Embodiment]], our thoughts, and the various potential future patterns of action we imagine...

...we develop ever greater levels of perhaps the greatest gift [[One]] has given us: 

[[Conscious Agency]]. 

We become empowered to Consciously decide upon and [[Co-Create]], out of the total set of all possible futures, the [[Best Possible Future]] we can imagine. 

The function of our [[Conscious Agency]] is to analyze this Total Set Of [[Potential Futures]] in the [[Abstract]] realm, and make a _conscious decision_ to attempt to [[Realize]] the one that seems most likely to [[Achieve Success]] and [[Avoid Failure]] relative to our [[Worthy Aim]].  

This allow us to assess likely outcomes and potentials of various patterns of action prior to implementation... 

....and "kill off" bad ideas and faulty plans of action in the [[Metaphysical]] realm...

...without them entering [[Reality]] and resulting in our failure / death in the Physical realm. 

This is why Wise elders have said that _without a Vision the people perish_. 

When we can consciously survey the total [[Configuration Space]] of [[Reality]], envision multiple futures and selves, and consciously choose the [[Best And Highest]] Vision to implement... 

We gain the clarity, freedom, and joy that comes with knowing [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Why]], and knowing that it is not only Good, but it is better in every way than the past we are leaving behind.
