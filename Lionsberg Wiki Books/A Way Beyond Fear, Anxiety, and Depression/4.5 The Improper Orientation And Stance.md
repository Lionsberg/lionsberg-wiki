# 4.5 The Improper Orientation And Stance

When our [[Being]] and [[Embodiment]] are improperly composed and disordered: 

- We are off balance  
- Our eyes are downcast  
- Our shoulders are hunched  
- Our spine is bent 
- We are Focused inward towards the ego / [[False Self]]  
- Our [[False Self]] is attending to its self  
- We are unaware  
- We are not paying attention  
- We are unconscious  
- We focused on the parts and missing the Whole  
- We are blind to what is emerging  
- We are missing the patterns, potentials, and cues  
- We are collapsing inward  
- We are spiraling down  
- We are embodying lower primal drives   
- We are punishing, blaming and shaming our selves and others
