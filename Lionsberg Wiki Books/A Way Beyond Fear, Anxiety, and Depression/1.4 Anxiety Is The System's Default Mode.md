# 1.4 Anxiety Is The System's Default Mode

It may seem strange, but what we experience as anxiety is actually the **default mode** of our embodiment. It is how we are wired as human beings. 

This is because our Autonomic Nervous System, which regulates subconscious and unconscious functions such as heart rate, breathing, gut activity, and sexual arousal, is a "Default On" system.

Its default mode is to be heightened and primed for action in response to [[Threats]] and [[Opportunities]] in our environment.

The physiology of being "heightened and primed for action" includes an elevated heart rate, shallow breathing, and a feeling of uneasiness in the gut.

It is only when the executive function of our brain actively "turns the dial" and dials down the system that we can relax into calmer states.

Understanding that anxiety is not unusual, but rather the default mode of the system, is crucial to learning how to properly relate to our bodies and minds. 

Beyond our basic biology, it is also the case that our society and world are in a state of relative danger.

So, we must grapple with a system that is by default "on", in the context of a social, local, environmental, and global situation of dis-ease. 

As I mentioned earlier, you are not alone.

It is not surprising that you feel anxious, depressed, or afraid.

This is how a human being would naturally feel based on our biology, and where we are.

What I hope we can learn together is how our higher [[Consciousness]] can intentionally interact with our brain and body to create a more balanced flow of energy that is appropriate to the context we are in, and useful to spur us on towards our [[Destiny]].
