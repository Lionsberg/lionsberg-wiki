# 4.14 Measuring Against Who And Where We Were

When [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]] is lifted up such a lofty place, to the [[One]] [[Absolute]] highest place, and we stand in [[Awe]] and [[Fear]] of Its immensity... 

...we must discover the [[Way]] to avoid being crushed by it. 

The [[Way]] to avoid being crushed by the [[Source]] of the [[Universe]] is to bring our [[Selves]] as close to it as we possibly can, while measuring our [[Selves]] not against its [[Absolute]] Perfection, but against [[Who And Where We Were]].   

What counts, both spiritually and physiologically, is not that we ever achieve [[The Goal]].  

What counts is that we can experience our [[Selves]] making [[Progress]] towards it. 

And [[Progress]] is experienced not relative to [[The Goal]] that lies beyond our ability to even conceive of It, but relative to Where We Used To Be and Who We Used To Be. 

We can't even [[Comprehend]] the [[One]]... but we certainly know Who and Where Used To Be, and the farther we progress FROM that [[Old]] State and Place of Being, TOWARDS the [[New]] and higher State and Place of Being, the more positive emotion and enthusiasm we experience. 

It is a cycle that exponentially accelerates as it spirals us up towards the heights of [[Heaven]], right here on [[Earth]].
