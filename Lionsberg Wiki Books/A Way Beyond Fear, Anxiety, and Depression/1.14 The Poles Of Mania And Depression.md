# 1.14 The Poles Of Mania And Depression

The inability of a system to wisely [[Target]], [[Imagine]], [[Differentiate]], [[Discern]], and [[Judge]] among the entire array of [[Potential]] aims, narratives, and [[Patterns of Action]] often corresponds to shifting towards an extreme point on the dual poles of mania and depression.

To discern the [[Wise Right]] [[Way]] forward, we must bring ourselves to a clear, balanced point of energy within our system.

In English, we often use the terms mania and depression to describe the polar ends of the energetic spectrum of [[Enthusiasm]].

In a manic state, we experience extreme positive emotion, enthusiasm, and intense interest and pleasure in nearly every potential self and story. This can lead to disaster by inappropriately motivating us to pursue [[Forward Looking Story|Forward Looking Stories]] that are delusional, unwise, or can lead us astray or into danger.

In a depressed state, we experience sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest and pleasure. This can lead to disaster by demotivating us from pursuing valuable and beneficial forward-looking stories that are immediately actionable, and would greatly benefit ourselves and the world.

We all have those poles present within us, and experience shifts along the axis.  

When we experience shifts more extreme than seems appropriate for the given [[Context]], it is often a sign that our dopaminergic system is out of balance due to the _relationship_ between our [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]].

Transforming our [[Internal Context]] and / or [[External Context]] is essential for bringing the system back from the brink of [[Chaos]] and into [[Proper Order]].

What is always within our immediate [[Domain of Responsibility and Authority]] and [[Conscious Agency]] is our [[Selves]] and our [[Internal Context]].

By elevating and transforming our [[Internal Context]], we can begin to take micro steps towards elevating and transforming our [[External Context]], which in turn elevates and transforms our [[Internal Context]]. This then allows us to take progressively larger and more powerful steps as our [[Being]] and [[Doing]], internal and external, reciprocally spiral upwards together towards their [[Best and Highest]] [[Potential]].
