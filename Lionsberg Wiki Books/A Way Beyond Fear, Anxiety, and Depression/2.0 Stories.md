# 2.0 Stories  

Conscious Integration, Alignment, and Agency are held together in our Minds and articulated through a [[Narrative Framework]].  

[[Thrown]] into a given [[Time]], [[Space]], and [[Context]], we generally have to answer fundamental [[Questions]] in order to orient our [[Selves]]. 

These questions look forwards and backwards, and revolve around both [[Being]] and [[Doing]]. 

They are something like: 

1. [[Where Am I]]?  
2. [[How Did I Get Here]]?  
3. [[Where Am I Going]]?   
4. [[Who Am I]]? 
5. [[Who Am I Becoming]]? 
6. [[Why]]?  

These questions thoughtfully answered form a cohesive [[Narrative Framework]] upon which we can hang all the other information in the Story. 

At a high level, we end up with a [[Backward Looking Story]] and [[Forward Looking Story]] that extend out from [[Where We Are]].
