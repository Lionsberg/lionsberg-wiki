# 1.13 Enthusiasm

The etymology of the word enthusiasm can be traced back to the Greek _enthousiazein_, based on _theos_ (God / a god), meaning 'to be inspired or possessed by God / a god.'

Physiologically, enthusiasm is characterized by ***dopamine-mediated positive emotion***.

Because of this, the enthusiastic pursuit of a meaningful and [[Worthy Goal]] is one of the greatest sources of pleasure and positive emotion we can experience during our brief time on Earth.
