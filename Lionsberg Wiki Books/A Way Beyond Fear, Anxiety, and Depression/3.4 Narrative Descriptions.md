# 3.4 Narrative Descriptions

As we [[Envision]] these various avatars Enacting various [[Patterns Of Action]], some of them might be compelling enough to describe.  

When we begin to describe the vision, we would begin "narrating" what is happening in our Mind's eye. 

As we narrate, we would be giving a written or spoken account of a series of connected events. 

The series of connected events described in narrative form is a [[Story]], in this case, a Forward Looking Story, or a Vision.
