# 1.3 Elevated Heart Rate, Shallow Breathing, Uneasiness in the Gut

Imagine yourself huddled under a blanket in your bed or on your couch.

Your heart is racing. Your breath is shallow and rapid. A sense of deep unease consumes your gut.

Feeling so heightened and miserable, you wish to crawl out of your skin and escape... anywhere...

In darker moments, that escape might even include thoughts of death, which, as dark as it is to admit it, seem more attractive than the misery and suffering you are experiencing.

It feels as if you're trapped in a wildly malfunctioning body, desperately seeking a way out.

There is a Way out that leads not to death, but to flourishing and abundant Light and Life.

What you are experiencing is the result of brain-body signaling between your mind and your Autonomic Nervous System.

If we can understand what is happening within this complex system and learn to interpret the signals, then we can discover the ***intervention points*** that initiate an ***inflection point***, and help us start spiraling upward - away from suffering and death, and towards greater energy, peace, joy, and life.
