# 1.3 Elevated Heart Rate, Shallow Breathing, Uneasiness in the Gut

If I walked into your room, I may see you huddled under a blanket in your bed or on your couch. 

You can feel your heart racing. Your breathe is shallow and rapid. In your gut, you are certain something is deeply wrong.    

Your body is so hightened and miserable your entire being wants to crawl out of your skin and escape... to anywhere...

...in the darker moments that anywhere includes thoughts of death that seem far more attractive the misery and suffering of what you are experiencing. 

It feels like you are trapped in a wildly malfunctioning embodiment, that some wya, any way, you must escape. 

There is a [[Way]] out that leads not to death, but to flourishing and abundant life. 

What you are experiencing is brain - body signaling between your mind and your [[Autonomic Nervous System]].  

If we can understand what is happening in this complex system, and how to interpret the signals, then we can discover the intervention points that cause an inflection point, and begin to help us start spiraling upward. Away from suffering and death, and towards greater energy, peace, and life.
