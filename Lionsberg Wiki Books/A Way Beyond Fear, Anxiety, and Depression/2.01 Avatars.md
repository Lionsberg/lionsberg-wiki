# 2.1 Avatars

The stories we imagine and tell our self have characters. These characters could be described as avatars. 

The word avatar has two connotations. The first is that of an icon, image or figure that represents someone, for instance in a video game. The second is the incarnation of a spirit in embodied form. 

When we imagine stories in our minds, or when we dream, our mind spins up avatars representing our selves and others. Often, these avatars are not necessarily "us" per se, but rather different potential "spirits" or patterns of action that we or others could embody.
