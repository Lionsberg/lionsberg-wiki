# 4.8 The Rewarding State And The Rewarding Goal

Understanding that dopamine is the currency that urges us onward in anticipation of [[That Which We Value]], and that our entire experience of [[Positive Emotion]] is dependent upon [[Progress]], there is no more important first step towards flourishing that making a [[Conscious Decision]] regarding what we [[Value]]. 

The choice of what we [[Value]] has two dimensions: 

- What [[State of Being]] we value the most 
- What [[Worthy Goal]], or [[Outcome of Doing]] we Value the most  

You will not be surprised to discover that in the [[Lionsberg System]] and in [[Reality]] there is only [[One]] possible answer. 

That is to become like [[One]], and do what [[One]] would do. 

When our [[Most Worthy Goal]] is [[One]], we are striving to become as [[Perfect]] as we can, by making our [[Reality]] as [[Perfect]] as we can.
