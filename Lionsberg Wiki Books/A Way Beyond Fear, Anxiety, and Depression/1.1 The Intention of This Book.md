# 1.1 The Intention of This Book

This booklet is intended to reach all the way down to the most fearful, anxious, and depressed person on earth, and provide a lifeline, that leads to a ladder up and out of the pit, that leads to a total set of infrastructure, that can empower you to set your feet on the path towards your destiny. 

That may feel entirely overwhelming right now - would you be willing to clink the Forward link below and read one more page? It may save your life. 

It may save our lives.
