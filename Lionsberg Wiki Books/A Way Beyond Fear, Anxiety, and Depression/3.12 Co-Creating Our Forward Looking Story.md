# 3.12 Co-Creating Our Forward Looking Story

Our Forward Looking Stories are co-created with the society and context that surrounds us. 

Ideally, we want to co-create a [[Forward Looking Story]] about [[Where We Are Going]] and [[Who We Are Becoming]]... 

...that works for us...

...works for our society...

...and pragmatically puts us in a position where we most likely to be able to confront and overcome the obstacles, and capture the opportunities, that are standing in our [[Way]].  

A significant constraint upon which of the total set of potential Stories we choose to [[Embody]] and [[Enact]] is the mandate that it has to be the Story most likely to actually work to accomplish [[The Goal]]. 

Our imagination can soar, and then must return to the very balanced, pragmatic point of a Story that _might work_ and can actually be Enacted. 

This requires the ability, of every Living System, to [[Target]], [[Imagine]], [[Differentiate]], [[Discern]], and [[Judge]] between the total array of [[Potential]] Aims, Stories, and [[Patterns Of Action]] that could be Embodied and Enacted.
