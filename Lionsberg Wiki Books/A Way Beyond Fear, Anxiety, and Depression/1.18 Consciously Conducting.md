# 1.18 Consciously Conducting

From this new or rediscovered place of [[Consciousness]] and Agency, we can resume properly conducting the Symphony of our lives and our world. 

Our [[Consciousness]] is able, with [[Practice]], to grow exponentially in its ability to Conduct and Orchestrate all elements of our Being and Embodiment. 

This Orchestration and Conducting is what allows the Properly Ordered Symphony to manifest. 

It is not one of control, but of Conscious integration and alignment in service of an overarching and uniting Goal.
