# 1.20 What Comes Next

I know it has been hard. I know you have been suffering. 

But what happens next in the Story is that we are going to rise above the chaos, come together, solve the problems, and progress towards our [[Worthy Goal]] and [[Best Possible Future]]. 

And we are going to do it by Helping [[One Another]] choose an [[Aim]], and identify and take the next step that we see we are capable of taking, that we are willing to take, towards that [[Worthy Goal]].  

That one small step will will create just enough positive emotion and energy to enable us to take one more small step. 

And then we are going to do it again. 

And again. 

And again. 

[[We Do Not Know]] and cannot possible imagine how high we might be able to go if we stay present with [[One]] and [[One Another]] and [[Progress]] in this [[Way]]. 

One step at a time. 

One moment at a time. 

Present [[Here]] and [[Now]]. 

Paying [[Attention]] to what is arising. 

Curious about what is Trying To [[Emerge]] in us and through us. 

Co-Creating the conditions for [[That Which Is Trying to Emerge]] to Emerge. 

We are All here. Together. 

Caught up in a Story that is far more epic and far greater than we can possibly imagine. 

What a wondrous adventure! 

Let's get moving together, by each getting moving our Selves.
