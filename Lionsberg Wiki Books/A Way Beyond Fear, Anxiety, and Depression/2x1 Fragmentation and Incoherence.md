It has been said _a house divided against itself cannot stand..  

It has been said _anything divided against itself will suffer and die_. 

This is true not only for organizations and institutions, but for us individually as well. 

As long as we remain stuck, aimless and goalless, we will will remain mired in negative emotion and devoid of positive emotion. 

If we do not have an overarching and uniting Story and Goal that coheres within itself all other elements, it not not possible to manage anything more than being blindly pulled about by our lower order drives and fragmented aims as they cycle through control of us. 

It is not possible to experience an abundance of happiness and positive emotion, that can only come from the perception that we are making positive steps forward towards [[That Which We Value]] the most. 

When we integrate our [[Personality]] in service and pursuit of a [[Worthy Goal]], our entire Being comes into integrity and coherence, and our Progress becomes far more clear.
