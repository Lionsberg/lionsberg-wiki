# Becoming a Warrior of The Way

[[Beloved Co-Creators]], 

Welcome to the Opportunity and Adventure of a Lifetime. 

Among the many Paths to the heights of [[The Sacred Mountain]] is [[The Way of the Warrior]].  

Warriors fulfill a sacred function in the hierarchy of [[InterBeing]], protecting, defending, liberating, and upholding that which We [[Value]] and [[Hold Dear]].  

The [[Lionsberg System]] transmits Wisdom, Knowledge, and Training in the Energetic, Martial, and Healing Arts as a Way to empower [[Practitioners]] to cultivate and channel the [[Power]] of the [[One]] to accomplish the Will and Intention of the [[One]]. 

This training is unique on Earth, unlike anything you will have experienced in the past, and is available exclusively to committed members of the LIONSBERG Community.

To transcend [[The Collapse-Ascension Nexus]] and bring forth a [[New Civilization]], a [[New Way of Being]] is required. 

This [[New Way]] must be encoded in a [[New Pattern Language]] that can be [[Polycentrically Instantiated]] relatively simultaneous by individuals, groups, and communities around the world.
