# **The Warrior’s Intermittent Fasting Protocol**  
_An Energetic, Metabolic, and Spiritual Optimization Protocol for Warriors on The Sacred Ascent_

---
## **Purpose**

The Warrior’s Intermittent Fasting Protocol is designed to:

- Sharpen the body, mind, and spirit.
    
- Enhance metabolic flexibility, mitochondrial efficiency, and energy clarity.
    
- Strengthen discipline, resilience, and mastery over hunger, desire, and impulse.
    
- Realign the Being with the natural rhythm of the Cosmos and the Divine Flow of SpaceTime.
    
- Prepare the Warrior for both peak performance and prolonged periods of scarcity, warfare, pilgrimage, or purification.
    

This is not just a nutritional protocol—it is a sacred rhythm of alignment with **[[Nature]]**, **[[Purpose]]**, **[[One]]**, and the **[[Way]]**.

### **Core Principles**

1. **Fasting is Freedom**: It breaks the chains of addiction to constant consumption and redirects energy to renewal and focus.
    
2. **Feeding is Fuel**: Eating is intentional and sacred—fueling regeneration, growth, service, and power, not indulgence or escapism.
    
3. **Simplicity is Power**: Complexity burdens. Simplicity liberates. The protocol is designed to be clear, efficient, and easily embodied.
    
4. **Ritual is Alignment**: Every fast and feast is consecrated with intention,  presence, and prayer.
    
5. **Adaptation is Essential**: The protocol must be tuned to your personal cycle, goals, season, and training level.

### **Daily Structure: Choose a 16/8 or 20/4 Window**

- **16 to 20 hours fasting**
    
- **4 to 8-hour eating window**
    
- Aligned with **circadian rhythm**, **solar light cycles**, and **natural energetic cycles**.
    

One large or two smaller meals a day within [[The Fueling Window]].

### **Example Daily Schedule (Solar-Aligned)**

- **06:00 – 12:00**  
    Morning hydration (spring/mineral water, optionally warm lemon water, Celtic or Himalayan Sea salt, coffee or tea)  
    Movement, meditation, breathwork, prayer, writing  
    Elements: cold plunge, dip in river or lake, sauna, sun exposure, etc.

    Continue hydration, supplemented with targeted herbal / plant-based infusions as needed or called
    
- **18:00 – 22:00 (Feeding Window)**  
    Single large sacred meal, or two small intentional meals  
    Feast with prayer and gratitude on nutrient-dense, high-vibration whole foods that have been energetically tested for health and coherence    
    Macronutrients guided by training load:
    
    - High protein (wild or regenerative sources)
        
    - Moderate healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, coconut, ghee)
        
    - Clean carbs ideally from root vegetables, quinoa, rice, fruit if desired

### **Weekly and Seasonal Enhancements**

- **1 Day/Week Extended Fast**  
    24–36 hour water or herbal tea fast  
    Optional dry fast for advanced practitioners  
    Conducted on a rest day or in alignment with spiritual work (often Saturday)
    
- **1 Day/Week Feast Day (Optional)**  
    Loosen the window for communal meals, celebratory ritual, or soul-nourishing abundance (often Sunday) 
    Feast without gluttony or lapse in Quality of Being—remain present, reverent, ready, and aware  
    
- **Seasonal Deep Fast**  
    3 to 7 days, ideally once per 90 day season.  
    Integrated with detoxification, meditation, and silence  
    Can include herbal parasite cleanse, colon flushes, or dry fast phases  
    Anchored around equinoxes, solstices, or initiatory thresholds
    
- **Initiatory Deep Fasts**
    7, 14, 21, up to 40(+) days. 
    These longer initiatory fasts should be undertaken with support and guidance where available

### **Training Integration**

- **Train Fasted**: Light to moderate exercise is done in the fasted state to enhance fat adaptation and sharpen mental clarity.
    
- **Break Fast After Training**: Feasting post-workout maximizes absorption and rebuilds tissue and vitality.
    
- **Electrolyte and Energetic Balance**: Add salt, potassium, magnesium, and herbs as necessary during fasted states to maintain hydration, energetic balance, and nerve function.
    

---

### **Spiritual and Energetic Alignment**

- Use the fasting window to focus awareness inward, strengthen inner flame, and transmute hunger into **will**, **devotion**, and **intention**.
    
- Use the feeding window as sacred ceremony—an opportunity to bless and integrate the abundance of Life on Earth into your Living Temple.
    
- Anchor all stages in breath and prayer. Fasting without consciousness is merely starvation. With consciousness, it becomes **alchemy**.

### **Forbidden Practices**

In the [[Lionsberg System]], everyone is Sovereign and Free. There is no Law but [[One]]. And yet - it is a violation of Our Highest Sacred Intention to knowing engage in practices that Harm [[Our Selves]] or [[Other Selves]].

- We do not poison Our Selves with things that will make Us sick, weak, and incompetent
    
- We avoid processed foods, seed oils, refined sugars, chemical additives, and every other poison
    
- We do not purchase or consume things that fuel antithetical systems (large corporations, degenerative agriculture practices, extractive economic practices, depletion of Nature, etc.)
    
- We do not engage in mindless distraction eating—TV, social media, or unconscious consumption
    
- We do not feed late at night—violates circadian harmony, digestive rhythms, and sacred dreaming
    
- We do not indulge guilt or shame—only feedback, re-alignment, and continuous improvement

### **Final Note**

This Protocol is not one-size-fits-all. It is a sacred rhythm to be **tuned to your unique Being, season**, **mission**, and **constitution**. Observe your body. Listen to Spirit. Fell your Energy. Adapt in Wisdom and Strength.

Remember [[Rule Number 2]]: 
*Do [[The Wise Right Thing]]  
at [[The Wise Right Time]]  
with [[The Wise Right People]]  
to [[Progressively Realize]] [[The Goal]].*

You are not enslaved to appetite or habit.  
You are a Warrior of the Way.  
You feast only when it serves the Quest.  
You fast *because* you are Free.
