# The Widow's Mite

Jesus was sitting in the temple courtyard observing people making donations to the temple treasury. Many wealthy people were making large donations, showing off their wealth and piety. But then, a poor widow came and made a very small donation, two small coins called "mites," which were worth very little. But Jesus praised the widow, saying that she had given more than anyone else because she had given all that she had, while the wealthy had only given a small portion of their wealth.

The story is often used to illustrate the concept of  giving meaningfully or giving sacrificially. It is a reminder that our relationship with God is not measured by the amount of wealth or material possessions we have, but by our willingness to give of ourselves and our resources to others. It also highlights the idea of humility and devotion, as the poor widow is praised for giving all she had in contrast to the wealthy who gave out of their abundance. It's a story that teaches about the importance of giving and the true spirit of generosity, it teaches the value of [[Sacrifice]], [[Humility]], [[Devotion]] and the idea that God looks at the heart, not the amount of wealth one may have.
