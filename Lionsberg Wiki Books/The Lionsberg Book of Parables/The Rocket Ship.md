# The Rocket Ship

_We had a dream._ 

_We were all sitting on a rocket ship, ready to lift off towards the [[New]]. You were in the cockpit with a few others, and many were frantically scurrying around, shouting, rifling through papers, checking calculations._ 

_You were calm. "[[Where We Are Going]] is so far beyond our ability to even conceive of it, we cannot calculate it. We do not even have a [[New Language]] for it yet. We can only Know it by experiencing it and allowing it to [[Emerge]] through us."_
