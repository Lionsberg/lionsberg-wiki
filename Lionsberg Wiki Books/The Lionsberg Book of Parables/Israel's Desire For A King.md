# Israel's Desire For A King

According to the Hebrew scriptures, as the prophet Samuel grew old his sons did not follow in the [[Way]]. 

They turned aside from the [[Universal Law]] of [[Truth]], [[Love]], and [[Justice]], and sought after [[Dishonest Gain]]. 

They accepted [[Bribes]] and perverted [[Justice]].

The tribal elders grew frustrated and distressed, and asked Samuel to appoint a king to lead Israel, “such as all the other nations have.” 

Before this time, the tribes of Israel had lived in the presence of the [[Creator]], and looked directly to the [[Creator]] as their King and [[[Central Organizing Relationship]]. 

In the [[Story]], the [[Creator]] tells Samuel: 

_“It is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected Me as their King.”.   

He instructs Samuel to warn the people that if they reject their [[Freedom]] and the [[Kingdom Of God]] in favor of the kingdom of a man, that king would eventually become unjust and rule over them oppressively. He would claim as his right the conscription of their children to make weapons and chariots, wage wars, and tend to his lands and his luxury. He would take the best of their goods and produce and give it to his inner circle. 

Ultimately, the [[Creator]] warns through the [[Prophetic Voice]], “you yourselves will become slaves.”

“But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” They said. “We want a king over us. Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and go out before us and fight our battles.”

The Story turned out exactly as the [[Creator]] had warned them. They became enslaved to the human [[Authority]] that they had placed between themselves and the [[Creator]], the only rightful [[King]].
