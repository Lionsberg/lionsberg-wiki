_A young girl was sitting with her family at a picnic when a curious bee began to buzz around her food. She jumped up and began screaming and swatting the air in fear. “I hate bees!” she shrieked._  

_Her father calmly guided the bee away, and told her “It is ok my love. You do not need to be afraid. Do not say that you hate the bees, we should Love the bees.”_  

_A short time later, after her panic subsided, the young girl looked curious and puzzled for a few moments, and then asked “But how can I love something that I am afraid of?”_
