# The Pastor And The Building

There once was a man who called himself "Pastor". 

His church was on a hill overlooking the ocean in a wealthy community. It was the largest and most beautiful church in the town. 

Many wealthy people became part of the country club, and family members and those who donated were offered positions of privilege and esteem. They drank, they smoked, they golfed, they cheated, and they relished their positions and power. 

They arranged a fundraising drive to build the building even larger, and asked the youth, the staff, and the poor to donate. They suggested all manner of creative ways for the young, the poor, and the old to give, such as stopping buying cups of coffee in the morning so they could commit the money towards the building. 

As the young, the poor, and the elderly sacrificed and gave, the fund filled up. 

The effort at coaxing the church to sacrifice was so successful that the man who called himself Pastor personally took $50,000 from the fund as a bonus.  

What should be done with leaders who heap up burdens on the young, the old, and the poor, which they themselves are unwilling to bear?
