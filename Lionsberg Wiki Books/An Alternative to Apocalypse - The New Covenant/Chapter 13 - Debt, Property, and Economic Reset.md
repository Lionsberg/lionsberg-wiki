# Chapter 13 - Debt, Property, and Economic Reset

#### **I. Introduction: The Nuts and Bolts of Jubilee**

The concept of Jubilee is a breathtaking vision, but how do we translate this ancient wisdom into modern practice? This chapter delves into the practical aspects of resetting debt, just distribution of property, and restructuring economic systems, all while navigating the complexities of our interconnected world.

#### **II. Resetting Debt: The Mechanics of Financial Liberation**

1. **Debt Forgiveness Programs**: How can we implement wide-scale debt forgiveness and reset without crashing the financial systems?
    
2. **Global Debt Relief**: How can we extend the concept of Jubilee to the international stage, relieving impoverished nations from the shackles of crippling debt and corrupt foreign interference?
    
3. **Collective Bankruptcy**: How can we recognize that we are mathematically collectively bankrupt, and spend the next 1,000 years co-creating a flourishing and abundant world, rather than going to war over who is owed what? 
    
4. **Cryptocurrency and Blockchain**: Could new technologies offer a transparent and fair way to reset debt and currencies in a decentralized way, while helping humanity avoid the centralized control of central bank digital currencies?
    

#### **III. Property Stewardship: A New Social Contract**

1. **Land Reforms**: The Jubilee tradition involves returning land to its original owners. What would a modern equivalent look like, especially in urban settings? How do we ensure that every tribe, nation, and people on Earth has a sovereign, autonomous homeland? How might greater decentralization of governance structures avoid the types of arbitrary wars over nation-state boundaries we are witnessing in places such as Ukraine? 
    
2. **Intellectual Property**: In a digital age, property isn't just physical. How can the Jubilee address issues like patent laws, open-source software, and creative commons? How can we ensure that the collective inheritance of all human Wisdom, Knowledge, and Insight is available to all God's children to build upon in the New Era? 
    
3. **Community Land Trusts**: Do mechanisms such as locally stewarded community land trusts offer a just pathway towards liberating local land from debt, and empowering local communities to steward and improve their own land over the course of generations?
    
4. **Generational Transfer of Business and Real Property Equity**: How can we co-create systematic mechanisms for the Wise, Just, Right, and Good transfer of accumulated business and real property equity throughout the generations? How might we responsibly deal with the trillions of dollars of wealth transfer slated to occur over the next 10 to 20 years, in a Way that creates an optimal playing field for All of God's children, and not just the children of a select few? How do we co-create this future such that it is genuinely better and preferable not only for the children of the poor, but also for the children of the rich? 
    

#### **IV. Economic Structures: Beyond the False Dichotomies of Unbridled Capitalism or Socialism**

1. **Universal Basic Opportunity (UBO)**: Could this be a stepping stone toward a Jubilee-inspired economic system? Could this be a pathway towards the total transformation of the welfare state, in a way that ensures that every citizen has the opportunity to engage in meaningful work that positively transforms their life and their world? 
    
2. **Cooperative Multi-Generational Business Models**: How can we encourage cooperative stewardship of business structures that prioritize long-term community benefit over short-term shareholder profits? How do we resubordinate capital as a mere tool to be used in service of our shared goals and values, and never as a master or ruler? 
    
3. **Resource-Based Economy**: Moving beyond money, how can we mimic Nature and allocate resources in a way that is genuinely non-transactional, regenerative and just?
    
4. **Economic Alignment**: How can we differentiate Waste and Value in our economic system, and incentivize Value Creation and Waste Reduction? How do we progressively realign our entire economic system *in service of* God and The Goal, while liberating it from corrupt and exploitative short-term self-interest? 
    
5. **Local Strength, Resilience and Stewardship**: How do relocalize and diversify our economic systems to restore local strength, resilience, and stewardship of economic futures? How do we enable interoperability and flow between strong localities, in a way that affords the abundance of trade, without creating centralized dependencies and fragilities? How do we relocalize food systems, manufacturing, and productivity through shared Wisdom, Knowledge, and Technology? 
#### **V. Case Studies: Models for Implementation**

1. **Iceland's Financial Reset**: How Iceland recovered from its financial crisis could offer insights into debt forgiveness.
    
2. **Gross National Happiness / Flourishing**: This alternative to GDP could align well with Jubilee principles, and shed light on measuring what matters.
    
3. **The Mondragon Corporation**: A worker cooperative that could serve as a model for a federation of Jubilee-inspired businesses that flourish under the New Covenant. 
    

#### **VI. The Challenges and Roadblocks**

1. **Political Resistance**: The most obvious challenge is the political will. How do we build a coalition broad and bold enough to implement such radical changes?
    
2. **Economic Constraints**: Critics will argue that the financial system can't handle such a reset. How do we illuminate the inevitability of collapse and war if we do nothing, and prove that a conscious and voluntary reset is preferable to a disorderly collapse? 
    
3. **Cultural Barriers**: The concept of Jubilee challenges deeply held beliefs about competition, accumulation and success. How do we shift the cultural narrative?
    

#### **VII. Conclusion: The Journey Ahead**

The path to implementing a modern Jubilee is fraught with challenges, both practical and philosophical. Yet, the potential rewards—a renewed society rooted in principles of Truth, Love, Justice, and Unity—are too great to ignore. As we stand at this critical juncture, we have the opportunity to rewrite the social contract, to redefine what we owe to each other and what we can dream together. The Jubilee is not just a lofty ideal but a practical and spiritually wise pathway to a world renewed, a world that reflects the highest aspirations of the human spirit in alignment with the Will and Intention of God.
