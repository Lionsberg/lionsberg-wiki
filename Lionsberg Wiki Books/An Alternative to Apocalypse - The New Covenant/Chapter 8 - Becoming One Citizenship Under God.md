# Chapter 8 - Becoming One Citizenship Under God

#### **I. Introduction: The Concept of One Citizenship Under God**

The notion of "One Citizenship Under God" extends the principles and values of the New Covenant into the realm of governance, social organization, and collective identity. It posits that our Ultimate Identity and Allegiance is not to tribes, politcal parties, nation-states, or other human-made structures and divisions, but to the Highest Divine Order that encompasses and unites all of humanity and creation. While it is important to celebrate and honor our lower order tribal and national cultures and affiliations, without a Highest Overarching And Uniting Identity and Citizenship we are destined to fragmentation, conflict, fear, anxiety, and failure. 
#### **II. Transcending Divisions: The Limitations of Earthly Citizenship**

Nationalism and tribalism, while serving as potent sources of identity and belonging, often sow seeds of division, conflict, and injustice. They can lead to fear, prejudice, exclusion, and a narrow understanding of citizenship that is bounded by geography, ethnicity, or ideology. The concept of One Citizenship Under God transcends these limitations by recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, irrespective of their other earthly affiliations. It is echoed throughout scripture in the idea that our primary Citizenship is in Heaven, where all things are unified in perfect harmony and fulfillment under God. As we begin to understand, enact, and embody this Highest Divine Order, Heaven descends and touches the Earth. 

#### **III. Spirit and Principles as the Basis of United Citizenship**

One Citizenship Under God is grounded in universal principles that are common to all of our most sacred wisdom traditions and ethical systems, because they are written on our hearts by the Spirit of God. These include Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, Goodness, Beauty, and Unity Under God. By adopting these principles, and on a deeper level the Spirit generating them, as the basis of our highest uniting citizenship, we create a powerful and united community that is united and bound not by borders and laws, but by shared Spirit, values and aspirations. Ultimately, we see that the True, the Good, the Beautiful, the Just, the Loving, and the Wise are unified by the Spirit of God, that longs to draw us all back into its Unity. 

#### **IV. The Rights and Responsibilities of Divine Citizenship**

Being a Citizen under God comes with both rights and responsibilities. The inalienable and Divine rights include liberty, justice, and the opportunity to pursue spiritual and material flourishing. The responsibilities involve upholding the principles of the New Covenant in all aspects of life, including social interactions, economic transactions, governance, and environmental stewardship. As "Children of the King", we are heirs not only to the full abundance and rights that are inherently ours as a consequence of our Divine Origin, but also the highest degree of responsibility to enact and embody the highest degrees of integrity, wisdom, and stewardship on behalf of God, as God's representatives here on Earth. This balanced approach to liberty and responsibility ensures that individual freedoms are harmonized with collective well-being across all generations of life, in service to God. 

#### **V. Governance and Leadership in a Divine Citizenship Framework**

In a world where citizenship is understood *primarily* as a divine right and mandate flowing directly from God to each individual, and reflected *secondarily* in our tribal and national citizenships and affiliations, governance and leadership take on new dimensions. Leaders are seen as stewards and servants of the people and domains they are entrusted with guiding, rather than rulers, and they are held up to Ultimate Spirit and Standard of God's Wisdom and Justice. In the Divine Order, the higher you rise, the less rights and the more responsibility you have, as it has been said *the greatest among you shall be the servant of All.*  Governance structures become more participatory, transparent, and accountable, reflecting the divine principles that underpin the concept of One Citizenship Under God, and the bright light of the Spirit and Standard of God illuminates, reveals, and vanquishes corruption and injustice. Additionally, governance and authority originate not from temporary earthly structures, but from our eternal relationship to God. From this starting point, we gain the freedom and responsibility to voluntarily organize our selves and navigate together towards The Goal of God, stacking up and aligning our efforts from the bottom-up. 

#### **VI. The Role of Faith Communities and Spiritual Traditions**

Faith communities and spiritual traditions have a crucial role to play in promoting the concept of One Citizenship Under God, and helping protect and preserve the wisdom, rituals, and practices that bind communities to each other and to God. By emphasizing the spiritual dimensions of citizenship and our Ultimate Oneness Under God, they can help foster a sense of unity and shared destiny across the lines that have divided us in the past. Dialogue and cooperation among different traditions around our supreme uniting identity, principles, and values become essential tools for building a world that reflects the highest Divine principles and ideals of the New Covenant.

#### **VII. Practical Steps Toward Realizing One Citizenship Under God**

Realizing the vision of One Citizenship Under God requires concerted effort at individual, community, and institutional levels. Practical steps include personal transformation, educational initiatives, policy change, legislative transformations, constitutional amendments, and grassroots movements that promote and embody the principles of the New Covenant. By working together in a spirit of unity and mutual respect, we can bring this transformative vision to fruition, one life, one family, one community, one tribe, and one nation at a time.

#### **VIII. Conclusion: The Promise and Potential of One Citizenship Under God**

The concept of One Citizenship Under God offers a revolutionary yet deeply resonant framework for reimagining our collective identity and purpose. It provides a pathway for transcending the conflict and divisions that plague our world, replacing them with a vision of unity, justice, and peace under the Highest Divine Order. As we embrace this highest form of shared citizenship, we create the potential, in partnership with God and One Another, not only to fulfill our highest spiritual potential but also to pragmatically address the urgent material challenges facing humanity and all creatures on Earth. 

By adopting the principles and values of One Citizenship Under God, we take a significant step toward realizing the New Covenant's promise of a world that honors the dignity of every individual, and the sanctity interconnectedness of all life.
