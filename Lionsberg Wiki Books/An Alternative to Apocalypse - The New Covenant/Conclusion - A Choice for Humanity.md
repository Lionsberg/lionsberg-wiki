# Conclusion - A Choice for Humanity

#### **The Voluntary Leap Forward**

As we stand at this pivotal juncture in human history, we are presented with a profound choice: to continue down our current path, fraught with division, exploitation, spiritual emptiness, and inevitable collapse and war, or to take a conscious and voluntary leap forward into a higher order of existence. This leap is not a blind jump but a conscious, collective decision to realign ourselves with the Divine principles of Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, Stewardship, and Unity Under God. It's an invitation to transcend our limitations and to co-create a world that retains all the best features and benefits of the previous order, while opening up significant new possibilities for human flourishing and Divine communion.

The leap forward is not a mandate; it's a choice. It's an opportunity for each individual, community, and nation to consciously opt in to a New Paradigm. This is not a utopian dream but a practical, achievable reality, made possible by the collective will of humanity aligned with the Will and Intention of God Who unites us. The leap forward is an act of free will, guided by Wisdom, and it is a testament to the human spirit's incredible capacity for growth, transformation, and transcendence, especially when faced the prospect of imminent catastrophe.

It is also an opportunity that cannot be achieved without a struggle. While it is unknown how much conflict and collapse we are destined to endure as a consequence of centuries of misguided navigation, we know that it is our battle to fight in partnership with God, and that the sooner we turn around and set our feet back on the path towards The Goal, the less suffering we and progeny will endure. We understand that a myriad of challenges and enemies stand in our path, but we also understand that those obstacles mark the Way towards our Goal, and that it is only by voluntarily confronting and overcoming them that we can become the kinds of people capable of co-creating the New World. 

#### **A Call to Action**

In previous moments of existential threat, we have worked together and marshaled our collective resources and will to accomplish seemingly impossible feats, such as safely landing a man on the moon over the course of a decade. 

At the crucial juncture in history, we now are now faced with the even larger challenge of landing humanity and our planet on a safe trajectory towards a flourishing and abundant future. It is perhaps the greatest challenge in human history - and it therefore contains within itself the greatest potential and rewards. 

The vision laid out in these chapters is not meant to be admired or criticized from a distance; it is a call to action. It is an invitation for each one of us to engage with these ideas, to contribute our unique gifts and talents to the co-creation of the New Era. Whether you are an artist or an engineer, a teacher or a student, a leader or a follower, you have a role to play in the grand symphony of co-creation and transformation that this moment in history demands. 

This is not a journey we undertake alone but one we embark upon together, as a collective, as a species, as children of God and stewards of the Earth. It's a journey that requires courage, commitment, and above all, Wisdom and Love. It is a journey that will challenge us, that will push us beyond our comfort zones, but it is also a journey that holds the promise of unparalleled joy, peace, and spiritual fulfillment, on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

As we close this book, let us open our hearts to the possibilities that lie ahead. Let us commit ourselves to this sacred endeavor, not as a burdensome obligation or a fearful undertaking, but as a Light and joyous opportunity to advance towards Unity with God and each other, and to set our world back in proper order and alignment. Let us rise to the occasion, armed with Faith, fortified by Hope, enveloped in Love, and empowered by the Spirit of God. Let us take this voluntary leap forward, not just for ourselves but for all of humanity, for all of Creation, and for the glory of God.

The choice is ours to make. The time is now. Let us step boldly and wisely into this New Era, and may we do so in alignment with the Divine Will, for the Highest Good of all. Amen.
