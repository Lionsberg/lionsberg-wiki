# Introduction - The Crossroads of History

In the vast tapestry of human history, there arise moments of profound significance, crossroads where the choices made echo through time, shaping destinies and defining legacies. At this critical juncture, humanity stands at such a crossroads, facing a choice between two paths—one leading to potential collapse and the other to renewal and flourishing.

The signs of impending crisis are all around us. Political polarization tears at the fabric of societies, economic inequalities widen, environmental degradation accelerates, and the specter of conflict looms large. The very foundations of the world order, painstakingly built over centuries, seem to tremble under the weight of these challenges. The path we are on appears to lead towards an apocalypse—a collapse of the systems that sustain life, liberty, and unity.

2,000 years ago, Jesus criticized the religious leaders of his time, saying “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."

As we pointed out in [[Most People Have No Idea What Is Coming]], the leaves are changing, the warning signals are flashing red, and most people remain asleep. 

Yet, this is not a message of despair, nor a prophecy of inevitable doom. For within the human spirit lies the capacity for wisdom, compassion, creativity, and transformation. We are not mere victims of circumstance, but co-creators of our destiny, endowed with the divine spark that enables us to confront and overcome whatever lies ahead, and reimagine, redesign, and rebuild a world of justice, harmony, and abundance.

This book is an invitation to an alternative path, a path illuminated by the reality of the spiritual war at hand, the principles of a New Covenant and the promise of a Jubilee. It is a call to recognize our interconnectedness with all creation and our responsibility to steward it with reverence and care. It is a plea to transcend the divisions that fragment us and embrace the universal values that unite us. It is a vision of a world where power is exercised not for domination but for service, where resources are reciprocally exchanged not hoarded, where peace is not a fleeting dream but a lived reality.

The New Covenant is not a mere abstraction or a utopian fantasy. It is a practical and moral framework, grounded in timeless wisdom and guided by the Spirit of God and the words of Christ. It recognizes the dignity of every human being, the sanctity of the earth, and the potential for human societies to reflect the divine attributes of justice, mercy, and love. It is a covenant that can be embraced by individuals, families, communities, tribes, and nations, transcending boundaries and bridging differences.

The concept of Jubilee, deeply rooted in ancient traditions, offers a tangible means to reset the imbalances that plague our world. It is a call for a just distribution of resources, a forgiveness of debts, a liberation from servitude, a restoration of relationships, and a renewal of hope. It is a bold and compassionate response to the cries of the marginalized, the oppressed, and the forgotten. It is a path towards healing, reconciliation, and a new beginning.

This book is not merely a theoretical exploration but a practical guide, a roadmap for action, and a toolkit for transformation. It is a co-creative endeavor, inviting you, the reader, to engage with the vision, reflect on the principles, and participate in the transformation. It recognizes that the journey ahead is not easy, that the spiritual war to vanquish corruption and injustice requires courage, perseverance, and faith. But it also assures that the victory is not only possible but promised, for the Spirit of God longs for humanity to avoid perishing and advance towards flourishing, abundant life, liberty, and unity.

As you embark on this journey through the pages of this book, may you be inspired and challenged, may you find hope and purpose, and may you discover the role you are called to play in both facing the harshest realities at hand, and co-creating a world that honors the Creator, respects Creation, and celebrates the Divine potential within us all.

The choice is ours, the moment is now, and the path towards a new era awaits. Let us walk it together, with faith, love, and a steadfast commitment to a future where every family on earth can enjoy a life better than any family on earth has enjoyed in the past.
