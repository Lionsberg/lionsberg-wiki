# Chapter 7 - Principles and Values of the New Covenant

#### **I. Introduction to the New Covenant**

The New Covenant represents a profound and transformative agreement between the Creator, humanity, and all creation. It is a call to a higher order of living, rooted in Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, Wisdom, and Unity Under God. It transcends human divisions, reaching into the very essence of what it means to be humans in Right Relationship, as part of the interconnected web of life.
#### **II. Truth**

Truth is the foundation of the New Covenant. It is the pursuit of what is real, authentic, and unchanging. Truth transcends mere facts or opinions, reaching into the realm of universal principles, eternal wisdom, and reality as it actually exists. It demands humility, honesty, integrity, and transparency in all dealings, whether personal, communal, or global. Truth is not something to be manipulated or compromised but honored and upheld as the guiding light of human existence. *For you shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall set you free.*

#### **III. Love**

Love is the heart of the New Covenant. It is not mere sentiment or emotion but a profound and selfless commitment to the well-being of others. Love recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of our differences. It calls us to empathy, compassion, and forgiveness, transcending barriers and building bridges. Love is the force that binds us together, the energy that heals and transforms, and the vision that sees the spark of the Divine in all. *God is Love. Love is the essence of the Divine.*

#### **IV. Justice**

Justice is the backbone of the New Covenant. It is the commitment to fairness, equality, and the rule of Universal Law. Justice recognizes that every individual has inherent rights and responsibilities and that these must be protected and balanced for the common good. It demands accountability, transparency, and the courage to stand against oppression, corruption, and exploitation. Justice under the New Covenant is restorative, seeking to wisely heal, reconcile, reintegrate and rebuild. *For the LORD is a God of Justice.*

#### **V. Stewardship**

Stewardship is the hands and feet of the New Covenant. It is the recognition that we are caretakers of the Earth and all its inhabitants. Stewardship calls us to regenerative living, responsible management, and a deep respect for the interconnectedness of all life across the generations. It recognizes that the Earth is not a resource to be exploited but a sacred trust to be honored and preserved for future generations. Stewardship is the practical expression of our spiritual and moral values, the tangible manifestation of our commitment to the New Covenant, and the embodiment of our understanding that the Earth and all it contains belongs to God. *The Earth is the LORD's, and all it contains, the world, and those who live in it.*

#### **VI. Wisdom**

Wisdom is the mind and soul of the New Covenant. It is the ability to discern what is wise, right, good, and true, not merely through intellect but through insight, intuition, and spiritual discernment. It is the ability to see from the Highest Perspective. Wisdom recognizes the complexity and nuance of life, the interplay of forces across time and space, and the long-term consequences of decisions. It calls us to humility, reflection, and a willingness to learn from both success and failure. Wisdom is the guiding principle that navigates us through the challenges and opportunities of life, leading us toward harmony, balance, and fulfillment. *Wisdom is more precious than gold, silver, and jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her.*

#### VII. Unity Under God

Unity Under God serves as the foundational principle of the New Covenant. It is the recognition that all of existence emanates from a singular Divine Source and Ultimate Reality, which is the ultimate standard and arbiter of Truth, Love, Justice, Stewardship, and Wisdom. This unity is not a call to uniformity or a negation of diversity but an acknowledgment of the inherent interconnectedness and sanctity of all life flowing from One Source, as God calls us back together by tribe. It is the realization that our actions, thoughts, and values have spiritual implications, affecting not just ourselves but the divine order of the universe. Unity Under God calls for a harmonious coexistence, mutual respect, a shared commitment to uphold the principles of the New Covenant, and a perpetual existence in Right Relationship to the Creator, One Another, and All Creation. *There is one body and one Spirit; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all. The LORD, our God, is One.*

#### **VII. The Potential to Transform Society**

The New Covenant is not a theoretical concept but a living reality with the potential to transform society at every level. By embracing the deepest wisdom, principles, and values that *cause* life and society to flourish in harmony, we can work together in partnership with God to co-create a world that reflects our highest ideals. 

This transformation requires a collective commitment, a global movement that transcends borders and barriers. It demands a reorientation of values, a shift from materialism, selfishness, and short-term thinking to a vision that honors the sacred and the eternal.

The New Covenant is a call to action, a challenge to each individual, family, community, and nation to rise to a higher standard, to forge a path that honors the dignity of all life, the sanctity of the Earth, and the interconnectedness of all existence flowing from One Source. 

#### **Conclusion: The Path Forward**

The New Covenant is both a promise and a responsibility, a vision and a path. It is the blueprint for a new era of peace, abundance, and harmony, grounded in principles and values that resonate with the deepest truths of human existence.

The choice is ours, the moment is now, and the path is clear. The New Covenant awaits our response, our commitment, and our courage to embark on a journey that will shape not only our own lives but the destiny of humanity and the future of all creation.
