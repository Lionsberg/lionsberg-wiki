# G. If one cannot keep humanity safe, one must make them strong

In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, it is becoming ever more challenging to ensure the safety and well-being of all people. As the guardians of ancient martial arts traditions, we recognize that while we may not be able to shield humanity from every danger, we can empower them with the strength, resilience, and wisdom they need to face these challenges head-on.

1.  **Developing Inner Strength:** By practicing martial arts, individuals can cultivate inner strength, which encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual fortitude. This inner strength allows them to remain grounded and confident, even in the face of adversity, and to respond to challenges with grace and wisdom.
    
2.  **Building Resilient Communities:** The principles of martial arts can be applied to fostering resilient communities that are capable of withstanding crises and supporting one another. By promoting a culture of mutual respect, cooperation, and shared purpose, martial arts can strengthen the bonds that hold communities together and enable them to adapt and thrive in the face of change.
    
3.  **Empowering Self-Reliance:** Martial arts training instills a sense of self-reliance and independence, teaching individuals that they have the power to shape their own destinies and overcome obstacles. By honing their skills and embracing the martial way, practitioners can develop a sense of autonomy and resourcefulness that will serve them well in navigating life's challenges.
    
4.  **Promoting a Culture of Preparedness:** Martial arts traditions emphasize the importance of preparedness, both physically and mentally. By encouraging individuals to train diligently and maintain a state of readiness, martial arts can foster a culture of preparedness that equips people to confront crises with confidence and determination.
    
5.  **Sharing Wisdom and Knowledge:** As the guardians of martial arts traditions, we have a responsibility to share our knowledge and wisdom with the world, particularly in times of crisis. By making these teachings accessible and relevant to modern life, we can empower individuals and communities to face the challenges of the present and the future with strength and resilience.
    

In a world where safety cannot be guaranteed, it is our duty as martial artists to help humanity become strong, resilient, and wise. By embracing the principles and practices of our ancient traditions, we can contribute to the creation of a strong and resilient world, even as we individually and collectively navigate the crises at hand.
