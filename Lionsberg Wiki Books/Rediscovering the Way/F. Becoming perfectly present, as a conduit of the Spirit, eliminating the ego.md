# F. Becoming perfectly present, as a conduit of the Spirit, eliminating the ego

As we recognize the importance of intention, discipline, and focus in our journey as Warriors, we must also strive to realize the end state we aiming at: becoming perfectly present, as conduits of the Spirit, eliminating the ego. This quality of presence allows us to connect deeply with the Source of our Consciousness and Being, enabling us to embody the principles of the Way, and become effective instruments for the Highest Intention and Greatest Good. By becoming present and transforming ourselves into conduits of the Highest Spirit, we can also transform the world around us, lifting it back up towards harmony and alignment with the Wisdom and Logos of its Source. 

1.  **Understanding Presence:** Presence is the state of being fully aware and engaged in the present moment, without being distracted or influenced by past memories or future concerns. By cultivating presence, we can experience life more fully and deeply, responding to situations with clarity, wisdom, and love.
    
2.  **Cultivating Presence:** Through meditation, mindfulness, martial arts practice, and other spiritual, intellectual, and physical disciplines, we can cultivate our presence, becoming more attuned to the present moment and the Spirit that flows within, around, and through us. This cultivation enables us to connect deeply with the Source and embody the principles of the Way.
    
3.  **Acting as Conduits of the Spirit:** As we become more present, we can serve as conduits of the Spirit, allowing the universal Energy and Intention of the One Generative Source to flow through us and guide our actions and existence. By becoming conduits of the Spirit, we become instruments of Truth, Love, Justice, and the Way, effectively contributing to the Highest Intention and Greatest Good.
    
4.  **Eliminating the Ego:** The ego is the sense of self that is separate and distinct from others and the Source. By becoming perfectly present and acting as conduits of the Spirit, we can transcend the ego, recognizing, experiencing, and ultimately becoming our interconnectedness with All Creation and its Generative Source. This progressive elimination of the ego allows us to act selflessly, ultimately realizing the [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] that will lay down even its own life in service of the Highest Intention and Greatest Good for One and All. 
    
5.  **Integrating Presence and Spiritual Conduitship:** As we cultivate presence and act as conduits of the Spirit, it is essential to integrate these qualities into our martial arts practice, spiritual transformation, and daily lives. This integration allows us to embody the principles of the Way, navigate life's challenges with wisdom and grace, and contribute to the evolution and flourishing of All Creation in partnership with its Source.
    

By becoming perfectly present, acting as conduits of the Spirit, and eliminating the ego, we become more effective Warriors and powerful contributors to the Highest Intention and Greatest Good. Through this presence and conduitship, we can transform ourselves, our communities, and the world around us, co-creating a reality of wholeness, unity, and flourishing, guided by the Spirit of Truth and Love.
