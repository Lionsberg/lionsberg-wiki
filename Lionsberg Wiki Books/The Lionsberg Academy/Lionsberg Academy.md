# LIONSBERG Academy

# Introduction

Believe it or not, this is a portal to a world class education for anyone in the world that can access an internet connection. For free.  

The Aim of the Lionsberg | Academy is to ensure that every person on earth has access to a world-class lifelong program of  learning and human development.  

As a starting point for anyone who current doesn't have a pathway to learning, we have curated together a lifelong learning journey by linking to external resources. 

We have bootstrapped up this availability primarily through five stages: 

- **Stage 1**: English Language as a key to unlock all available courses   
- **Stage 2**: Khan Academy as primary curriculum for early childhood development (Khan Academy Kids) through early college / AP courses   
- **Stage 3**: MIT OpenCourseWare to access the entire curriculum from one of the top universities in the world for free 
- **Stage 4**: The Lionsberg System and Community as the culture and context in which individuals, organizations, and communities can help one another develop towards the fullness of their potential and flourish in harmony  
- **Stage 5**: From this Starting Point, we will work together to continuously learn and improve all elements of the System  

This means that, through this webpage alone, anyone in the world with an internet connection can access the highest quality learning opportunities available on earth.
