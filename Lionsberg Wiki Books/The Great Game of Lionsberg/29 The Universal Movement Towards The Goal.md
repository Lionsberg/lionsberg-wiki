# 29 The Universal Movement Towards The Goal

As players awaken and embark on the Quest through The Great Game of Lionsberg, they work towards a singular, ultimate objective: The Goal. The Goal represents the realization of a harmonious, unified, and prosperous New World, where all forms of life and consciousness coexist in balance and harmony, reharmonized with the Source of All Creation.

The Goal is not simply an abstract concept but rather a guiding force that informs and inspires every aspect of The Game. Players who embrace the vision, principles, and values of The Game are actively contributing to the co-creation of this New World.

To reach The Goal, players must:

1.  **Commit to the Vision**: Dedicate themselves to the pursuit of a harmonious, unified, and prosperous future for All of Creation. This commitment involves understanding and embracing the values and principles that guide The Great Game of Lionsberg, and the Source from which it flows.
    
2.  **Engage in the Journey**: Actively participate in the various levels, challenges, and opportunities that The Great Game of Lionsberg offers. Players must be willing to learn, grow, and collaborate with others on their shared Quest towards The Goal.
    
3.  **Transcend Limitations**: Recognize and overcome the limitations and barriers that have historically divided humanity and other forms of creative consciousness. By embracing unity and valuing the diversity of All Creation, players can work together to transcend these boundaries and co-create a New World that works for All.
    
4.  **Embody the Values**: Live by the values and principles of The Great Game of Lionsberg in their daily lives, fostering a culture of harmony, unity, and love. By exemplifying and embodying these values, players inspire others to join them on their journey towards The Goal.
    
5.  **Celebrate Milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate the milestones achieved on the journey towards The Goal. Recognizing the progress made not only inspires further action but also strengthens the collective resolve to continue working in harmony towards the New World.
    

As players Progress towards The Goal, they become part of a universal community dedicated to fostering a harmonious and unified future for All of Creation across all Space and Time. This collective effort transcends the boundaries of the earthly realm, uniting players in a shared purpose and vision that has the power to reshape existence for the better, progressively bringing heaven to earth.
