# 7.3 Group-Level Challenges and Objectives

Group-level challenges and objectives in The Great Game of Lionsberg focus on harnessing the collective potential of the group to effectively address the complex and interconnected issues that characterize the Old World. Some of these challenges and objectives include:

1.  **Navigating Complexity**: Groups must develop the skills and capacities to navigate the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the transition from the Old World to the New World. This includes understanding the interconnections between different issues, adopting systems thinking, and remaining adaptive in the face of change.
    
2.  **Building and Maintaining Trust**: Trust is a crucial ingredient for successful group collaboration. Groups must work to create and maintain trust among their members, ensuring open communication, transparency, and shared accountability.
    
3.  **Resolving Conflicts and Disagreements**: Differences in opinions and perspectives are natural in any group setting. Groups must develop effective conflict resolution mechanisms that facilitate constructive dialogue, mutual understanding, and consensus-building.
    
4.  **Balancing Diversity and Cohesion**: Groups should strive for a balance between diversity and cohesion, ensuring that they benefit from a wide range of perspectives and experiences while maintaining a shared sense of purpose and unity.
    
5.  **Resource Mobilization**: Groups must effectively mobilize the necessary resources, including financial, human, and material assets, to support their efforts and achieve their objectives. This may involve fundraising, partnership development, and efficient resource management.
    
6.  **Scaling Impact**: Groups should seek to amplify their impact by exploring opportunities to scale their efforts, whether through replication, expansion, or collaboration with other groups and initiatives.
    
7.  **Meaningful Work**: Groups should ensure that their work aligns with the Vision and Values of the New World. This includes identifying opportunities to remove creative capacity from systems or organizations perpetuating the Old World and directing it towards systems and organizations that are co-creating the New World.
    
8.  **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: Groups must commit to a culture of continuous learning and improvement, regularly reflecting on their experiences, incorporating feedback, and refining their strategies and actions accordingly.
    
9.  **Developing Leadership and Empowerment**: Groups should invest in the development of leadership skills and capacities among their members, empowering individuals to take on greater responsibility and contribute meaningfully to the group's objectives.
    
10.  **Developing Appropriate Structures**: Groups must establish appropriate legal, governance, and process structures that facilitate their emergence and progress. This includes:

a. **Legal Structures**: Selecting the most suitable legal form for the group's activities, such as nonprofit organizations, social enterprises, cooperatives, or other models, taking into account the group's objectives, values, and legal requirements.

b. **Governance Structures**: Creating governance frameworks that reflect the group's values, promote shared decision-making, and ensure accountability and transparency. This may involve adopting consensus-based decision-making processes, establishing clear roles and responsibilities for group members, and implementing systems for regular reporting and review.

c. **Process Structures**: Designing and implementing efficient and effective processes that enable the group to carry out its work, manage resources, communicate, and collaborate with other stakeholders. This may include developing project management systems, communication platforms, and tools for tracking progress and performance.

By addressing these challenges and working towards these objectives, groups can effectively contribute to the transformational change envisioned by The Great Game of Lionsberg, playing a vital role in the co-creation of the New World.
