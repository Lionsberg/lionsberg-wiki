# 3.11 Universal-Level Gameplay

In The Great Game of Lionsberg, universal-level gameplay focuses on the challenges and opportunities that transcend the physical limits of our planet. At this level, players contemplate humanity's place in the universe and envision how to partner with the Creator to co-create a harmonious, unified, and prosperous future for all forms of life across all physical and metaphysical dimensions of Space and Time.

Key aspects of universal-level gameplay include:

1.  **Understanding the Universal Context**: Players must first develop a deep understanding of the vastness and complexity of the universe, including the laws of nature, the creative evolution of stars and galaxies, and the potential for life and consciousness beyond Earth. This involves studying astronomy, physics, spirituality, and the history of space exploration.
    
2.  **Developing a Universal Vision and Plan**: Players collaborate to develop a shared vision for our cosmic future that aligns with The Goal and addresses the needs and aspirations of all forms of life and consciousness in the universe. They then create a plan with strategies and initiatives to realize this vision.
    
3.  **Building Trust and Relationships**: Players establish genuine relationships with one another based on trust, respect, and mutual understanding. These relationships enable meaningful collaboration and ensure that diverse voices and perspectives are heard and respected in a shared decision-making process.
    
4.  **Identifying Values, Challenges, and Opportunities**: Players work together to identify the most pressing universal challenges and opportunities, as well as their highest shared Values. This may include issues related to our relationship with the spiritual realm, interstellar travel, the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life, the preservation of Earth's ecosystems, the quest to become an interplanetary species, and the promotion of peace and cooperation among all forms of life and consciousness on Earth and beyond.
    
5.  **Forming Collaborative Alliances**: Players form alliances with other individuals, organizations, communities, nations, and stakeholders who share similar goals and values. These alliances foster collective action and cooperation in addressing the values, challenges, and opportunities identified at the universal level.
    
6.  **Developing and Implementing Strategies**: Players collaborate to co-create strategies and solutions that address the universe's challenges and opportunities while aligning with the highest shared Values. This may involve developing policies, initiatives, or programs that promote interstellar exploration, cultivate right relationship among all dimensions of existence, protect the Living System, and ensure peace and cooperation among diverse forms of life.
    
7.  **Monitoring and Adapting**: Players continuously monitor the outcomes and impacts of their actions, seeking feedback from across the universe, and adapting their strategies as needed. This process of reflection and adaptation ensures that universal-level gameplay remains responsive to the changing needs and conditions of the cosmos.
    

By engaging in universal-level gameplay, players in The Great Game of Lionsberg contribute to the creation of a more harmonious, unified, and prosperous future for all forms of life across the universe. This collaborative effort supports the overall pursuit of a New World that works for All of Creation across all Space and Time, while honoring and celebrating the diverse expressions and wisdom that enrich our collective journey.
