# 1.8 The Governance Model - Citizen Led and Locally Driven

The governance model of The Great Game of Lionsberg is designed to be [[Citizen Led]] and locally-driven. It recognizes the importance of participatory decision-making, collaboration, and collective action in creating a more just and harmonious world.

Key aspects of the citizen-led governance model include:

1.  **Participatory Decision-Making**: The game prioritizes participatory decision-making at all levels, with citizens actively involved in shaping the policies and initiatives that affect their lives and communities. This ensures that decisions are grounded in the needs and aspirations of the people they impact, fostering a distributed sense of ownership and accountability for the outcomes.
    
2.  **Collaborative Governance**: The governance model emphasizes collaboration and partnership across all levels of gameplay, recognizing that collective action is essential for creating meaningful change. Players work together to co-create solutions, share resources and knowledge, govern the groups and communities they participate in, and support one another in achieving shared goals.
    
3.  **Distributed Leadership**: The game encourages the development of distributed leadership, where individuals take responsibility for the families, groups, and communities they are a part of, co-creating positive change within their communities and beyond. This approach empowers citizens to take ownership of the game's mission and values, inspiring them to become powerful agents of change in their own right.
    
4.  **Transparency and Accountability**: The governance model promotes transparency and accountability in all aspects of gameplay. This includes clear communication of policies and decisions, mechanisms for feedback and evaluation, and processes for addressing conflicts and resolving disputes.
    
5.  **Dynamic Governance**: The game's governance model is designed to be adaptive and flexible, enabling players to respond to changing circumstances and emerging challenges and opportunities as The Game and The Movement grow. This includes the use of agile and iterative approaches to decision-making and problem-solving, the willingness to experiment with new ideas and approaches, and an entire Lionsberg System purpose-built to transform and evolve across Time. 
    

By embedding these principles into the governance model of the Great Game of Lionsberg, the game creates a culture of collaborative and citizen-led leadership and governance, where everyone has a role to play in creating a more just, harmonious, and regenerative world.
