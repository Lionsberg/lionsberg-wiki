It encourages players to cultivate a deep sense of inner awareness, connectedness, purpose, and right relationship, fostering a deep commitment to the well-being of all life on Earth, and [[Right Relationship Between One and All]].  The game also promotes dialogue and understanding across the boundaries that have divided us in the past, embracing the diverse spiritual traditions and wisdom that inform our shared human journey, while honoring and upholding the core wisdom, principles, and values that keep us safe and united on our [[Quest]] towards [[The Goal]].
