# 3.7 Bioregional-Level Gameplay

In The Great Game of Lionsberg, bioregional-level gameplay focuses on the interrelated ecological, social, and economic systems that exist within a specific geographical region defined by its natural boundaries. At this level, players collaborate with others to address challenges and seize opportunities to create a more sustainable, resilient, and vibrant future for the inhabitants of the bioregion.

Key aspects of bioregional-level gameplay include:

1.  **Understanding the Bioregion**: Players must first develop a deep understanding of the unique ecological, cultural, and economic characteristics of their bioregion. This involves studying the natural boundaries, ecosystems, resources, and the historical and current socio-economic context of the region.
    
2.  **Identifying Values, Challenges and Opportunities**: Players collaborate with others to identify the most pressing challenges and promising opportunities within their bioregion, as well as the Values of its inhabitants. This process may involve analyzing environmental issues, social injustices, economic disparities, and cultural dynamics, as well as exploring potential solutions and innovations that can address these concerns.
    
3.  **Forming Collaborative Alliances**: Players seek out and form alliances with other individuals, organizations, and communities within the bioregion who share similar goals and values. These alliances foster collective action and cooperation in addressing the values, challenges and opportunities identified within the bioregion.
    
4.  **Developing a Bioregional Vision and Plan**: Players work together to create a shared vision for their bioregion, which encompasses the desired ecological, social, and economic outcomes. This vision then serves as the foundation for developing a comprehensive plan that outlines the strategies, actions, and resources needed to achieve these outcomes.
    
5.  **Developing and Implementing Strategies**: Players work together to develop and implement strategies that promote ecological stewardship, social justice, and economic vitality within their bioregion. This may involve designing and executing projects, initiatives, or policies that address specific issues or harness the unique strengths of the bioregion.
    
6.  **Monitoring and Adapting**: Players continuously monitor the outcomes and impacts of their actions and adapt their strategies as needed. This process of reflection and adaptation ensures that bioregional-level gameplay remains responsive to the changing needs and conditions within the bioregion.
    

By engaging in bioregional-level gameplay, players in The Great Game of Lionsberg contribute to the creation of a more regenerative, resilient, and vibrant future for their bioregion. This collective effort not only benefits the inhabitants of the bioregion but also supports the overall pursuit of a harmonious, unified, and prosperous New World that works for All of Creation across all Space and Time.
