# 2.8 Built to Transform - The Game's Progression and Continuous Improvement

The Great Game of Lionsberg is designed to foster transformation, both at an individual, collective and systemic level. The game's progression and continuous improvement mechanisms ensure that players are always evolving, learning, and growing as they co-create the [[New World]], and that The Game grows and evolves with them across the generations. 

Key elements of the game's progression and continuous improvement include:

1.  **Adaptive Learning**: The game is designed to provide players with ongoing feedback and opportunities for reflection and growth, enabling them to continually refine their strategies, actions, and commitments.
    
2.  **Mastery**: As players progress in the game, they develop new skills, knowledge, and competencies, which enable them to take on greater challenges and contribute more effectively to the creation of the [[New World]].
    
3.  **Collaborative Learning**: Players are encouraged to share their experiences, insights, and best practices with others, fostering a culture of collective learning and mutual support.
    
4.  **Iterative Development**: The game itself is designed to evolve and improve over time, as players contribute their ideas, innovations, and feedback to the game's development process.
    
5.  **Expansion**: The game's growth and impact expand as more players join and contribute to the movement, creating a ripple effect of positive change throughout the world.
    
6.  **Resilience**: The game's continuous improvement mechanisms ensure that the movement can adapt and respond to changing circumstances, challenges, and opportunities, ensuring its long-term viability and success.
    

By incorporating these elements, The Great Game of Lionsberg creates an environment where players are constantly challenged, supported, and inspired to grow, learn, and contribute to the co-creation of the [[New World]]. This ongoing process of transformation and improvement not only benefits the individual players but also helps to build a more resilient, adaptive, and powerful movement capable of driving lasting positive change.
