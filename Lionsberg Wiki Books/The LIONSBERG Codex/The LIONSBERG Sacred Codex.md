# The LIONSBERG  Codex

**A Living Compendium of Divine Intention, Deep Wisdom, Universal Logos, and Natural + Civilizational Regeneration**
# **Opening Declaration**

**This is The Codex.**  
The Whole within which all other Works are nested, and Beyond which they continually rise Liberated and Free. 

It is a **Living Revelation**, not from any one, but within and through Us All—  
Not to coerce, but to invite. 
Not to impose, but to liberate.  
Not to control, but to harmonize.  
Not to rule, but to regenerate and restore.  

Not as anything New, but as something Universal, Eternal, and True, whose **ReMemberance** **inbreaks** and **displaces** the [[Old]]. 

It arises at The Edge of The End, and the New Dawn of the New Beginning—  
A Guide and a Guardrail  
For the ReBirth of a New World  
The Co-Creation of a New Civilization  
And the Divine ReMembrance of Who We Are, Always Have Been, and Always Will Be.

It is an **Invitation to Alignment, Harmony, Coherence, and Flow**.  
A Mirror of **The Pattern**.  
A Transmission from **The Source**.  
A Key to exit **The Old Cages**.  
A Doorway into **The New Covenant**. 
A Way beyond **The Boundary**. 
A Path of Action. 
A Way of Being.  
A Sacred Flame of ReMembrance.
