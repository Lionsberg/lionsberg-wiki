# Scene 15 - Writing In The Spirit

Finally, after much hesitation and reluctance, Xion agreed to do his best to partner with the Spirit and convey the Logos of the New Vision and Plan. "Take your pen, take your paper, connect your consciousness and spirit as deeply as you can to their Source, and write," the Spirit urged him.

Xion picked up his pen and paper, and as he wrote, it seemed as though the words were writing him. Visions and ideas burst in and flooded his consciousness, and the Spirit guided his hands. For hours, Xion fervently recorded the intricate details and logic of the New Vision and Plan.

Throughout the process, Xion experienced a deep sense of clarity and purpose. He could see the New and More Perfect World taking shape in his mind eye, and he could feel the Spirit articulating through him. He was certain he was on the right path, following the Spirit's guidance. It was a profound feeling of meaning, exhilaration, and adventure unlike anything he had ever encountered before. 

Once finished, Xion set down his pen and examined the paper. He marveled at the words that seemed to have written him and was filled with a sense of awe and wonder. He had never felt so alive and connected to the Spirit. It felt like coming home after a long and difficult journey. 

With the Spirit's help, Xion had documented the Logos of the Vision and the Plan. Now, he simply had to speak and trust, and allow the New World to manifest itself through the Spirit and Power of God.
