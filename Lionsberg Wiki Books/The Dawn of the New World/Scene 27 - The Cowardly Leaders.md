# Scene 27 - The Cowardly Leaders

Upon their victorious return, the Forces of Good were appalled to find the political and religious leaders hiding behind the walls of the Boundary, having abandoned their people to fight alone. Dragged into the community square by the angry mob, they were confronted by Xion, his eyes blazing with righteous fury.

He spoke of their betrayal, their cowardice, and declared that their reign was over. The people called for the leaders' deaths, but Xion, with the Sword of Truth in hand, offered them a choice: sincerely seek forgiveness, atone for their actions, and abide by the New Law, or leave through the Threshold and seek refuge in the Unknown.

Faced with these options, the Old leaders vowed to abide by the New Law and pledged to dedicate their lives to serving the people in exchange for mercy and forgiveness. As forgiveness was extended, some leaders fled towards the Threshold. Xion stopped the warriors who gave chase, reminding them that all shared in the guilt for the Old society and that Justice should be left to God. They had all been complicit in co-creating the Reality that almost destroyed them. The people rejoiced, knowing a New Era of Mercy and Justice for All had begun.

As the day drew to a close, Xion and the Force For Good surveyed the state of Earth. By taking the risk of crossing the Threshold into the Unknown to confront and overcome the Forces Of Darkness outside their walls, the town had largely been spared. That first night of the New Era, they ensured that everyone had a safe place to sleep, they stationed guards and watchmen on The Walls, and for the first time in years, the families slept with their gates and shutters open.Â 

As the sun set, Xion made his way back up to the highest place on the ramparts, where the Spirit had brought him and lifted him alone. Alone, he fell on his knees, wept, and prayed. He knew that great challenges and opportunities still lay ahead, but that the Spirit would always be with them to show them the Way towards [[Heaven On Earth]].
