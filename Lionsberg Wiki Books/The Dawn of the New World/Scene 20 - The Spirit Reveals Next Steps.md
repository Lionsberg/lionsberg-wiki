# Scene 20 - The Spirit Reveals Next Steps

As Xion prayed in his secret room, the Spirit unveiled the next steps of The Plan. He now recognized that the society's leaders were hopelessly corrupt and seemingly possessed by the same cold energy he had felt radiating from The Monsters arrayed beyond The Boundary. The entire community would collapse under the weight of Evil if they did not hear the Words of Truth and rise together as One Living Embodiment of the Spirit of God.

Xion understood that reaching the majority of the society with the Vision and Plan would be an arduous task. However, he was determined to take the necessary risks, even if it meant endangering his own life. He knew that the Forces of Darkness were formidable, but he also trusted the Spirit's guidance and knew that the Plan was from God. 

Xion spent hours devising a system that would allow him to broadcast the Words of Truth to the Citizens from his hidden room in The Boundary. The system would enable him to communicate directly and discreetly with individual members of the society, and to distribute messages to the entire community.

Xion spent the rest of the day in his secret room, carefully planning out his strategy. He knew that the Vision and Plan would be rejected by the vast majority of society at first, perhaps over 99%, but he also knew that there were a few who could hear and see and understand. If he could reach those few, and they Resonated with The Spirit and Vibration of his message, then they could find the words to spread the message to [[The First 1,000]], and The First 1,000 could reach [[The First Three Percent]] of society who would be able to listen and hear.  If 3% could listen and hear, then 13% would be able to listen and hear. And if 13% could listen and hear, then the majority of the society, those who were not entirely corrupted, would follow quickly. 

As night fell, Xion could hear the guards still searching for him, but he knew that he was safe in his secret room. He continued to pray and plan, waiting for the opportune moment to begin his mission. He worked, he prayed, he wrote, and eventually, he slept.
