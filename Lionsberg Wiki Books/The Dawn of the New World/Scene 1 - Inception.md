# Scene 1 - Inception

In the beginning, the universe was an immense void, a vast expanse filled with only darkness, silence, and the [[One]] uncaused cause of [[All]] that was to come. 

[[All]] things had yet to come into existence, and nothing existed except the boundless [[Potential]] within the [[Mind]] of the [[Creator]].

Silent and formless, solitary and eternal, the Creator's presence was the only constant amidst the infinite chaotic stillness.

The universe knew no Time, no Form, and no Life, except for what was being conceived in the Mind of the Creator.

Out of this emptiness, the Spark of Divine Imagination emerged, fragile at first, but quickly growing and expanding, filling the universe with [[Light]], Color, and Love. 

This Spark gave birth to the [[Logos]], and the Logos revealed the Words. As these Words were chanted, the [[Universe]] of [[Potential]] danced and played into Form.

The stars were the Creator's first creations, shining brightly in the darkness. They blazed with a light both fierce and beautiful, illuminating the universe with their radiance. Each star, unique and powerful, was born from the power of imagination and would light the darkness for eternity.

Next came the planets, each breathtaking and distinct. Some were covered in vast oceans that would eventually teem with life, while others were scorched and barren, their surfaces scarred by the heat of their parent stars. Yet even these desolate worlds possessed their own beauty, with towering mountains and deep, mysterious canyons and caves. Even the most barren and hostile planets were Alive. 

The spark of Divine Imagination continued to grow, speak, and create, giving birth to ever more wondrous [[Phenomena]]. Galaxies swirled and danced in the darkness, vast collections of stars bound together by gravity and the power of Imagination. Within these galaxies, nebulaic star nurseries multiplied and abounded, glowing with the light of the newborn stars they nurtured. 

And then there came the beings, great and small, each possessing its own unique spirit, thoughts, hopes, fears and dreams. Some were meek and unassuming, while others were mighty and awe-inspiring. They inhabited a universe of wonders, brought to life by the Divine Spark of Imagination, woven together into the Cosmic Tapestry of Emergent Coherence, struggling against the forces of Entropy continually threatening to tear then asunder.

The radiance of Spirit and Imagination from the Creator was the source of All [[Creation]], forever inspiring and guiding the universe towards its [[Destiny]].
