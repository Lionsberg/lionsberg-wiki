# Scene 30 - The New World in Harmony

The New World was completely designed and built in harmony with the Logos of the Vision and Plan, from the highest level concept to the lowest level detail. Every aspect of society was permeated by the spirit of Truth, Love, Justice, Wisdom, and Stewardship. Because the Logos of the Vision and Plan was the Logos of the Universe, the people now lived in harmony and balance with the natural world, with each other, and with God. 

Using their newfound knowledge, resources, and technologies, they created a world more perfect than they ever could have imagined. The New technologies allowed them to leave behind the Old technologies that had polluted their world, and the River of Life began to run clear again for the first time in generations.

Soon, beautiful new buildings reached up towards the sky, and lush green forests stretched out as far as the eye could see. They created incredible machines that could do the work of a thousand men, and they harnessed the power of the sun, wind, and water to provide abundant regenerative energy to their communities.

They also created new forms of transportation that allowed them to travel quickly and easily between the cities of the New World. The roads were smooth and straight, and the vehicles were sleek and fast. They even built airships that could travel to the farthest corners of Earth, and navigate ever farther out into the Unknown expanses Beyond.

As they worked together to build the New World, they also created new systems of governance that ensured everyone had a voice in the decisions that affected their lives and that everyone was treated fairly and with respect. They instituted new safeguards that ensured the government could never again be co-opted by a corrupted elite.
  
Because the people were now governing themselves and working together for the greater good, they were able to begin rolling back the oppressive laws and regulations that had built up due to the previous moral failings of their society.

A vast array of small groups and organizations worked together to Progressively Realize the Vision and Plan, using their unique talents and abilities to co-create a world that was continuously getting better for everyone.

They also created a new system of education, one that focused on creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, and cultural and spiritual development. Through the new system, children of all ages engaged from youth in meaningful projects to solve problems around them, create amazing new things, and work together to make their community a better place. Even the elders regained their love for learning, and all generations helped one another learn, progress and grow. 

The New legal system was based on restorative justice, rather than punishment and vengeance. The prisons were progressively emptied, and Citizens were healed, forgiven, restored, and reintegrated into society in a strong, loving, and accountable Way. 

The economy was based on long-term regenerative abundance, right relationships, and cooperation, rather than greed and exploitation.

The monetary system was realigned with universal values, liberating the community from the artificial scarcity that had been plaguing them.

The arts and sciences flourished, as people were free to pursue their passions and talents without fear of persecution or suppression.

The New World was a place where everyone had the opportunity to develop towards their full potential and to live a life of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. It was a world that was free from the corruption and evil of the Old World, and one that was truly worth fighting for.
