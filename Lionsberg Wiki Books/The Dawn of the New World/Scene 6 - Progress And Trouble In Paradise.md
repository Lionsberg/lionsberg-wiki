# Scene 6 - Progress And Trouble In Paradise

As generations passed, the people of Earth continued to expand and develop their community. Infrastructure flourished, with roadways and bridges connecting homes and towns. Buildings reached for the sky, and tunnels pierced the mountains. Generation after generation, they fortified The Boundary to protect themselves from the Threats of the Unknown.

Earth became like a mighty fortress, a sanctuary where the community worked, played, and thrived in safety and security. They enjoyed the fruits of their ancestors' labor and took pride in planting seeds for future generations. They celebrated their traditions and cultures, passing on the torch of wisdom and knowledge.

However, not everything was perfect in the Walled Paradise. Earth's sanctuary began to show signs of fragility, and tensions began to rise in the community. Natural disasters increased in frequency. Water levels and weather patterns began to change. Strange diseases drifted invisibly through the air. Creatures and mysteries from beyond The Boundary found their way through the cracks in the walls that were starting to appear. The people discovered that no matter how strong or tall they built the walls, Existential Threats still crept in. It seemed there was always a Serpent in the Garden. 

Most terrifying of all, the Monsters and Dragons, once confined to ancient stories and the vast Unknown, now seemed to rise from within and without simultaneously. The community was perplexed, for The Boundary's walls were stronger and taller than ever, and the fierce winged lions stood guard. Yet danger and darkness encroached upon them. The people grew anxious and fearful, wondering how such darkness was infiltrating their community.

As fear consumed them, the people turned inward, and [[SpatioTemporal Domain]] of Concern tightened. Soon, everyone focused inward on their immediate struggles, allowing the stories of the heroes who ventured beyond The Boundary to fade ever further from their minds. The cracks in The Boundary, once small, grew larger until one day that seemed like any other, the Upward Spiral ceased, and the Downward Spiral began.  Â
