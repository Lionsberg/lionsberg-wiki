# Scene 3 - The Boundary


Over time, they organized their growing community and built walls to keep existential [[Threats]] at bay. With each generation, the walls grew taller and stronger, separating the [[Known]] territory within from the [[Unknown]] territory [[Beyond]]. They named their community [[Earth]], and they called the walls [[The Boundary]]. 

As the years passed, the [[Community]] flourished. They built homes and farms and established [[Rules]] and [[Laws]] to govern their emerging [[Society]]. The growing walls worked tirelessly to keep out the dangerous creatures lurking in the wilderness. The Boundary provided [[Safety]] and [[Security]], allowing the people of Earth to live in [[Peace]].

Within The Boundary there was a gate known as the [[Gate Of Knowledge]] that allowed people to pass in and out of the community. It was carefully guarded by fierce winged lions who kept strict watch over the gate, and who were charged with keeping the children in and the Existential Threats out. 

As Earth's community grew and prospered, the people became increasingly isolated from the world outside The Boundary. Each subsequent generation knew less about what lay [[Beyond]]. This did not concern them, and they lived in happiness and contentment within their protected community. 

Unbeknownst to them, a dark shadow was growing in the vast expanses Beyond The Boundary. A terrible threat was approaching, one that would challenge the people of Earth like never before.
