# Scene 31 - A Bright Future

What was most amazing of all about the New World was not how perfect it was becoming, but that no matter how perfect it got, it continued to get a little better every day because all of its citizens were striving together in harmony to make it so.

Liberated from the threats that formerly pressed in upon them, they were free to once again devote greater attention to the highest order issues, like healing, protecting, and nurturing their culture and environment so that all generations of life could flourish. As the air, water, and soil were healed and cleaned, animals and plants began to thrive again, and creatures they had not seen for generations began to return to Earth. The people of Earth welcomed and cultivated this new and abundant life, now that they remembered they were not separate from the natural world, but a part of it, and that the life of every living creature enriched and nourished their own.
  
In the New World, the people were free to pursue their dreams, passions, and interests. Everyone was treated with dignity and respect. The people of the New World were free to express themselves, to learn, and to grow. They were encouraged to be creative, innovative, and curious.

In the New World, the people were connected to the Creator, to each other, and to all of creation. They understood that they were part of something larger than themselves, and they were grateful for the blessings that they had been given. They lived in gratitude, love, and joy. The people of the New World were at peace, and they were happy and free. 

As they learned to place the Creator at The Center and base everything on Love, day by day, Earth grew ever more perfect and Good.
