# Scene 10 - The Seeds of the Resistance

In various corners of the community, groups of young people began to gather and discuss how their lives were unfolding within The Boundary. They shared stories of injustice, the heavy hand of the corrupt and impotent leaders, the rising desperation in the streets, and the mounting darkness that threatened to consume their world. Though still in their youth, their eyes were open to the suffering around them, and they longed for something better. Surely this was the Destiny they were born for. 

At night, the rising youth would cross the boundaries of their neighborhoods, huddle together in secret, and dare to voice their concerns and dreams of a Brighter Future. They questioned the power structure, the actions of the leaders, and the status quo that had been ingrained in their society of Earth for so long. Their courage and determination were planting the seeds of the coming uprising, as more and more bright young minds began to question the world around them, and imagine how they would like the world to Be. 

The shared feeling of inspiration and discontent among the youth fueled their passion to make a change. They started to organize themselves, forming a loose network of resistance groups. They pledged to support each other and to stand together in their Quest towards a Better Future. The bonds they formed in these secret meetings were unbreakable, and the Spirit of their determination began to grow stronger with each passing day. They would not simply stand by quietly while their world collapsed in on them. 

The youth also began to seek out information and knowledge that had been kept hidden from them. In the secret rooms and dark storehouses of the Libraries, they rediscovered ancient texts and stories of a time when Earth was full of love, hope, harmony, unity and courage. The more they learned, the more they were convinced that their future was being betrayed by the corrupted leaders, that a Brighter Future was not only possible, but their Destiny and Birthright, and that it was their duty to awaken, arise, unite, and fight to reclaim their Collective Inheritance.
