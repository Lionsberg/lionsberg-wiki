# Scene 24 - The New Vision Spreads

As the movement grew, small groups began gathering in secret to discuss the New Vision and Plan and prepare for action. The movement was especially powerful among The Youth, who were not as thoroughly brainwashed by the Old Authorities. Copies of the New Vision and Plan were distributed throughout Earth using a revolutionary technology, securely and locally stored within each group to ensure access to the information, even if the corrupt forces within The Boundary or the Forces Of Darkness outside the boundary disrupted communications.

They knew that the corrupt leaders and the Forces Of Darkness were reacting violently to the New Vision and Plan, and that each of them faced persecution and even death for their actions. Despite this, they were determined to confront and overcome the Darkness and forge a New World, free from corruption and injustice, and united in the service of the highest intention and greatest Good.Â They could clearly see [[The Promised Land]], but they also understood that they had to confront and overcome [[The Wilderness]] and [[The Giants]] in order to enter into it. 
  
Each small autonomous team worked together to develop unique strategies and supporting action plans, outlining their contributions to the [[System Wide Master Plan]] and methods for spreading [[The Message]] to [[The Next 1%]] of the population in accordance with the [[Tipping Point Strategy]]. Some focused on creating underground communication networks, while others established safe houses, hiding places, and communities of coherence for those hunted by the authorities. Others organized protests and public demonstrations to raise awareness, support the cause, and show the authorities that their iron grip was weakening. The People knew that the [[Old Authorities]] could not possibly arrest them all, and even within the prisons, Teams began to regroup and form. 

In the midst of this activity, Xion worked with wise community members and tirelessly refined and expanded the New Vision and Plan. He spent hours each day in deep prayer, seeking guidance from the Spirit, and wise council from [[The Elders]]. He also dedicated time to writing and contemplating, capturing the essence of the Vision and Plan, so that it could be translated by The Movement into accessible and compelling language in each of the vital languages of Earth.

Whenever the New Vision and Plan, it was automatically distributed across a decentralized network of servers via a push and pull system, ensuring each group had local access to the latest version if communications were severed. 

As weeks and months passed, the network of small groups grew and expanded, drawing more people to [[The Cause]]. The whispers of the New Vision and Plan became louder and more widespread until it seemed that everyone in the community was talking about nothing else. The corrupt leaders and the Forces Of Darkness sensed the shift and were furious, as they saw their ability to divide, control, and destroy slipping away. The gnashed their teeth and sharpened their weapons. But the people were determined to press on, confront and overcome the existential threats at hand, and co-create the New World they now knew was possible.
