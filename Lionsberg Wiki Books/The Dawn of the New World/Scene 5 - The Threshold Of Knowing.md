# Scene 5 - The Threshold Of Knowing

The gate in [[The Boundary]] where the fierce winged lions kept the children in and the Existential Threats out became known among the people as [[The Threshold Of Knowing]]. 

Marked by a large, imposing gate made of heavy wood and reinforced with iron bars, this gateway led to a mystery few people in the community ever dared to discuss. The people of Earth rarely ventured near it, even fewer ever approached it, and almost no one ever passed through it.

Over the years, many had attempted to cross the Threshold of Knowing, but few returned. Those who did spoke of a dangerous, hostile world beyond [[The Boundary]], full of fierce creatures and terrible dangers.

Despite the risks, there were times when someone had to cross [[The Threshold Of Knowing]]. In these instances, Earth's people chose one of their bravest and strongest members to undertake the perilous [[Quest]]. These courageous souls received extensive training and equipment from [[The Fellowship of the Unknown]], a secret society ensuring the necessary skills and knowledge for crossing [[The Boundary]] remained alive within the community. This K was a carefully guarded secret, known only to The Fellowship and to the occasional [[Heroes]] they armed with it, who became part of the Fellowship if they returned from [[Beyond]]. 

Those who crossed the Threshold of Knowing faced countless challenges and dangers. They encountered malevolent creatures of many strange kinds, navigated treacherous terrain, and overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Surviving these trials required not only their full skill and [[Courage]] but also [[Divine Assistance]] from the [[Spirit]] of the [[Creator]].

The few valiant souls who returned were hailed as [[Heroes]]. Celebrations erupted in the streets, and holidays and festivals were declared in their honor. Each time valuable Gifts, Boons and [[Information]] were brought back from beyond The Boundary, it invigorated and revitalized the community.
