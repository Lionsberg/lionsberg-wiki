# Scene 21 - An Intruder in the Secret Place

Xion was jolted awake by the touch of a hand on his shoulder. He leapt to his feet, ready to fight, and grabbed the arm of the intruder. As he did so, he heard a soft familiar voice whisper "Xion, stop, it's me." His heart was beating quickly, but as he recognized the familiar voice of his childhood friend Zaya, his iron grip softened and he pulled her close. The hug of a loving friend was exactly what he needed in that moment.

Xion's heart raced as he questioned Zaya's presence in the room. She looked back at him with concern and fear in her eyes. "Zaya, what are you doing here?" he asked. Zaya explained that the Spirit had urged to run to the window, where she caught sight of Xion fleeing from the guards. She knew that he would probably hide in the Secret Place in The Boundary where they had played together as children. "I brought you some food and blankets", she said. "What happened? Why were the guards chasing you?"

Xion hesitated before revealing his vision to Zaya, not wanting to put her in harm's way. However, he knew that he could not remain hidden forever and needed someone to confide in.

Zaya listened intently as Xion recounted his experience and the Spirit's guidance. Overwhelmed with emotion, Zaya pledged to stand by Xion and help him carry out the Plan. Xion, feeling a surge of hope and courage, knew that he had found a trusted ally, friend, and partner for this perilous journey.
