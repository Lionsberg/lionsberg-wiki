# Scene 2 - Humanity Awakens

In a distant corner of the universe, on the outskirts of a mesmerizing spiral galaxy, a unique star nurtured an exceptional child. This child, a planet with perfect conditions for life, held the potential for life to flourish.

To the intergalactic audience, it was like a sacred jewel, a unique greenhouse, a canvas for cosmoartistic co-creativity. 

One day, in a lush, green valley of paradise, a [[Man]] and a [[Woman]] awoke, rubbing their eyes as they adjusted to the blinding sunlight after what felt like an eternity of sleep. They could almost remember the Day before, but it felt like lifetimes ago. 

Finding themselves thrown into a strange, beautiful, and foreign land, they began to explore their new territory to try to find out where they were, and remember Who they were. The man and woman explored the valley, they were filled with awe and wonder at all the beautiful sights around them. They marveled at the colorful flowers and the towering trees, and they listened to the birds singing in the branches. Animals roamed through the valley, drinking from the majestic river of life.Â 

Yet they remained cautious, aware of the dangers lurking within the valley. Distant roars of monsters and dragons and the howls of werewolves reminded them to stay vigilant, pay [[Attention]], and be prepared for anything the Unknown could present.

Undeterred by the dangers, the man and woman resolved to make the most of their new home. They gathered fruit, nuts, and berries, and hunted animals when necessary. They built a shelter from sticks, stones, and leaves and collected firewood to stay warm at night.

As they settled into their new life and grew secure in their basic needs, their [[SpatioTemporal Domain]] of Concern began to expand, and they began to consider their [[Future]]. Knowing they needed to [[Co-Operate]] to survive, they imagined and formed a [[Society]] centered around a loving [[Family]]. They divided tasks and responsibilities, working tirelessly to improve their environment. Facing the [[Challenges]] and [[Opportunities]] of their [[New Territory]], the man and the woman remained hopeful and optimistic. They knew they possessed the strength and determination to overcome [[Obstacles]] and were committed to forging a bright and prosperous future for themselves and the society [[Emergence|Emerging]] through them.
