# Scene 22 - A Shared Plan Takes Shape

Throughout the night, Xion and Zaya discussed the details of the plan and how they would collaborate with the Spirit and the community of Earth to execute it.

As Xion shared more about the Spirit's guidance and the Vision and Plan, Zaya listened with rapt attention, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and excitement. She understood the dangers and revolutionary nature of the plan, but she also sensed that it was the only way to save their community from the talons of the encroaching Darkness.

They agreed to start by reaching out to small groups of people who they believed would be receptive to their message. From there, they would carefully build a growing network of support among those who were faithful and open-minded. They would have to ensure that the movement spread quickly enough to unite the community before it was attacked. 

As they talked through the night, the menacing sounds of monsters and beasts outside the walls grew louder. Frightened but resolute, they knew that they needed to act quickly if they had any hope of success. They vowed to support each other and trust in the Spirit's guidance as they embarked on this dangerous mission.

As dawn broke, Xion and Zaya parted ways, each with their own tasks to carry out in the coming days. Xion remained in his secret room, determined to begin his mission when the Spirit deemed it the right time and instructed him.
