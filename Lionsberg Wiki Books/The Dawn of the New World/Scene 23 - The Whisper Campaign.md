# Scene 23 - The Whisper Campaign

That day, Xion diligently conducted the final checks on the broadcast infrastructure. When the Spirit signaled it was time, he initiated the broadcast system and began to Speak. 

As the Spirit had told him, a select few received and understood the message's truth, embracing it with faith and hope. The message resonated deep within their hearts and souls, and they immediately set out to spread it to The First 1,000 of the population who also acknowledged its timeliness and Wisdom. Knowing it was their last best hope, they all started to pray and discern together, and their multitude of perspectives and collective discernment illuminated additional elements of the New Vision and Plan. 

The broadcasting system of the Secret Place continued to transmit the message to an ever-growing number of people as the tipping point strategy unfolded. Whispers of the New Vision and Plan began to circulate. As the whispers gained momentum, the religious and political elite became alarmed. They initiated a coordinated effort to identify and eliminate the source of the message, intending to destroy Xion once and for all. They conducted raids, arrested people, and attempted to uncover and shut down the broadcast system.

Xion and the growing Force For Good remained undeterred. They persisted in spreading the message through secret codes and encrypted communications to avoid detection. Each of them considered facing the risks of persecution and punishment a far better alternative than being devoured by the Forces Of Darkness, and they voluntarily faced into the risks with courage and persistence. 

As days passed, the whispers of the New Vision and Plan continued to multiply. The message spread exponentially, and soon thousands had heard, seen, and understood the New Vision and Plan. The Force For Good was awakening and arising.

Xion and the early Force For Good supporters were amazed and grateful for the outpouring of support. From the most unexpected places, resources and support poured in at just the right time. Encouraged by the increasing number of people willing to take a stand against corruption and evil, they persisted in spreading the message to others despite the risks and opposition, knowing that it was the only way to save their community from destruction.

As the message spread, the Old religious and political leaders intensified their efforts to thwart the spread of the Vision and Plan.  They continued searching for the broadcast source day and night, arresting and torturing anyone they suspected of involvement. But their efforts were futile, as the message spread like wildfire. The people could see the wisdom of the Vision and Plan, and they knew it was Wise, Right, and Good. 

Meanwhile, the Forces Of Darkness grew stronger daily, and they began advancing their siege towers and battering rams towards to the walls of Earth.
