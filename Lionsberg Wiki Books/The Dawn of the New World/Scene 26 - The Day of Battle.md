# Scene 26 - The Day of Battle

The Day of Battle arrived, and the Force For Good assembled before Dawn. United in their purpose, they prayed for strength and courage before crossing the Threshold into the Unknown. Riding a majestic white-winged horse and wielding the Sword of Truth, Xion led a diverse and determined multitude of groups, each ready to face the Forces of Darkness head-on.

The Forces of Darkness roared, and the battle began.

As the battle commenced, the Forces of Darkness unleashed their might, a sight both horrifying and awe-inspiring. However, the Force For Good, backed by the Forces of Heaven, met their adversaries with unwavering resolve. Though outnumbered physically, they were backed by an army of Angels and held their ground, drawing strength from their unity, their shared Vision and Plan, and from the Spirit and Power of God. As the battle continued, more groups joined the fight, bolstering their ranks and pushing back the Forces of Darkness.

Over several brutal days and nights, the battle raged on, with moments of despair when the Forces of Darkness seemed to prevail. Yet, the people of the Community fought with newfound determination, shocking the corrupt leaders who had stayed behind the safety of the Boundary. As the tide turned, Xion saw an opportunity to strike at the heart of the enemy forces. Leading a charge that pierced the Darkness, Xion and the One Body they had Become engaged the leader of the Forces Of Darkness in a fierce duel. In the end, the laser-sharp Light of the Sword of Truth glowed with the Light of Heaven and cut the Anti-One in two, and the Forces of Darkness were vanquished. As their leader fell, the Fascist Spell binding them together was broken, and their dissolving remnants scattered like dust in the wind. A sulfuric stench filled the air as the monstrous beings dissolved. 

With the battle won, the people rejoiced and vowed to rebuild their society and co-create the New World revealed by the Spirit's Vision and Plan.
