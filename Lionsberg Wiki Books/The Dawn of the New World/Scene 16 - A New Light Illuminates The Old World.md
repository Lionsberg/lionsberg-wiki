# Scene 16 - A New Light Illuminates The Old World

As Xion finished writing the Logos of the New Vision and Plan, the sun began to rise, heralding the New Dawn of a New Day. Though darkness lingered, Xion sensed that the New was already present and at hand. Having transcended the illusion of Space and Time, he understood that the New World was already here, yearning to be seen and experienced by Earth's citizens. They just had to awaken, arise, and pass [[Through The Eye Of The Needle]]. 

Xion descended from the ramparts of The Boundary and ventured through the community.

Having been enraptured in a Divine Vision of the emerging New World, Xion was disheartened, repulsed, and stunned by the Old World's state of decay. The cacophony of sadness, sights, and smells clashed discordantly with the perfect Beauty and Coherence of Heaven. Earth's people remained divided, bewildered, and consumed by fear and suffering.

As Xion traversed the community, he was filled with sorrow. The streets were littered with trash, needles, and debris, the homeless and the hopeless slumped over in drugged stupor, and Earth's people hid in their homes, frightened and confused. Even worse was the terror in the eyes of those lying in the streets and sidewalks, who lacked even a shelter to hide in from the terrible sensations that assaulted them. 

As Xion continued, he saw Earth's people suffering, their pain palpable. His heart broke for them. With each step and new sight, his resolve intensified. He felt himself tingling and transforming as his DNA activated the New coding prepared in advance for this moment in Time.
