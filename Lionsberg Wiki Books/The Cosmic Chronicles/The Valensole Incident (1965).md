### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the early morning of July 1, 1965, Maurice Masse was tending to his lavender field when he noticed a strange, egg-shaped object descending silently. The craft, roughly 6–7 feet tall and 10 feet wide, landed on four retractable legs about 60 feet from him. Intrigued and cautious, Masse approached the object.

As he drew nearer, he noticed two small beings standing beside the craft. The entities were approximately 4 feet tall, with large heads, almond-shaped eyes, and wearing tight-fitting suits. Masse described them as humanoid but with distinctly non-human features. The beings seemed to be examining the lavender plants before one of them noticed Masse and pointed a device at him.

Masse reported feeling paralyzed and unable to move. The beings then entered the craft, which emitted a soft humming sound, retracted its legs, and ascended vertically at high speed.

#### **Physical Evidence**

The site of the encounter revealed clear physical traces:

1. **Landing Marks:**
    
    - Four circular impressions were found in the soil, corresponding to the craft’s landing legs. These marks were deeply embedded, suggesting a heavy object.
2. **Soil Changes:**
    
    - Investigators found that the soil in the landing area had been compacted and exhibited unusual chemical changes, including altered calcium content and organic material.
3. **Plant Damage:**
    
    - The lavender plants near the landing site showed signs of desiccation and inhibited growth. These effects persisted for years, indicating exposure to an unknown force.

#### **Scientific Analysis**

- Soil samples were collected and analyzed in laboratories, revealing compacted and dehydrated soil with altered mineral properties.
- The inhibited growth of nearby plants was consistent with exposure to intense heat or radiation.

#### **Witness Credibility**

Maurice Masse was known as a quiet, reliable farmer with no prior interest in UFOs or the paranormal. His detailed, consistent testimony and visible emotional distress after the incident were widely regarded as genuine.
