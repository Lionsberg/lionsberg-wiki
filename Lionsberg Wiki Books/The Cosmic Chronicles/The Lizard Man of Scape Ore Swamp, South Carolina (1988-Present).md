### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The First Encounter**

On June 29, 1988, 17-year-old Christopher Davis experienced a terrifying encounter near Scape Ore Swamp. After stopping to change a flat tire at approximately 2 a.m., Davis reported being approached by a towering humanoid figure with green, scaly skin, glowing red eyes, and three-fingered hands. The creature allegedly tried to attack his car as he fled, leaving scratches and damage to the vehicle.

#### **Subsequent Sightings**

Following Davis’s account, local residents began reporting sightings of a similar creature. Many described a reptilian humanoid, while others reported strange scratches and bite marks on their vehicles. The creature’s physical description—a tall, bipedal reptile with powerful limbs—resonates with accounts of reptilian beings reported elsewhere, such as the "Reptoid" encounters in California and the Loveland Frogmen sightings in Ohio.

#### **Global Parallels**

The Lizard Man shares characteristics with similar reports worldwide:

- **Australia:** In the Outback, Aboriginal legends describe the "Bunyip," sometimes depicted as a large, scaly humanoid.
- **United Kingdom:** The "Lizard Man of Cornwall" was reportedly sighted in the 1970s, described as a green, reptilian figure with glowing eyes.
