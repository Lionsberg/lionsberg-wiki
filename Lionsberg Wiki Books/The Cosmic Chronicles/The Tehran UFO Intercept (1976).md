# The Tehran UFO Intercept (1976)

**Summary:**  
The Tehran UFO Intercept is one of the most well-documented military encounters with a UFO, involving advanced technology that outmaneuvered Iranian fighter jets and disrupted their weapon and communication systems. On the night of September 19, 1976, Iranian Air Force pilots attempted to intercept a luminous object over the capital city of Tehran. The UFO displayed extraordinary speed, agility, and electromagnetic interference capabilities. This event, corroborated by radar operators, pilots, and civilian witnesses, remains a key case in UFO research due to its multiple sources of verification and detailed military records.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Tehran UFO Intercept highlights the limitations of modern military technology against unidentified aerial phenomena. With corroborating evidence from radar, visual sightings, and system malfunctions, the event underscores the recurring theme of UFOs demonstrating advanced capabilities that far exceed human technology.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Initial Sighting and Response**

On September 19, 1976, the Iranian Air Force received multiple calls from civilians reporting a luminous object in the sky over Tehran. Radar operators confirmed the presence of an object displaying unusual flight characteristics. Scrambling an F-4 Phantom jet, the Air Force initiated an intercept mission.

As the jet approached the object, its instrumentation and communications systems malfunctioned, forcing the pilot to retreat. A second F-4 was dispatched and successfully closed the distance to the object. The pilot described the UFO as a brightly glowing craft with flashing multicolored lights. The object emitted smaller, luminous objects, one of which rapidly approached the jet.

#### **Engagement with the UFO**

The pilot attempted to lock missiles onto the approaching object but found his weapon systems had become inoperative. He then executed evasive maneuvers as the smaller object circled his aircraft before returning to the larger craft. Another luminous object descended toward the ground, prompting the Iranian military to dispatch a helicopter to investigate. The glowing object on the ground reportedly vanished before they arrived.
