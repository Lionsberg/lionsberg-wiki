# Kenneth Arnold's Sighting of Flying Crescents (1947)

**Summary:**  
Kenneth Arnold’s sighting on June 24, 1947, near Mount Rainier, Washington, is widely regarded as the incident that introduced the term “flying saucer” into popular culture and launched the modern UFO phenomenon. Arnold, a respected private pilot, reported seeing nine crescent-shaped objects flying at incredible speeds in formation. His sighting set off a media frenzy and led to a wave of similar reports, marking the beginning of America’s fascination with unidentified flying objects.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Sighting**

On June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, a businessman and experienced pilot, was flying his CallAir A-2 aircraft near Mount Rainier while searching for a downed U.S. Marine transport plane. At approximately 3:00 PM, Arnold’s attention was drawn to a series of bright flashes in the distance. Thinking it might be sunlight glinting off another aircraft, he looked closer and observed nine unusual objects flying in a chain-like formation.

The objects were crescent-shaped, with no discernible tail or wings, and emitted a bright metallic glint. Arnold estimated their size to be approximately 50 feet wide and noted their extraordinary speed, later calculated to be around 1,700 miles per hour—well beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft at the time. The objects maneuvered with remarkable agility, weaving in and out of mountain peaks and appearing to skim along the terrain “like a saucer skipping over water,” a description that gave rise to the term “flying saucer.”

#### **Immediate Reaction**

Arnold landed in Yakima, Washington, and recounted his experience to fellow pilots and airport personnel. Word of the sighting spread quickly, and Arnold was soon inundated with requests from the media. Although he described the objects as crescent-shaped rather than saucer-like, the term “flying saucer” became a media sensation, embedding itself in the public imagination.

#### **Credibility and Investigation**

Arnold’s background as a skilled and reliable pilot lent significant weight to his testimony. He meticulously calculated the speed and trajectory of the objects using landmarks and his own flight path, ruling out conventional explanations such as weather balloons or experimental aircraft. Military officials and civilian investigators, including those from Project Sign (a precursor to Project Blue Book), took his account seriously but could not provide a definitive explanation.
