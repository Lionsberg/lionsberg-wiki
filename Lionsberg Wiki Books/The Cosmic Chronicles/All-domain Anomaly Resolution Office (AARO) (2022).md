# All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) (2022)

### **Introduction**

The **All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)** was established in **July 2022** to investigate and resolve anomalies across multiple domains—air, sea, space, and transmedium—within the context of U.S. national security. The office represents an evolution of previous efforts like [[Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)]], [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)]], and [[The Pentagon's UAP Task Force (UAPTF) (2020)]], broadening the scope and expanding the organizational framework for addressing unidentified phenomena.

AARO’s creation reflects growing recognition of the need for a systematic approach to UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) and other unidentified anomalies that may pose safety, security, and technological challenges.

### **Origins and Mandate**

1. **Origins:**
    
    - AARO was established following the recommendations of the **June 2021 UAPTF Report**, which highlighted the limitations of existing efforts to study UAPs and related phenomena.
    - The office was created under the oversight of the **Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (USD(I&S))** to ensure a coordinated, all-domain approach.
2. **Mandate:**
    
    - Investigate and resolve unidentified phenomena observed across air, maritime, terrestrial, and space domains, as well as transmedium vehicles capable of transitioning between these domains.
    - Assess potential national security threats and provide actionable intelligence to defense and intelligence stakeholders.
    - Collaborate with scientific, technical, and academic communities to enhance understanding and analysis.

### **Key Objectives**

1. **Data Collection and Standardization:**
    
    - Develop protocols for the consistent and comprehensive collection of data on UAPs and anomalies.
    - Standardize reporting processes across all branches of the military, intelligence agencies, and relevant civilian organizations.
2. **Threat Assessment:**
    
    - Analyze anomalies to determine their origin, capabilities, intent, and potential threat to U.S. national security.
    - Evaluate whether anomalies are attributable to foreign adversaries, natural phenomena, or unknown technological sources.
3. **Cross-Domain Analysis:**
    
    - Expand beyond the focus on aerial phenomena to investigate anomalies in maritime, space, and transmedium environments.
    - Integrate sensor data, eyewitness accounts, and advanced analytics to create a multidimensional understanding of anomalous events.
4. **Transparency and Oversight:**
    
    - Provide regular briefings to Congress and maintain open channels of communication with the public to ensure transparency.
    - Encourage collaborative research and reduce stigma surrounding UAP reporting.

### **Structure and Leadership**

1. **Organizational Framework:**
    
    - Operates under the **Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security**.
    - Coordinates with the Department of Defense (DoD), intelligence community, civilian researchers, and international partners.
2. **Leadership:**
    
    - Directed by experts in intelligence, defense, and scientific research, ensuring a multidisciplinary approach.
    - As of its founding, **Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick**, a physicist with a background in advanced technologies, serves as its first director.

### **Key Areas of Investigation**

1. **Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP):**
    
    - Continue investigating aerial objects displaying advanced propulsion, maneuverability, and flight characteristics beyond known human technology.
2. **Maritime and Submarine Anomalies:**
    
    - Examine reports of unidentified underwater objects (USOs) capable of moving at extraordinary speeds or transitioning between air and water.
3. **Space-based Phenomena:**
    
    - Monitor anomalies observed in orbital and extraterrestrial environments, including unidentified objects tracked by satellites.
4. **Transmedium Vehicles:**
    
    - Analyze phenomena involving objects capable of seamless transitions between air, water, and space, a key characteristic of many UAPs.

### **Key Challenges**

1. **Data and Resource Gaps:**
    
    - Address the lack of high-quality, corroborative data for many UAP sightings.
    - Overcome the fragmentation of data collection across multiple agencies and organizations.
2. **Stigma and Skepticism:**
    
    - Combat the historical stigma surrounding UAP reporting, which has deterred many credible witnesses from coming forward.
    - Bridge the gap between scientific curiosity and national security concerns.
3. **Technological Complexity:**
    
    - Investigate anomalies that may represent advanced technologies, whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial in origin.
    - Analyze capabilities such as hypersonic speeds, sudden accelerations, and transmedium mobility.
4. **International Coordination:**
    
    - Collaborate with international partners to share data and insights on UAPs, recognizing their global nature.
5. **Intentional Disinformation:**
    
    - Many aspects of the [[Fascist Security State]] do not want truth and transparency in regards to the issues relating to UAP and extraterrestrials. Concerns immediately emerged that this was the next carefully scripted step in [[Controlled Disclosure]].
