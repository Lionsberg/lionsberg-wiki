### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Ed Walters and the Photographs**

In November 1987, Ed Walters claimed to have observed and photographed a disk-shaped craft hovering near his home. The object reportedly emitted beams of light that illuminated the ground, and Walters described experiencing a "paralyzing" effect during one encounter.

Walters produced several photographs of the UFO, which displayed a distinctive design:

- Disk-shaped, with a bright glowing underside.
- Emanating beams of light that appeared focused and directional.

The photographs quickly gained attention and were published in the local newspaper, _The Gulf Breeze Sentinel_.

#### **The Wave of Sightings**

Following the publication of Walters' photographs, dozens of residents in Gulf Breeze and surrounding areas began reporting similar sightings. Key incidents included:

- **Multiple Witness Accounts:**  
    Independent reports of glowing craft maneuvering silently in the night sky.
    
- **Military Witnesses:**  
    Several individuals from nearby Eglin Air Force Base claimed to have observed unidentified craft.
    
- **Physical Effects:**  
    Witnesses described power outages and electromagnetic interference coinciding with sightings.
    

#### **Subsequent Developments**

The Gulf Breeze wave continued through 1988 and 1989, with ongoing reports and new photographs emerging. Walters claimed further encounters, including interactions with humanoid beings associated with the craft. However, controversy arose when skeptics argued that a model UFO found in Walters' former home cast doubt on the authenticity of his photographs.
