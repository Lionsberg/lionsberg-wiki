# The Kaikoura Lights, New Zealand (1978)

**Summary:**  
The Kaikoura Lights refer to a series of UFO sightings over the Kaikoura region of New Zealand in December 1978. The phenomenon involved multiple bright, fast-moving objects tracked visually, on radar, and filmed by a television news crew aboard a commercial aircraft. The Kaikoura Lights gained international attention as one of the most well-documented UFO incidents of the 20th century, featuring corroborating evidence from credible witnesses, radar operators, and video footage.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Kaikoura Lights stand out due to the convergence of visual, radar, and video evidence, alongside testimony from experienced pilots and a news crew. The case highlights the challenges of dismissing UFO encounters when multiple forms of evidence align.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Initial Sightings**

On the night of December 21, 1978, radar operators at Wellington Air Traffic Control detected unexplained objects near the Kaikoura coast. Simultaneously, pilots aboard a Safe Air cargo flight reported seeing bright lights that appeared to follow their aircraft. The objects moved at extraordinary speeds, performed rapid maneuvers, and disappeared before reappearing elsewhere.

#### **Televised Encounter**

The most significant sighting occurred on December 30, 1978, when a news crew from Channel 0 (Australia) boarded a Safe Air cargo flight specifically to investigate the phenomenon. Pilots Captain Vern Powell and First Officer Ian Pirie flew the aircraft, accompanied by journalist Quentin Fogarty, cameraman David Crockett, and sound recordist Dennis Grant.

During the flight, multiple bright lights appeared, seemingly following the aircraft. The objects performed erratic movements, disappearing and reappearing at various distances. The news crew captured the phenomenon on film, providing one of the earliest televised recordings of a UFO encounter.

#### **Radar and Visual Correlation**

Wellington radar operators tracked the objects concurrently with the crew’s visual observations. The radar returns indicated solid, unidentified objects moving at high speeds and in ways inconsistent with conventional aircraft. The pilots confirmed the radar readings, adding credibility to the event.

#### **Post-Event Analysis**

The footage, radar data, and eyewitness accounts were analyzed by various experts and organizations, including New Zealand’s Air Force and independent researchers. Official explanations, such as Venus, squid boats, or anomalous radar returns, failed to fully account for the combined evidence.

### **Investigations**

#### **New Zealand Air Force:**

The Royal New Zealand Air Force investigated the incident but did not provide a conclusive explanation. Their report acknowledged the credibility of the witnesses and the anomalous nature of the radar data.

#### **Civilian Analysis:**

UFO researchers analyzed the footage and radar data, concluding that the objects exhibited characteristics inconsistent with known human technology.

#### **Skeptical Explanations:**

Some skeptics attributed the lights to reflections from squid boat lamps, the planet Venus, or atmospheric phenomena. However, these explanations were dismissed by witnesses and investigators as insufficient.
