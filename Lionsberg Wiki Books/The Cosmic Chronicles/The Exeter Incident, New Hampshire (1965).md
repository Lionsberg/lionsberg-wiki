### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Norman Muscarello’s Encounter**

At approximately 2:00 AM on September 3, 1965, 18-year-old Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking home to Exeter, New Hampshire, along a quiet rural road. As he neared a field, a massive, silent object suddenly appeared, hovering low above the trees. The object was described as disc-shaped, approximately 80–90 feet wide, with pulsating red lights that illuminated the surrounding area.

Terrified, Muscarello dove into a ditch to avoid detection. After the object moved closer, he fled to a nearby house but found no one home. Eventually, a passing car stopped, and the driver took him to the Exeter Police Department.

#### **Police Corroboration**

At the station, Officer Eugene Bertrand listened to Muscarello’s account. Earlier that evening, Bertrand had encountered a distressed motorist who claimed she had seen a glowing, red object following her car. Bertrand decided to investigate and brought Muscarello back to the scene. They were soon joined by another officer, David Hunt.

The officers and Muscarello witnessed the same pulsating, glowing object as it silently hovered over the field, occasionally darting side to side in rapid, precise movements. At one point, the object descended closer to the treetops, flooding the field with light. After several minutes, it ascended quickly and vanished.
