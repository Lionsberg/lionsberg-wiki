# Wisdom From a Zuni Elder

My name is Clifford Mahooty. I am a Zuni Pueblo Elder. 

I come from the Zuni Indian tribe from New Mexico, and I have an extensive background in my teachings about the star people, the priesthood of the sky, and all the different activities related by them or for them with the humans and the planet. 

I was born into a medicine society called the Galaxy Society... I was not only born into it, but I believe that my mission was to actually look at, into some of the activities related to the star people with the humans on the planet, and of course, with [[Mother Earth]] overall. 

My scientific background is that I am an engineer. I started science at a very young age, and throughout my career I have worked in some of the most sophisticated government systems, not only in the government, but also in the private sector. 

The reason that I am very interested in the extraterrestrial phenomena is that our tribe has extensive knowledge of the connection with the [[Star People]]. 

All our protocols of taking care of each other on the planet, of taking care of the planet, were transferred from the Star People into the early human stages of the Zuni people, and other Pueblos like the Hopi, the Pueblo people around Albuquerque and Santa Fe, New Mexico. 

Years later I started to talk with other indian tribes. They also have the same knowledge about star people, of their connection with them. The only difference between say, like the Hopi, the Pueblo, and all is our language. 

And also later on I also looked at the other aboriginal tribes of the planet, whether they be in Africa, like the Dogons, or whether they be in Australia like the Aborigines, and all throughout the planet. And they have the same concepts, the same meanings of what we are here on the planet for. 

The American Indian people did not invent any of this type of rituals or procedures, like on the religious side. For example, spirituality and religion are confused a lot of times. Our is based on spirituality. And religion, like the other established religions, are invented by a man, and not transferred or given to us by ...the extraterrestrial people. So the star knowledge we have is nothing that was made up. It has always been with us, all the protocols, whether it be in relationships with humans, whether it be in connection with Mother Nature, were passed on to us. 

They were downloaded thousands of years ago. So we have always had that basic knowledge... or that information that has been incorporated into our DNA, because humans are actually hybrids of the the Space People based on what I have studied. 

Extraterrestrials are those beings that came through our solar perhaps millions of years ago, because there is no time, as the indians would say. You ask them 'when did they come', and the word that they use interpreted into English is since time immemorial, which means a long time ago, but we do not know exactly when. Nobody does. 

And all our prayers, all our rituals, all our ceremonies are based upon that concept. It's based upon a long, long time ago. 

Now there's another concept that is also part of the extraterrestrial information **that the earth has flipped on its axis at least 13 times**, which would probably go into the billins of years. 

Now the American Indian, at least my tribe, the Zuni indian tribe, has said that we have gone through three great catastrophes. And we're now at the verge of the fourth catastrophe, which in this case will be wiped out by fire. 

The last one was by water, as we all know. There's a lot of references to it. If you look at the Bible, they also talk about The Great Flood. There's other aboriginal tribes that also talked about the flood time. And also right after the flood was the Ice Ago. 

And so there is a lot of information out there. The only problem in the Zuni case is that we don't have a written language, but we do have an oral history, which is repeated on a monthly basis, if not, maybe on a daily basis when our grandfather were still young people. 

But we do know, or at least my teaching is, that if you take these concepts in terms of time and incidences and the history, we know that it parallels with the same information as in the scientists of other groups, and also the timetables of many books that have been written about, for example the holy bible. 

If you go back into the old, the pharaohs of Egypt, or if you come down here to places in Mesoamerica, Peru, and other places, you have these skulls that are elongated, and those were hybrids. And even to this day, there are hybrids walking into the lives, or at least into the planet, that have really good ways to take care of the people, but eventually they're gotten rid of, because they're half alien and they're half humans. 

Now present day hybrids, or the, what we call the Rainbow Children, they have advanced knowledge. They can come, they're here right now. They've always been here. The previous groups were called way back in the 50s, they called them Blue Children, and eventually they turned to Indigos. And then now, they went into the Crystal Children. 

Those in my opinion, based upon many, many studies, not only historical, but scientific, and theological studies, is that these are the ones that are, even though they're born of human mothers, they were put on this earth to lead us out, if you want to call it that, or be leaders, but the've always categorized them as not part of the human society. 

They have that special connection with the Star People system, and I'm still trying to write these things up before I go on to the next world, because if I wrote them back in the, when I met them, nobody would believe me, but I did meet those type of people. And when I asked for their guidance on certain things, it doesn't take very long for somebody to show up. 

The source of all (our prophetic information) is what we call the Star People. 

We are now at the 500th year of the introduction of what we call the white man. And we are also at the end of that span, they can only last so much. 

And the other group that is very fierce right now is what we call the Dark Force People. The Dark Force people are those rich people; the people that have, in Zuni they call them the witchcraft people, that practice malevolent systems upon their own people, and even among themselves. 

So we're at that stage, and these are all the things that are put into the concepts of why we're gonna go into that end of the world situation. 

Its not gonna be an invasion from other sources, from other solar systems, planets, or universe. Its going to be done by ourselves, within our own communities. 

No Star People or no spaceship is going to land and take us away from what we had created. They are only observing us, because they gave us what we call our free will. We're the ones that have to decide. They're not going to come over here and interfere because those concepts were already put in place in the beginning. We can ask for guidance, but we have to do it; from the individual, as a group, and so on. 

The poor people in this country are without any shelter. They can't take care of themselves, but we are feeding our enemies. This is the prophesy that the grandfathers told me, and we will go into a famine. So these are the things I am watching. 

I was hoping that they were wrong, but they were not. So this is the reason I am won't quit talking yet, because as long as you're the lone voice in the wilderness, hopefully somebody will come and help you. 

But in order for the next world to come in a peaceful way as its supposed to be, there has to be a clearing... we have to go through a time of cleansing. The people have been asleep for a long time, especially with this country. And I can honestly tell you, this started about the time when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. So that's way back in 1963, when they started this whole effort. And I have been very observant, and I have studied these things from many different angles, the scientific, the historical, and the references that are made in many religious scriptures.
