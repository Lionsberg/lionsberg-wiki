### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the morning of November 9, 1979, Robert Taylor, a forestry worker employed by the Livingston Development Corporation, was inspecting a forested area in Dechmont Woods, just outside Livingston. While walking his dog through the woods, Taylor encountered a large, dome-shaped object approximately 20 feet in diameter hovering just above the ground.

The craft appeared metallic with a rough texture and was surrounded by a ring of smaller spheres. As Taylor approached, two spiked spheres detached from the craft and rolled toward him. The spheres emitted a faint hissing sound, and before Taylor could react, they attached themselves to his trousers and began pulling him toward the craft.

Taylor reported feeling an intense pressure in his head and losing consciousness. When he awoke, the craft and the spheres were gone, but he found himself disoriented and unable to stand. His trousers were torn, and he eventually crawled back to his truck and returned home, where he recounted the incident to his wife.

#### **Police Involvement**

The incident was reported to the Lothian and Borders Police, who treated it as an assault case—the only officially documented UFO case investigated by police in Scotland. Officers inspected the site, photographed the ground markings, and examined Taylor’s torn trousers.

#### **Scientific Analysis**

- Soil samples were taken from the site, revealing no evidence of contamination or chemical residues.
- The ground impressions were determined to be consistent with a heavy, mechanical object but could not be definitively linked to known equipment.
