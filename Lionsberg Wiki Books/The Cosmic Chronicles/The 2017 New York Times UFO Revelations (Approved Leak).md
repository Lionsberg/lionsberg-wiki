# The 2017 New York Times UFO Revelations (Approved Leak)

### **Introduction**

On December 16, 2017, _The New York Times_ published a groundbreaking article titled, “[Glowing Auras and ‘BlackMoney’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious UFO Program](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html),” which revealed the existence of a secretive Pentagon program investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Known as the **Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)**, the story quickly became a cultural and political milestone in the long-disputed realm of UFO phenomena. Spearheaded by seasoned journalists Helene Cooper, Ralph Blumenthal, and Leslie Kean, the article exposed decades of governmental secrecy and introduced compelling evidence of UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) encounters.

This moment marked a pivotal shift from ridicule to mainstream legitimacy in the UFO conversation. It was also described by some as a carefully managed “approved leak,” reflecting deeper intelligence goals.

### **The Core Revelations**

1. **Existence of AATIP:**
    
    - The article disclosed the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which operated from 2007 to 2012 under the leadership of James Lacatski and later Luis Elizondo.
    - Funded with $22 million, the program was spearheaded by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and operated with the assistance of aerospace billionaire Robert Bigelow.
2. **Declassified Footage:**
    
    - Three declassified videos, including the now-famous “_Tic Tac_,” “_Gimbal_,” and “_GoFast_,” were released alongside the article. These videos showed U.S. Navy pilots encountering highly anomalous objects exhibiting extraordinary flight characteristics, including:
        - Hypersonic speeds.
        - Lack of visible propulsion or wings.
        - Extreme agility far exceeding known human technology.
3. **Official Documentation:**
    
    - The article cited Pentagon officials and documents confirming that AATIP studied potential threats posed by these objects and attempted to assess their advanced technology.
4. **Statements from Officials:**
    
    - Luis Elizondo, who resigned from the Pentagon in protest of excessive secrecy, stated, “My personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone.”
    - Senator Harry Reid acknowledged his role in creating the program, calling it “one of the good things I did in my congressional service.”
