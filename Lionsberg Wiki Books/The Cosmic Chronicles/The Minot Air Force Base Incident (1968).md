# The Minot Air Force Base Incident (1968)

**Summary:**  
The Minot Air Force Base Incident of October 24, 1968, is a highly credible UFO encounter involving multiple military witnesses, radar confirmation, and interaction with nuclear missile systems. Air Force personnel stationed at the base in North Dakota reported seeing a glowing, dome-shaped craft near the missile silos. The UFO was observed visually and tracked on radar, performing maneuvers beyond the capabilities of any known human technology. The case underscores the recurring pattern of UFO activity around nuclear facilities and remains one of the most well-documented military UFO events.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Incident**

On the early morning of October 24, 1968, personnel at Minot Air Force Base detected an unidentified object on radar. Security guards at the base’s missile silos reported seeing a glowing, dome-shaped craft emitting a pulsating, multicolored light. The UFO was described as moving silently and performing sudden, sharp maneuvers.

An Air Force B-52 bomber on a training mission near the base also encountered the object. The crew observed the UFO visually and tracked it on their radar systems. The craft performed erratic movements, at one point approaching the B-52 so closely that the crew feared a collision. The encounter lasted several minutes before the object rapidly ascended and disappeared.

Back at the base, missile maintenance crews reported strange malfunctions in the missile systems, though no total shutdown occurred as in the Malmstrom case. Personnel were visibly shaken by the event, and the incident was quickly classified.
