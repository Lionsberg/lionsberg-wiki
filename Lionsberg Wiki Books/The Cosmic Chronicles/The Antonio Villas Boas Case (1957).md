On October 16, 1957, 23-year-old Brazilian farmer Antonio Villas Boas claimed he was abducted by humanoid beings while working late at night in his fields. He described being taken aboard a craft, subjected to medical procedures, and engaging in a strange, intimate encounter with a humanoid female being.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Abduction**

On the night of October 16, 1957, Villas Boas was working his fields near São Francisco de Sales, Brazil, under the light of a tractor lamp. He noticed a bright, red star-like object in the sky, which grew larger and descended until it landed nearby. Startled, Villas Boas attempted to flee but was intercepted by four humanoid beings who dragged him aboard their craft.

#### **The Examination**

Once inside, Villas Boas was stripped of his clothing and covered in a gel-like substance. He was placed on a table where the beings subjected him to medical examinations, including the extraction of blood from his chin. He described the beings as humanoid, about 5 feet tall, with small blue eyes and gray, tight-fitting uniforms.

#### **The Intimate Encounter**

The most sensational aspect of Villas Boas’s account was his interaction with a humanoid female being. She was described as having a human-like appearance, with white skin, large almond-shaped eyes, and long, platinum-blonde hair. Villas Boas claimed the female initiated a sexual encounter, and he believed the purpose was to create a hybrid being. Afterward, the female pointed to her stomach and then gestured upward, which Villas Boas interpreted as indicating that their offspring would be raised elsewhere.

#### **Release and Aftermath**

After the encounter, Villas Boas was allowed to dress and was escorted off the craft. The object ascended into the sky and disappeared. Following the event, Villas Boas experienced symptoms including nausea, headaches, and skin lesions resembling burns, which doctors attributed to possible radiation exposure.
