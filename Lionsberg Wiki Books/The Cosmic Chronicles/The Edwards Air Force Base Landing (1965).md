# The Edwards Air Force Base Landing (1965)

**Summary:**  
The Edwards Air Force Base Landing is a landmark UFO case involving a reported close encounter with an unidentified craft that landed on the highly secure military installation. On October 7, 1965, multiple military personnel observed a luminous, disc-shaped object performing extraordinary aerial maneuvers before landing on the base. Radar operators confirmed the craft’s presence, and ground personnel provided detailed descriptions of its structure and behavior. This incident, documented through military records and audio recordings, remains one of the most credible UFO cases in U.S. history.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Initial Sightings**

On the night of October 7, 1965, radar operators at Edwards Air Force Base detected an unidentified object moving erratically near the installation. Multiple ground personnel, including air traffic controllers and security officers, visually confirmed the object as a disc-shaped craft emitting a pulsating light.

The craft exhibited extraordinary flight characteristics, including hovering, sudden accelerations, and silent movement. Witnesses described its movements as deliberate and intelligent, suggesting it was under control.

#### **The Landing**

The UFO reportedly descended and landed in a remote section of the base. Security teams were dispatched to investigate but were instructed to maintain a safe distance. Observers described the craft as metallic, with a smooth, reflective surface and no visible seams or rivets. It emitted a faint humming sound and a soft glow, and no conventional markings or features like engines or exhaust were visible.

After several minutes, the object rose silently into the air, executed sharp maneuvers, and disappeared at an extraordinary speed. Subsequent checks of the area revealed no immediate physical traces, though some personnel reported subtle disruptions to electronic equipment.

#### **Witness Reactions**

Audio recordings from the base’s control tower captured the astonished reactions of personnel as they tracked the UFO. The professionalism and detailed accounts of the witnesses, many of whom were trained military personnel, add significant credibility to the case.
