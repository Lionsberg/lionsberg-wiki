# The MAJESTIC-12 (MJ-12) Program (1947 - Present)

### **Introduction**

The **MAJESTIC-12 (MJ-12)** program refers to a secretive and highly compartmentalized initiative reportedly established by the U.S. government in **1947** to manage extraterrestrial-related phenomena. Emerging in connection with the **Roswell Incident**, MJ-12 is said to oversee the recovery and reverse-engineering of alien technology, the management of contact with extraterrestrial biological entities (EBEs), and the orchestration of global disinformation campaigns to keep this knowledge hidden from public awareness.

Congressional hearings, leaked documents, and testimony from military insiders increasingly corroborate the existence of deep black-budget programs associated with UFO phenomena, lending credibility to longstanding assertions of a clandestine initiative like MJ-12.

### **Origins of MJ-12**

1. **The Roswell Incident (1947)**
    
    - In **July 1947**, a reported crash near Roswell, New Mexico, marked a pivotal moment in UFO history. Eyewitnesses, including military personnel, described recovering materials and bodies not of earthly origin.
    - In response, **President Harry S. Truman** allegedly authorized the formation of MJ-12 to manage the fallout and conceal the true nature of the incident.
2. **Presidential Directive**
    
    - A **Top Secret memorandum dated September 24, 1947**, purportedly signed by Truman, established MJ-12. This directive tasked the group with centralizing control over all extraterrestrial-related matters, from crash recovery to public relations.
3. **A Strategic Response**
    
    - The group's mandate reportedly included:
        - Coordinating scientific analysis of recovered alien materials.
        - Crafting disinformation strategies to mislead the public and rival nations.
        - Advising successive U.S. presidents on extraterrestrial phenomena.

### **Evidence Supporting MJ-12**

1. **The Eisenhower Briefing Document (1952)**
    
    - This memo allegedly prepared for President Eisenhower provides a detailed summary of MJ-12’s activities, including Roswell-related recoveries and the analysis of non-human entities.
    - Subsequent whistleblower accounts align with key details in the document, particularly regarding extraterrestrial retrievals.
2. **Testimony from High-Ranking Officials**
    
    - Numerous military officers and defense contractors, including **Admiral Wilson**, have provided firsthand accounts of programs that match the MJ-12 framework, describing efforts to reverse-engineer non-human craft and conceal the operations from elected officials.
3. **Corroborated Practices**
    
    - The recovery and analysis of exotic materials, as well as the compartmentalized handling of UFO encounters, are consistent with MJ-12’s alleged operations. Recent revelations from **AARO** and Congressional hearings further substantiate claims of secretive programs managing extraterrestrial materials.

### **MJ-12’s Role in the Broader Extraterrestrial Agenda**

1. **Crash Retrievals**
    
    - MJ-12’s primary mission included the recovery of extraterrestrial craft and entities, securing them for reverse-engineering and analysis.
    - Locations such as **Area 51** and **Wright-Patterson Air Force Base** are believed to have served as repositories for these materials.
2. **Technological Advancements**
    
    - Whistleblowers have described breakthroughs in materials science, propulsion systems, and energy technologies originating from extraterrestrial sources under MJ-12’s purview.
3. **Global Influence**
    
    - MJ-12’s secrecy extended to global operations, coordinating with allied nations and suppressing UFO-related evidence through media control and disinformation campaigns.

### **Modern Implications**

1. **Transnational Transcendence of Military and Black-Budget Programs**
    
    - MJ-12’s role has evolved, becoming part of a larger [[Fascist Security State]] / [[Illegal Secret Government]] co-operating the transnational [[Military Industrial Complex]], along with clandestine structures such as **AAWSAP**, **AATIP**, various defense contractors and joint ventures, etc., which continue to investigate UAP phenomena and reverse engineer alien technologies under extreme secrecy.
2. **Congressional Oversight**
    
    - Recent Congressional hearings have exposed the lack of transparency surrounding UAP-related programs, highlighting the need for greater accountability for initiatives stemming from MJ-12.
3. **Public Awakening**
    
    - The acknowledgment of UAPs by defense officials and increasing evidence of extraterrestrial involvement have reignited interest in MJ-12, suggesting that long-held secrets may soon be fully revealed.

### **Additional Alleged Associates**

Some researchers and whistleblowers have suggested that additional figures might have been involved with or consulted by MJ-12, including:

- **Edward Teller:** Physicist known as the "father of the hydrogen bomb," potentially linked to reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology.
- **Dr. J. Allen Hynek:** Astronomer and UFO investigator, though his alleged involvement remains speculative.
- **Wernher von Braun:** Rocket scientist, possibly consulted for advanced propulsion systems.

### **Conclusion**

The MAJESTIC-12 program represents one of the most significant and controversial elements of modern UFO history. While its existence remains unconfirmed in official records, a growing body of evidence, including credible testimony and leaked documents, points to the reality of a covert initiative tasked with managing extraterrestrial phenomena. MJ-12’s enduring legacy lies in its profound implications for humanity’s understanding of its place in the cosmos and the nature of the forces that have shaped our history.
