# The Ilkley Moor Encounter (1987)

**Summary:**  
The Ilkley Moor Encounter is one of the most enigmatic alien abduction cases in the United Kingdom. On December 1, 1987, retired police officer Philip Spencer was walking across Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire when he saw a small, humanoid being with an oversized head and long arms. Spencer managed to photograph the entity before it disappeared. He then experienced a period of missing time, during which he recalled being taken aboard a craft and shown vivid images of environmental destruction. The encounter is notable for the physical evidence of a photograph, the missing time, and Spencer’s subsequent physiological effects.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the morning of December 1, 1987, Philip Spencer was walking across Ilkley Moor, heading to visit family. Carrying a camera, he was navigating through the misty terrain when he saw a small, greenish-gray humanoid figure about 4 feet tall. The being had a large, bulbous head, long arms, and appeared to be beckoning him. Spencer raised his camera and captured a single photograph before the creature ran out of sight.

Chasing the being, Spencer came upon a strange, glowing craft rising silently into the sky. At this point, he experienced a sudden lapse in memory. He continued walking, disoriented, and discovered he had lost two hours of time. His compass, previously reliable, was behaving erratically, pointing in the wrong direction.

#### **Missing Time and Recall**

Under hypnotic regression, Spencer later recalled being taken aboard the craft by the humanoid being he had photographed. He described the interior as brightly lit and sterile, with advanced technology. The beings communicated telepathically, showing him images of Earth’s environmental degradation and warning of humanity’s potential self-destruction. The experience ended with Spencer being returned to the moor, with no immediate memory of what had occurred.
