# The Delphos Ring Case (1971)

 **Summary:**  
The Delphos Ring Case is a prominent UFO incident distinguished by its physical evidence and witness credibility. On the evening of November 2, 1971, 16-year-old Ron Johnson witnessed a glowing, mushroom-shaped object hovering over his family’s farm near Delphos, Kansas. After a few moments, the craft emitted a blinding light and ascended into the sky, leaving behind a glowing ring on the ground. The soil and vegetation within the ring displayed unusual characteristics that have been the subject of extensive scientific analysis. This case remains one of the most compelling examples of UFO-related physical evidence.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Delphos Ring Case is a cornerstone of UFO research due to the documented physical effects on the environment, which included soil hydrophobicity (repelling water), glowing properties, and plant abnormalities. The incident is often cited in discussions of trace evidence left behind by UFOs, reinforcing the hypothesis that these phenomena involve advanced technologies with measurable impacts.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the evening of November 2, 1971, Ron Johnson was outside tending to farm chores when he saw a bright, mushroom-shaped object descending into a nearby field. The object, about 8 feet in diameter, hovered approximately two feet above the ground and emitted a dazzling light. Its surface appeared metallic, glowing with hues of white, yellow, and red.

As Johnson approached, he experienced temporary blindness due to the brightness of the craft. After a few moments, the object emitted an intense burst of light and shot into the sky at incredible speed, disappearing from view. When his vision returned, he noticed a glowing ring on the ground where the craft had hovered.

#### **Family and Community Involvement**

Johnson immediately called his parents, who witnessed the glowing ring and the disturbed soil. The family contacted local authorities, who documented the site. News of the encounter spread, attracting UFO researchers and scientists who conducted tests on the affected area.

### **Physical Evidence**

1. **The Glowing Ring:**
    
    - The circular ring, about 8 feet in diameter, glowed faintly for several hours after the encounter.
    - The soil within the ring was found to be unusually dry and hydrophobic, repelling water.
2. **Vegetation Anomalies:**
    
    - Grass within the ring was discolored and brittle.
    - Over time, plants in the area displayed inhibited growth compared to surrounding vegetation.
3. **Chemical Changes:**
    
    - Soil samples analyzed by laboratories revealed unusual chemical and physical properties, including changes in organic material and mineral content.
    - The hydrophobicity of the soil persisted for years.
4. **Witness Effects:**
    
    - Ron Johnson reported temporary blindness and numbness in his hands after touching the glowing area, suggesting possible exposure to radiation or electromagnetic energy.

### **Investigations**

#### **Initial Inquiry**

Local law enforcement documented the case but deferred further investigation to UFO researchers. The Johnson family cooperated with multiple researchers, including those from the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) and private investigators.

#### **Scientific Analysis**

Several laboratories analyzed the soil and vegetation samples, with findings that included:

- Altered soil structure and composition.
- Persistent hydrophobicity inconsistent with natural phenomena.
- Evidence of intense heat or radiation exposure.

#### **Witness Credibility**

Ron Johnson’s credibility as a witness was repeatedly affirmed by investigators, as he was described as an honest and level-headed teenager with no history of seeking attention or fabricating stories.
