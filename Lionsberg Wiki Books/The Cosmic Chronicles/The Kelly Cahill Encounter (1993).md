### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the night of August 8, 1993, Kelly Cahill and her husband were returning home after visiting friends when they noticed a bright, circular craft in the sky. Moments later, the object appeared closer, hovering near the road. Its immense size and bright lights left Kelly in awe and fear. As the couple continued driving, they encountered the craft again, now landing in a field nearby.

Kelly described seeing several tall, black, humanoid beings with glowing red eyes emerging from the craft. These entities appeared to lack distinct features, resembling silhouettes or shadows. She reported an intense wave of dread as the beings seemed to focus on her.

#### **Missing Time and Physical Evidence**

Kelly and her husband found themselves suddenly back in their car, unable to recall how they got there. Upon returning home, Kelly discovered strange triangular marks on her abdomen and began experiencing vivid flashbacks of being on the craft. She recalled a brief but harrowing encounter with the beings, who seemed to perform examinations or experiments on her.
