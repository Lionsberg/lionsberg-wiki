Valentich vanished while flying a Cessna 182L over Bass Strait, reporting in his final transmissions to Melbourne Flight Service that he was being followed by a mysterious craft with bright lights and erratic movements. His last words—"It's not an aircraft"—followed by metallic scraping sounds, have fueled speculation about a possible UFO encounter. Despite extensive search efforts, neither Valentich nor his aircraft were ever found.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Flight and Final Transmissions**

On the evening of October 21, 1978, Frederick Valentich departed from Moorabbin Airport in Victoria, Australia, on a training flight to King Island in a Cessna 182L. At 7:06 PM, Valentich contacted Melbourne Flight Service, reporting an unidentified aircraft following him at 4,500 feet. He described the object as having four bright landing lights, a shiny metallic surface, and a green light.

Over the next several minutes, Valentich's transmissions became increasingly alarming. He described the craft as moving at high speeds, orbiting his plane, and performing erratic maneuvers. In his final transmission, Valentich reported, "It’s not an aircraft," followed by 17 seconds of metallic scraping sounds. Communication then ceased entirely.

#### **Search and Investigation**

An extensive search effort involving both air and sea was launched, covering over 1,000 square miles. Despite these efforts, no trace of Valentich or his aircraft was found. In 1983, an engine cowl flap consistent with Valentich’s Cessna was discovered washed ashore on Flinders Island, but its connection to the disappearance remains unverified.

The Australian Department of Transport’s investigation concluded that Valentich was presumed dead, but the cause of the disappearance could not be determined.
