# UFOs Over Colares Island, Brazil (1977)

**Summary:**  
The Colares Island UFO encounters of 1977 are among the most extraordinary and well-documented UFO cases in history. Over several months, residents of Colares, a small island in Pará, Brazil, reported intense activity involving glowing, unidentified craft that allegedly emitted beams of light, causing injuries and illness. Known locally as "Operation Saucer" (Operação Prato), the Brazilian military investigated, documenting the events with photographs, testimonies, and reports of physical effects. The encounters remain one of the most compelling cases of direct UFO interaction with civilians.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Colares Island incidents are notable for the volume of evidence, the involvement of military investigators, and the physical and psychological impact on witnesses. It stands as a rare example of an official government UFO investigation with publicly acknowledged findings.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Start of the Encounters**

In late 1977, residents of Colares began reporting sightings of glowing, disk- and cigar-shaped objects hovering over the island, particularly at night. The craft emitted bright beams of light that reportedly targeted individuals.

#### **Physical Effects on Witnesses**

Those struck by the beams described a variety of symptoms:

- **Burn Marks:** Circular burns on the skin, often on the chest, thighs, or face.
- **Fatigue and Weakness:** Many experienced profound lethargy after exposure.
- **Radiation Symptoms:** Some victims showed signs consistent with radiation poisoning, such as hair loss and skin lesions.
- **"Blood Drawn":** Witnesses claimed the beams seemed to extract blood from their bodies, leading to speculation about experiments or energy harvesting.

The phenomenon led to widespread panic, with many fleeing their homes or sleeping outdoors in groups to avoid being alone.

#### **Operation Saucer (Operação Prato)**

The Brazilian Air Force dispatched a team of military personnel to investigate under the codename "Operation Saucer." Led by Captain Uyrangê Bolivar Soares Nogueira de Hollanda Lima, the operation aimed to study and document the events.

- **Photographic Evidence:** The team captured numerous photographs of UFOs, including detailed images of luminous craft.
- **Eyewitness Testimony:** Soldiers and officers interviewed hundreds of witnesses, collecting a wealth of consistent accounts.
- **Direct Military Observation:** Some military personnel reported witnessing the objects themselves, adding to the case's credibility.

Despite extensive documentation, the official investigation ended abruptly, with the military concluding that the phenomenon posed no national security threat. Captain Hollanda later revealed that the closure of the operation was likely due to internal pressure and fear of public panic.

#### **Aftermath and Controversy**

Captain Hollanda's later interviews in the 1990s reignited interest in the case. He described the objects as "intelligently controlled" and admitted that the military had withheld information. His sudden death, officially ruled a suicide, has fueled further speculation about a cover-up.
