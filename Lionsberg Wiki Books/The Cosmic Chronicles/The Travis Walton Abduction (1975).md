# The Travis Walton Abduction (1975)

**Summary:**  
The Travis Walton Abduction is one of the most controversial and well-documented alien abduction cases in history. On November 5, 1975, Walton, a 22-year-old logger, vanished near Snowflake, Arizona, after a close encounter with a UFO witnessed by six coworkers. Walton reappeared five days later, disoriented and with fragmented memories of being aboard a craft. The case gained national attention due to its multiple witnesses, Walton's detailed recollections, and the polygraph tests taken by the logging crew. The incident remains a cornerstone of abduction research, polarizing skeptics and believers alike.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Walton abduction is unique for its combination of multiple witnesses, corroborated testimony, and the extraordinary circumstances of Walton's disappearance and return.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the evening of November 5, 1975, Travis Walton and his logging crew were driving home from a worksite in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest when they noticed a glowing disc-shaped craft hovering in a clearing. Walton, intrigued, exited the truck to get a closer look despite protests from his coworkers.

As Walton approached, a beam of blue light suddenly shot out from the craft, striking him and throwing him several feet into the air. Believing Walton to be dead, the terrified crew fled the scene but returned minutes later to find no sign of him. The craft had vanished, and so had Walton.

#### **The Five-Day Absence**

Walton's disappearance sparked a massive search involving law enforcement and volunteers. The logging crew's account of the event was met with skepticism, and they were subjected to polygraph tests, which they passed. The incident gained media attention, with some accusing the crew of foul play.

Five days later, Walton reappeared near a gas station, disoriented and confused. He had little memory of the time he was missing but later recalled being aboard a craft where humanoid beings and robotic figures conducted medical procedures on him. Walton described the interior of the craft as sterile, with advanced technology and a bright, pervasive light.
