# The Belgium UFO Wave (1989–1990)

**Summary:**  
The Belgium UFO Wave refers to a series of highly credible UFO sightings that occurred from late 1989 through early 1990, involving thousands of witnesses, military personnel, and law enforcement. The most notable events included reports of massive, triangular-shaped craft with bright lights moving silently across the sky. The sightings peaked on the night of March 30–31, 1990, when Belgian Air Force F-16 jets scrambled to intercept one of these objects, which displayed extraordinary flight maneuvers recorded on radar, which defied known aerodynamics. Despite extensive investigations, no conventional explanation has been provided, and the events remain a hallmark of modern UFO phenomena.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Belgium UFO Wave is significant for its combination of mass civilian sightings, corroboration by law enforcement and military radar, and the involvement of the Belgian Air Force. The events highlighted the limitations of contemporary aviation technology in confronting advanced aerial phenomena and added to the growing credibility of UFO encounters in the modern era.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Initial Sightings**

The wave began on November 29, 1989, when multiple witnesses reported seeing a large, triangular craft with three bright lights hovering or moving silently across the night sky. Law enforcement officers confirmed the sightings, and descriptions of the object remained consistent: a dark, triangular shape with rounded edges, capable of moving slowly or at astonishing speeds.

Over the following months, similar sightings were reported across Belgium, often involving multiple witnesses in both rural and urban areas.

#### **The Interception Attempt**

The most dramatic incident occurred on March 30–31, 1990, when Belgian Air Force radar stations tracked an unidentified object. Two F-16 jets were scrambled to intercept the craft. Pilots reported that the object performed maneuvers impossible for conventional aircraft, including instantaneous changes in altitude and direction at speeds exceeding human tolerance.

Despite radar locks, the craft repeatedly evaded interception by dropping altitude rapidly or vanishing entirely from radar. The Belgian Air Force publicly acknowledged the sightings and released radar data, stating that they could not identify the object.

### **Investigations**

- **Belgian Air Force Involvement:**
    - The Air Force openly investigated the incidents, providing radar data and pilot testimonies.
- **Skeptical Theories:**
    - Explanations ranged from misidentified aircraft to atmospheric phenomena, but these failed to account for the advanced maneuvers and radar evidence.
- **UFO Research Organizations:**
    - Groups like the Belgian Society for the Study of Space Phenomena (SOBEPS) conducted extensive studies, documenting hundreds of eyewitness accounts.
