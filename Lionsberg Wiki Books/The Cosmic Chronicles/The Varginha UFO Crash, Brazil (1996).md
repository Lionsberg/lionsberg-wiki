The Varginha UFO Crash, often called “Brazil’s Roswell,” is one of the most extraordinary UFO incidents in modern history.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Crash**

On the morning of January 20, 1996, witnesses observed a cigar-shaped object emitting smoke and flying erratically over Varginha, a small city in southeastern Brazil. According to local reports, the object crashed into a remote area, prompting a rapid response from military and firefighting units. Eyewitnesses described seeing vehicles transporting debris from the crash site under heavy guard.

#### **Alien Encounters**

Later that day, three young women—Lilian, Valquíria, and Kátia—encountered a strange creature near an empty lot. The being was described as approximately 5 feet tall, with brown, oily skin, a large head, red eyes, and ridges or protrusions on its skull. The creature appeared weak and frightened, crouching near a wall. The women fled in terror and later reported the incident to their families, sparking widespread attention in the media.

In the following days, additional sightings of similar beings were reported around the city, leading to speculation that one or more extraterrestrials had survived the crash.

#### **Military and Medical Involvement**

Witnesses claimed that Brazilian military personnel cordoned off the area where the alien beings were sighted. Allegedly, one of the beings was captured alive and transported to a local hospital for examination before being moved to a military facility. Hospital staff reportedly observed the being and described it as “unlike anything they had ever seen.”

Shortly after these events, reports emerged of another being’s body being transported to the University of Campinas for study. Military and government officials denied all allegations, attributing the sightings to local folklore and misidentified animals, but the consistency of witness testimonies has kept the case alive in public memory.
