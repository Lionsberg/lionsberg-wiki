# The Mothman Sightings (1966–1967)

**Summary:**  
The Mothman Sightings in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, from November 1966 to December 1967, are among the most iconic cases of cryptid encounters. Witnesses reported a large, humanoid creature with glowing red eyes and expansive wings, often seen flying or perching near remote areas like the TNT Area. The phenomena culminated in the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge on December 15, 1967, leading some to associate the Mothman with disaster warnings. These events have sparked decades of speculation, research, and cultural fascination.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Mothman Sightings blend cryptid lore, UFO phenomena, and potential precognition, creating one of the most complex and enigmatic cases in paranormal history. The overlap with other unexplained phenomena, including UFO sightings and Men in Black reports, suggests a broader context of interdimensional or extraterrestrial influence.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The First Sightings**

On November 12, 1966, five grave diggers in Clendenin, West Virginia, reported seeing a human-like figure with wings rise from a nearby tree. Just three days later, on November 15, two young couples—Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette—encountered a similar creature near an abandoned munitions plant known as the TNT Area. They described a 6–7 foot tall, grayish creature with glowing red eyes and wings that spanned nearly 10 feet.

The creature followed their car as they sped away, reportedly reaching speeds over 100 mph without flapping its wings. The terrified witnesses went straight to the police, whose investigation found no evidence but lent credibility to the event due to the witnesses’ visible distress.

#### **Ongoing Encounters**

In the months that followed, dozens of residents in and around Point Pleasant reported similar sightings. Patterns included:

- **Eyeshine:** Witnesses consistently described glowing red eyes.
- **Aerial Maneuvers:** Mothman was often seen flying or hovering without flapping its wings.
- **Proximity to Water and Remote Locations:** Many sightings occurred near the Ohio River or the TNT Area.

#### **The Silver Bridge Collapse**

On December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge connecting Point Pleasant to Gallipolis, Ohio, collapsed during rush hour, killing 46 people. Some locals claimed to have seen the Mothman near the bridge shortly before the disaster, leading to theories that it was a harbinger of doom or a warning of impending catastrophe.
