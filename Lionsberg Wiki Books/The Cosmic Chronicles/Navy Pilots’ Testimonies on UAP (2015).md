# Navy Pilots’ Testimonies on UAP (2015)

Between 2014 and 2015, U.S. Navy pilots operating from the USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) during training missions along the East Coast, from Virginia to Florida. These objects exhibited extraordinary flight characteristics, including hypersonic speeds and the ability to hover without visible propulsion systems. They were detected by multiple sensors, such as radar and infrared cameras, and were sometimes observed visually by the pilots.

Lieutenant Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot, reported that his squadron observed UAPs almost daily during this period. He described the objects as having no distinct wings, tails, or exhaust plumes, and noted that they could remain airborne for extended periods, surpassing the capabilities of known manned aircraft.

In one incident, a pilot recounted a near-collision with a UAP, describing it as a "dark or grey cube inside a clear sphere." This object reportedly flew between two aircraft at close range, prompting safety concerns among the aviators.

These encounters were captured in several videos, including the well-known "GIMBAL" and "GOFAST" footage, which were officially acknowledged by the U.S. Department of Defense in April 2020. The videos show objects performing maneuvers that defy conventional aeronautics, such as sudden accelerations and changes in direction without apparent means of propulsion.

The frequency and nature of these sightings led to the U.S. Navy updating its protocols in 2015 to encourage pilots to report UAP encounters without fear of stigma, aiming to better understand these phenomena and address potential safety and security risks.

These testimonies and documented encounters have played a significant role in prompting further investigations into UAPs by governmental bodies, highlighting the need for transparency and scientific inquiry into these unexplained aerial phenomena.
