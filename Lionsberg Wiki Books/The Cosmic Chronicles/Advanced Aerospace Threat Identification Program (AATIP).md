# Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)

The **Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)** was a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) initiative which emerged as a continuation and refinement of the broader **AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program)** initiative launched in 2007, tasked with investigating unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) with potential national security implications. AATIP primarily focused on encounters between UAPs and U.S. military assets, analyzing their advanced capabilities, origins, and possible threats. The program was led by Luis Elizondo and operated until (?), though its legacy influenced subsequent UAP research initiatives.

Unlike its predecessor, **AAWSAP**, which investigated a broader range of anomalous phenomena, AATIP narrowed its scope to UAPs with military and national security relevance.
____
AATIP coordinated with contractors, including **Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS)**, for research and analysis of UAP-related materials.

### **Public Disclosure and Legacy**

1. **Resignation of Luis Elizondo:**
    
    - In 2017, Elizondo resigned from the DoD, citing a lack of seriousness in addressing the UAP issue.
    - His resignation letter emphasized the importance of investigating UAPs as a national security concern.
2. **Media Revelations:**
    
    - In December 2017, the **New York Times** published an article revealing AATIP’s existence, sparking public and media interest in UAP phenomena.
    - Videos of UAP encounters, including the **Gimbal**, **GoFast**, and **FLIR1 (Tic Tac)**, were declassified and released, fueling global discussions.
3. **Influence on UAP Research:**
    
    - AATIP’s revelations led to the creation of the **UAP Task Force (UAPTF)** in 2020, followed by the **All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)** in 2022.
    - The program laid the groundwork for congressional hearings on UAPs, including testimony from military personnel and intelligence officials.

### **Key Findings**

1. **Capabilities Beyond Known Technology:**
    
    - AATIP documented UAPs with performance characteristics that exceeded known human capabilities, including:
        - Hypersonic travel without detectable propulsion.
        - Instantaneous directional changes.
        - Resistance to gravitational forces.
2. **National Security Risks:**
    
    - The program concluded that UAPs posed potential risks, particularly to military operations and airspace security.
3. **Unanswered Questions:**
    
    - AATIP left many questions unresolved, including the origin and intent of UAPs, as well as the nature of their advanced technologies.

### **Significance**

AATIP represented a pivotal moment in UAP research, shifting the conversation from fringe speculation to mainstream defense and scientific inquiry. While much of its work remains classified, the program’s revelations have prompted renewed interest in UAPs, their implications for national security, and humanity’s place in the cosmos.
