# The Westall UFO Encounter (1966)

**Summary:**  
The Westall UFO Encounter is one of the most credible and well-documented mass UFO sightings in modern history. On April 6, 1966, over 200 students and teachers at Westall High School in Melbourne, Australia, observed a metallic, saucer-shaped craft hovering over their schoolyard. The object descended into a nearby field, leaving behind scorched grass and strange impressions, before ascending at incredible speed and disappearing. Despite immediate military and governmental involvement, as well as conflicting official explanations, the sheer number of witnesses and the physical evidence make Westall a landmark event in UFO history.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Westall UFO Encounter stands out for its mass of witnesses, physical traces, and reports of governmental suppression of evidence. It raises critical questions about institutional responses to unexplained phenomena and offers a rare opportunity to study the societal impact of UFO events.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the late morning of April 6, 1966, students and staff at Westall High School noticed an unusual object in the sky. Described as metallic and disc-shaped, the craft hovered silently before descending into an open field nearby, known as The Grange. Witnesses who approached the site reported seeing the object resting on the ground for several minutes. The craft left scorched grass and mysterious impressions in the field.

As the onlookers watched, the craft tilted slightly, emitted a faint hum, and shot into the sky at an astonishing speed, joined by at least one other similar object. The event lasted approximately 20 minutes, but its impact would reverberate for decades.

#### **Government and Military Involvement**

Soon after the craft’s departure, military personnel arrived at the scene, cordoning off the area and allegedly removing evidence. Witnesses reported being warned not to discuss the incident, and some claimed that their accounts were suppressed or altered. No clear explanation was provided, with initial suggestions ranging from weather balloons to experimental aircraft.
