### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter in the Park**

On the evening of September 27, 1989, children playing in a park near Levoberezhny Street in Voronezh noticed a bright red ball of light in the sky. The object grew larger as it descended, eventually landing in the park. Witnesses described the craft as a large, disk-like object with a glowing surface, emanating an intense light.

Shortly after landing, witnesses reported seeing three humanoid figures emerge from the craft. The primary figure was described as a towering, humanoid being with elongated limbs, clad in a metallic suit. It was accompanied by a smaller, robot-like entity. The beings reportedly carried a glowing sphere or device that seemed to exert a paralyzing effect on some witnesses.

#### **Interaction with Witnesses**

Eyewitness accounts, primarily from children but corroborated by adults, described a surreal interaction. Some witnesses claimed that the larger humanoid used a beam of light to paralyze a boy, only to revive him moments later. The entities then reportedly re-entered the craft, which rose into the sky and disappeared.
