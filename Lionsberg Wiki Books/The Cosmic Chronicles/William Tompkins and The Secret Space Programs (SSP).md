# William Tompkins and The Secret Space Programs (SSP)

**Summary:**  
William Tompkins, a former aerospace engineer and naval intelligence operative, emerged in recent years as a central figure in the disclosure movement, making extraordinary claims about the existence of secret space programs (SSP) and humanity's decades-long interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations. According to Tompkins, he worked on advanced aerospace designs inspired by extraterrestrial technology, participated in intelligence-gathering efforts about Nazi collaboration with aliens during World War II, and contributed to the development of a U.S. space fleet capable of interstellar travel. His testimony links military, corporate, and extraterrestrial efforts in one of the most audacious narratives of hidden history ever proposed.

**Why It Matters:**  
Tompkins’s revelations, though controversial, provide a detailed account of covert human-extraterrestrial interactions and technological advancements. His testimony connects multiple strands of UFO and SSP narratives, including Operation Paperclip, reverse engineering of alien craft, and global elite agendas. Whether wholly true or partly speculative, his claims have fueled significant debate and investigation into secretive aerospace activities and alien involvement in Earth’s affairs.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Background and Credentials**

William Tompkins began his career in World War II as part of a Navy intelligence group tasked with analyzing intelligence reports about Nazi UFO-like craft. After the war, he transitioned into the aerospace industry, working for companies like Douglas Aircraft and contributing to early space exploration projects. His background includes significant work on classified programs, including the design of advanced propulsion systems and space-faring vehicles.

#### **Key Claims**

1. **Nazi Collaboration with Extraterrestrials:**  
    Tompkins alleged that during World War II, the Nazis entered into agreements with a reptilian extraterrestrial species, receiving advanced technology to build anti-gravity craft and other innovations. These craft, often referred to as "flying saucers," were reportedly developed in secret bases, including those in Antarctica.
    
2. **Naval Intelligence Operations:**  
    As part of a secret naval intelligence initiative, Tompkins claimed he helped disseminate intelligence about Nazi UFO projects to major U.S. aerospace companies. This information was allegedly used to jumpstart American programs to counteract Nazi advancements and develop a U.S. space fleet.
    
3. **Reverse Engineering and Extraterrestrial Guidance:**  
    Tompkins described how U.S. aerospace engineers were tasked with reverse-engineering alien craft recovered from crashes like Roswell. He also claimed that extraterrestrial "Nordic" beings were embedded within U.S. programs, subtly guiding humanity's efforts to develop space travel technologies.
    
4. **Development of the Secret Space Program:**  
    According to Tompkins, the U.S. developed a fleet of massive interstellar spacecraft, capable of operating beyond Earth's orbit. These ships were built in part through collaborations with extraterrestrial entities and utilized propulsion systems far more advanced than conventional rocket technology.
    
5. **Extraterrestrial Threats and Alliances:**  
    Tompkins asserted that Earth is part of a broader interstellar conflict involving multiple alien species. He described a "galactic battle" in which human factions, assisted by benevolent extraterrestrials, opposed the malevolent reptilian species collaborating with the Nazis.
