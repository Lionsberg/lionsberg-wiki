# The Maury Island Incident (1947)

**Summary:**  
The Maury Island Incident is one of the earliest and most controversial UFO cases, involving strange metallic debris, mysterious flying objects, and alleged government intimidation. On June 21, 1947, Harold Dahl claimed to witness six doughnut-shaped crafts near Maury Island, Washington. One of the objects ejected molten metal-like material, damaging Dahl’s boat and injuring his dog. This case not only predates Roswell but also introduced elements of secrecy, manipulation, and threats—hallmarks of UFO lore—including what some believe to be the first appearance of the enigmatic “Men in Black.”

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Sighting**

On June 21, 1947, Harold Dahl, a harbor patrolman, was on his boat near Maury Island in Puget Sound when he observed six doughnut-shaped objects in the sky. The crafts hovered silently, one appearing damaged and wobbling in the air. As Dahl watched, the damaged craft ejected molten material, which rained down on the water and struck his boat. The debris injured Dahl’s son and killed the family dog. The objects then flew away, leaving Dahl and his crew shaken.

#### **The Report**

Dahl reported the incident to his supervisor, Fred Crisman, who investigated the site and confirmed the presence of strange debris. Crisman later claimed to see one of the crafts himself. The story gained traction after Dahl contacted a local newspaper, and Kenneth Arnold (of "flying saucer" fame) was asked to investigate.

#### **The Men in Black**

Shortly after reporting the incident, Dahl was allegedly approached by a man in a dark suit who warned him not to speak about what he had seen. This encounter is often considered the first recorded appearance of the “Men in Black,” figures associated with UFO-related intimidation and secrecy.

#### **The Tragic Fallout**

When military investigators Captain William Davidson and Lieutenant Frank Brown collected samples of the debris, their B-25 bomber mysteriously crashed en route to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, killing both men. The loss of evidence and the deaths of the investigators added an aura of conspiracy to the case. Dahl and Crisman later recanted their story under mysterious circumstances, further deepening suspicions of coercion or foul play.
