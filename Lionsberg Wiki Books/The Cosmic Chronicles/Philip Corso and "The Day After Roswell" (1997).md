### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Corso’s Role and Claims**

Philip Corso served in the Pentagon’s Foreign Technology Division during the 1960s under General Arthur Trudeau. Corso claimed he was entrusted with artifacts recovered from the Roswell crash, housed in a top-secret repository at the Pentagon.

- **Roswell Artifacts:**  
    Items allegedly recovered included ultra-thin, memory-retaining metal; flexible circuits; energy-amplifying devices; and biologically compatible materials.
    
- **Seeding Technology:**  
    Corso’s main responsibility was to distribute these artifacts to defense contractors under the guise of foreign technology, prompting reverse-engineering efforts.
    
- **Breakthroughs Linked to Roswell:**  
    Corso attributed several modern technologies to the recovered artifacts:
    
    - **Fiber Optics**: Derived from alien communication systems.
    - **Integrated Circuits**: Inspired by alien control panels.
    - **Night Vision**: Based on alien ocular technologies.
    - **Kevlar**: Possibly influenced by alien biological containment materials.

#### **The Broader Implications**

Corso contended that the Roswell crash marked a turning point in human technological evolution, catalyzing the development of advanced military systems. He also suggested that the military-industrial complex deliberately concealed these origins to maintain dominance over rival nations and the public.

#### **Aliens as a Strategic Threat**

Corso viewed extraterrestrials not merely as visitors but as a strategic threat. He described the Roswell entities as humanoid but biologically engineered, possibly serving as probes or tools for a more advanced intelligence.
