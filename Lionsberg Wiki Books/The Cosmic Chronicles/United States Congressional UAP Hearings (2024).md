# United States Congressional UAP Hearings (2024)

### **Introduction**

The 2024 United States Congressional hearings on UFOs, officially referred to as **UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena)**, marked another critical moment in government disclosure efforts surrounding this controversial subject. Following the momentum of 2023, these hearings featured testimony from whistleblowers, government officials, scientists, and journalists. The proceedings illuminated alleged clandestine programs, whistleblower protections, and the enduring mystery of non-human technologies.

### **Major Topics Discussed**

#### **1. Whistleblower Protections**

- The hearings highlighted the importance of protecting individuals revealing classified UAP information.
- Testimonies emphasized fears of career-ending retaliation and physical harm.
- Discussions centered on whether current whistleblower protections adequately covered those coming forward about UAPs.

#### **2. Allegations of Clandestine Programs**

- Claims included secretive crash retrievals, reverse engineering, and the concealment of technologies potentially transformative for humanity.

#### **3. Scientific and Military Implications**

- Testimonies included reports of advanced technologies defying known physics, such as:
    - Objects traveling at hypersonic speeds without visible propulsion.
    - Craft performing instant directional changes.
    - Radar invisibility and advanced material composition.
- Military witnesses reported encounters with objects demonstrating these capabilities.

#### **4. Congressional Oversight Challenges**

- Persistent barriers to oversight were noted, including:
    - Classification levels exceeding those accessible to most members of Congress.
    - Non-disclosure agreements imposed on witnesses.
    - Deliberate misclassification or obfuscation of UAP-related programs.
