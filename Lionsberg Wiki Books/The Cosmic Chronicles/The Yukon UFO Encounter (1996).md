# The Yukon UFO Encounter (1996)

**Summary:**  
On December 11, 1996, residents of several small communities in Yukon, Canada, reported witnessing an enormous, silent craft with bright lights hovering and slowly moving across the night sky. Descriptions of the craft included comparisons to "a flying city" due to its sheer size and complexity. Multiple independent witnesses provided consistent accounts, making the Yukon UFO Encounter one of the most credible mass sightings in Canadian UFO history.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Yukon UFO Encounter stands out for its large number of credible witnesses, consistent descriptions of an enormous, structured craft, and the absence of any conventional explanation. The case remains a cornerstone of Canadian UFOlogy and contributes to global discussions about the phenomenon of massive, low-altitude UFOs.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Sightings**

On the cold, clear evening of December 11, 1996, residents of Fox Lake, Carmacks, Pelly Crossing, and other communities in the Yukon reported seeing a large, brightly lit object in the sky. The craft was described as enormous—witnesses compared it to the size of a football field or larger.

- **Fox Lake:**  
    Multiple witnesses in Fox Lake described a massive craft with rows of rectangular lights moving slowly over the frozen lake. The lights were described as steady and white, illuminating the craft’s underside.
    
- **Carmacks and Pelly Crossing:**  
    In nearby communities, other witnesses observed the same or similar craft, corroborating the descriptions from Fox Lake. The object moved silently, without producing any noticeable noise or disrupting the environment.
    

#### **Witness Descriptions**

The consistency of witness accounts is one of the most striking aspects of the Yukon UFO Encounter. Key features include:

- A structured craft with visible edges and panels.
- Rows of bright, rectangular lights emitting steady illumination.
- The craft’s enormous size, dwarfing any known aircraft.

#### **Aftermath**

Witnesses reported feeling awe and confusion. Many were convinced they had seen something extraordinary, beyond human technology. The event gained attention from Canadian UFO researchers and was documented extensively in reports by the Ufology Research of Manitoba.
