# The Wilson-Davis Memo Leak (2019)

### **Introduction**

The **Wilson-Davis Memo**, leaked in **2019**, refers to alleged notes taken by astrophysicist **Dr. Eric Davis** documenting a **2002** conversation with former **Admiral Thomas R. Wilson**, then the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). These notes, often referred to as the "Wilson-Davis documents," describe Wilson’s purported discovery of a deeply classified program involving reverse engineering of non-human technology. If authentic, which researchers such as George Knapp have confirmed, the memo provides a rare glimpse into the U.S. government's clandestine efforts to study advanced, possibly extraterrestrial technology and its compartmentalization within private industry.

### **Background**

1. **Key Figures:**
    
    - **Admiral Thomas R. Wilson:**
        - A high-ranking U.S. Navy officer and former Director of the DIA.
        - Allegedly became aware of a classified reverse-engineering program during his tenure as J-2, the Director of Intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    - **Dr. Eric W. Davis:**
        - A renowned astrophysicist and defense contractor, associated with programs like **AAWSAP** and **AATIP**.
        - Allegedly met with Wilson in 2002 to discuss the classified program.
2. **The Memo's Emergence:**
    
    - First leaked online in **April 2019**, the memo was included in documents associated with the estate of the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell, an Apollo 14 astronaut and prominent UAP disclosure advocate.
    - Its contents quickly became a focal point for UAP researchers, generating both intrigue and skepticism.

### **Key Claims in the Memo**

1. **Discovery of a Secret Program:**
    
    - Wilson reportedly uncovered a **Special Access Program (SAP)** during a routine review of classified projects.
    - The program was allegedly managed by a private aerospace contractor and involved the reverse engineering of non-human technology.
2. **Denial of Access:**
    
    - Wilson claimed he was denied access to the program, despite his high security clearance and role as J-2.
    - The program's administrators allegedly stated that he did not have a "need to know."
3. **Reverse Engineering of Non-Human Technology:**
    
    - The memo describes Wilson’s understanding that the SAP involved attempts to reverse engineer a craft of unknown origin.
    - The craft was reportedly not of human design and was described as "technological, not natural."
4. **Extreme Secrecy and Compartmentalization:**
    
    - Wilson expressed frustration over the program’s compartmentalization and its lack of oversight by traditional government structures.
    - The memo suggests that the program operated under the guise of private-sector projects to evade scrutiny.
5. **Acknowledgement of Crashed Craft:**
    
    - The memo includes references to "crash retrievals" and advanced technology recovery, which aligns with claims made by other whistleblowers and researchers.

### **Reactions and Controversy**

1. **Wilson’s Denial:**
    
    - Admiral Wilson has publicly denied the authenticity of the memo, stating he never had such a conversation with Dr. Davis.
    - He also denied knowledge of or involvement in any reverse-engineering program involving non-human technology.
2. **Support from UAP Researchers:**
    
    - Prominent UAP investigators, including **Richard Dolan** and **Dr. Hal Puthoff**, have suggested the memo aligns with longstanding claims of hidden crash retrieval programs.
    - Dr. Davis has declined to confirm or deny the memo’s authenticity, further fueling speculation.
3. **Skepticism:**
    
    - Critics argue the memo lacks verifiable evidence and point out inconsistencies in Wilson’s purported statements.
    - Some suggest the memo could be a forgery or an exaggerated account of informal conversations.

### **Key Questions Raised**

1. **Existence of the Program:**
    - Does a classified program for reverse engineering non-human technology exist, as alleged in the memo?
2. **Private Sector Involvement:**
    - How deeply embedded are private contractors in managing UAP-related projects, and what level of government oversight exists?
3. **National Security and Transparency:**
    - What are the implications of such programs for national security, and should they be subject to greater Congressional or public oversight?

### **Impact on UAP Disclosure**

1. **Catalyst for Public Interest:**
    - The leak intensified calls for transparency regarding UAP programs and their management by both government and private entities.
2. **Support for Whistleblowers:**
    - The memo provided context for subsequent whistleblower claims, including those made by **David Grusch** in 2023 about crash retrieval programs.
3. **Focus on Compartmentalization:**
    - The memo highlights the extreme compartmentalization and secrecy surrounding potential UAP-related initiatives, raising questions about accountability.

### **Conclusion**

The **Wilson-Davis Memo** remains a pivotal document in the realm of UAP research. While its authenticity and claims have not been conclusively verified, the memo has amplified scrutiny of secretive U.S. government and private-sector activities concerning advanced, potentially non-human technologies. Whether a genuine account or a compelling and near-truthful narrative, the Wilson-Davis Memo underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in understanding humanity’s interaction with the unknown.
