# The Tully Saucer Nest (1966)

**Summary:**  
The Tully Saucer Nest is a renowned UFO case that occurred in Horseshoe Lagoon near Tully, Queensland, Australia. On January 19, 1966, a farmer named George Pedley reported seeing a metallic, disc-shaped object rise silently from a lagoon and vanish into the sky. Upon inspection, Pedley discovered a large, flattened circle of reeds in the water, which appeared to have been formed by a powerful force. The incident garnered international attention and is often cited as one of the earliest and most credible cases involving "crop circles" or similar physical trace phenomena.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Tully Saucer Nest is significant because it combines a credible eyewitness account with compelling physical evidence. This case was pivotal in connecting UFO sightings to physical environmental changes and is considered a precursor to modern crop circle phenomena.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

In the early morning hours of January 19, 1966, George Pedley was driving a tractor near Horseshoe Lagoon, an area of swamps and sugarcane fields. Pedley noticed a strange, metallic object rising silently from the lagoon. The object, described as circular and metallic, ascended vertically before speeding off at an extraordinary rate into the sky.

Intrigued and unnerved, Pedley approached the lagoon to investigate. He discovered a large, circular area where the reeds had been flattened and swirled in a clockwise direction. The area, approximately 30 feet in diameter, was neatly pressed down, forming a floating "nest" that stood out starkly against the surrounding vegetation.

#### **Physical Evidence**

1. **Reed Nest Formation:**
    
    - A perfect circular area of flattened reeds was discovered at the site where the craft was seen.
    - The reeds were intertwined and swirled in a way that suggested exposure to a strong rotational force.
    - Despite being submerged, the nest retained its shape for days, resisting natural degradation.
2. **Water Disturbances:**
    
    - Witnesses who later examined the site observed unusual rippling patterns in the water, as if the area had been subjected to sudden turbulence.
3. **Soil Analysis:**
    
    - Subsequent investigations found no signs of human intervention or mechanical equipment that could have created the nest.
    - The reeds appeared to have been flattened with precision, without breaking their stems.

#### **Investigations**

#### **Eyewitness Testimony**

- George Pedley’s account remained consistent over time, and his reputation as a practical and reliable farmer lent credibility to the sighting.

#### **Media and Public Attention**

- The story quickly captured the attention of local and international media.
- Researchers and UFO investigators descended on the site, documenting the nest and interviewing witnesses.

#### **Scientific Explanations**

- Some skeptics suggested natural causes, such as a whirlpool, gusts of wind, or animal activity. However, these theories failed to account for the precision and symmetry of the nest or the lack of similar disturbances in the area.

#### **Link to UFO Activity**

- Local residents reported other UFO sightings in the area around the same time, lending further weight to the possibility of an extraterrestrial encounter.
