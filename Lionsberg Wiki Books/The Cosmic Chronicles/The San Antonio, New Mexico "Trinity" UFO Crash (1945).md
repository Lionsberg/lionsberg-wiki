# The San Antonio, New Mexico "Trinity" UFO Crash (1945)

**Summary:**  
The San Antonio, New Mexico UFO Crash, also referred to as the “Trinity Crash,” occurred in August 1945, mere weeks after the first atomic bomb test at the nearby Trinity site. Two young boys, José Padilla and Reme Baca, witnessed a strange craft crash on a remote ranch. The object, described as an oval-shaped metallic craft, left an impression in the terrain and reportedly contained small humanoid beings. Military personnel swiftly arrived, securing the site and removing the wreckage. The case has drawn renewed attention for its potential connection to heightened UFO activity following nuclear events.

**Why It Matters:**  
The San Antonio crash is notable for its timing, occurring just after the Trinity nuclear test, and for being one of the earliest documented UFO crashes in modern history. It offers critical insights into the relationship between nuclear activity and UFO phenomena, as well as early government responses to unidentified aerial craft.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

In August 1945, 9-year-old José Padilla and 7-year-old Reme Baca were tending cattle on a ranch near San Antonio, New Mexico. They heard a loud explosion and saw an object crash into the earth. Upon approaching the site, they discovered an oval-shaped metallic craft partially embedded in the ground. The craft was damaged but intact, with a shiny, reflective surface.

The boys reported seeing small, humanoid beings moving inside the craft through a broken opening. The beings were described as having large heads and thin bodies, with no apparent clothing. They appeared disoriented or injured.

#### **Military Response**

Within hours, the military arrived, securing the site and warning the boys to leave. Soldiers cordoned off the area, removed the craft using heavy equipment, and transported it to an unknown location. Witnesses later reported that the military downplayed the event, attributing the crash to a weather balloon or experimental aircraft.

#### **Aftermath and Rediscovery**

The story remained largely unknown until decades later, when investigative journalist Paola Harris and physicist Dr. Jacques Vallée brought the case to public attention. Their interviews with Padilla and Baca provided a detailed account of the incident, including descriptions of the craft, the beings, and the military’s actions.
