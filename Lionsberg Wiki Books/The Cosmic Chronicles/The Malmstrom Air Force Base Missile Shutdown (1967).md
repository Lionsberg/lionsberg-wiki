# The Malmstrom Air Force Base Missile Shutdown (1967)

**Summary:**  
The Malmstrom Air Force Base Missile Shutdown is a compelling UFO case involving the unprecedented and unexplained deactivation of nuclear missiles at a U.S. Air Force installation in Montana. On March 24, 1967, multiple witnesses, including Air Force personnel, reported sightings of a glowing, red-orange UFO hovering near the base. Shortly thereafter, ten Minuteman nuclear missiles in a launch facility suddenly went offline, leaving no technical explanation. The case highlights the intersection of UFO phenomena with nuclear security and raises profound questions about extraterrestrial interest in human weaponry.

**Why It Matters:**  
This event is one of the most credible UFO incidents due to the involvement of military witnesses, the direct impact on nuclear weapons, and the documentation of the event in declassified government reports. It underscores a pattern of UFOs interacting with or disabling nuclear technology, suggesting an interest in humanity’s capacity for mass destruction.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Incident**

On March 24, 1967, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, multiple security personnel stationed at the Oscar Flight Launch Control Center reported seeing a glowing, red-orange object hovering just outside the restricted area of the base. Guards described the UFO as silent, spherical, and pulsating with an intense, fiery light.

Simultaneously, alarms in the control center sounded, indicating a sudden loss of functionality in all ten Minuteman nuclear missiles under their watch. These missiles, critical to U.S. national defense during the Cold War, were designed with redundant fail-safes to prevent simultaneous deactivation. However, within moments of the UFO’s appearance, they all went offline.

Efforts to diagnose and repair the issue were met with confusion, as technicians could find no physical or technical faults in the missile systems. Despite rigorous protocols and testing, the missiles remained non-operational for hours.

#### **Witness Reports**

Robert Salas, a launch officer on duty that night, later disclosed that his team was instructed to maintain silence about the event. Salas reported receiving calls from security guards describing the UFO as "large and glowing," and that they were visibly shaken. Other personnel corroborated these sightings, lending credibility to the claims.

### **Physical and Psychological Evidence**

- **Missile Malfunction:**
    - Comprehensive diagnostics revealed no technical cause for the shutdown.
- **Witness Reactions:**
    - Guards and control room staff were visibly shaken and distressed by the event.
- **Documentation:**
    - Declassified Air Force documents confirm the incident and the missile malfunctions.

### **Investigations**

- **Air Force Response:**
    - The Air Force investigated the incident but officially attributed the missile shutdown to "equipment malfunction," despite a lack of evidence supporting this explanation.
- **Robert Salas’ Testimony:**
    - In later years, Salas came forward to discuss the event, advocating for disclosure about UFO interactions with nuclear technology.
- **Skeptical Theories:**
    - Skeptics have proposed electromagnetic interference or system errors, though such theories fail to explain the simultaneous, system-wide failure of redundant missile systems.

### **Outcome and Significance**

- **National Security Implications:**
    - The event demonstrated a potential vulnerability in critical defense systems.
- **Pattern of UFO-Nuclear Interactions:**
    - The Malmstrom case is part of a broader pattern of UFOs appearing near nuclear facilities, suggesting a deliberate interest in humanity’s nuclear capabilities.
- **Call for Disclosure:**
    - The case has been cited by advocates for government transparency on UFO phenomena.
