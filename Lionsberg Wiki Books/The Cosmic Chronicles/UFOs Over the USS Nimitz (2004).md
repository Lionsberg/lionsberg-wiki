# UFOs Over the USS Nimitz (2004)

**Summary:**  
The 2004 USS _Nimitz_ UFO encounters, commonly referred to as the "Tic Tac" incident, involved highly credible sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) by Navy personnel. Over several days in November 2004, the USS _Princeton_ tracked anomalous craft with extraordinary speed, agility, and transmedium capabilities. Fighter pilots from the USS _Nimitz_, including Navy Aviator Commander David Fravor, observed the Tic Tac-shaped craft up close during a 6-minute engagement. The object demonstrated advanced technology far beyond any known human capabilities. This event, corroborated by radar, pilot testimony, and video evidence, represents a cornerstone in modern UFO investigations, sparking public and governmental interest worldwide.

**Why It Matters:**  
The USS _Nimitz_ encounters exemplify the technological superiority of unidentified craft, their apparent interest in military operations, and the inability of current defense systems to match their capabilities. The incident gained unprecedented attention with the Pentagon’s declassification of video evidence and testimony from high-ranking military officials before U.S. Congress.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Extended Radar Tracking**

In early November 2004, radar operators aboard the USS _Princeton_, part of the USS _Nimitz_ Carrier Strike Group, began tracking unidentified objects over the Pacific Ocean near San Diego. These craft exhibited erratic flight patterns, hovering one moment and moving at hypersonic speeds the next. Over a two-week period, operators noted the objects' ability to descend from altitudes of 80,000 feet to just above sea level in seconds—maneuvers beyond the capability of any known aircraft.

On November 14, radar operators detected an object near the group, prompting the USS _Nimitz_ to scramble two F/A-18 Super Hornets to intercept. Pilots and radar systems had a combined visual and instrumented tracking duration of 6 minutes.

#### **The Close Encounter**

Commander David Fravor, one of the pilots, visually confirmed the object as a 40-foot-long, white, oblong craft resembling a Tic Tac. The craft hovered above the water, seemingly interacting with something beneath the ocean’s surface. Fravor attempted to close the distance, but the object reacted with intelligent precision, mirroring his movements. When Fravor began a descending maneuver, the craft accelerated instantaneously, disappearing from sight.

Moments later, the USS _Princeton_ radar operators picked up the object 60 miles away—less than 60 seconds after it disappeared. This implies speeds exceeding 3,600 mph, possibly faster considering radar sweep intervals.

A second pair of F/A-18s launched later captured the infamous FLIR1 video, showing the craft’s extraordinary maneuverability and speed.

### **Key Observations**

- **UFO Description:**
    - Tic Tac-shaped, approximately 40 feet long, with no visible propulsion system or exhaust.
    - Displayed intelligent control and transmedium capabilities (air to underwater interaction).
- **Aerial Capabilities:**
    - Descended from 80,000 feet to near sea level in seconds.
    - Demonstrated hypersonic speeds and instantaneous directional changes.
- **Underwater Interaction:**
    - Fravor and radar operators suggested an underwater object beneath the Tic Tac during the encounter.

### **Physical and Psychological Evidence**

- **Radar and Sensor Data:**
    - Aegis radar systems aboard the USS _Princeton_ and other advanced sensors confirmed the object’s extraordinary maneuvers.
- **Pilot Testimonies:**
    - Commander David Fravor described the craft as displaying “far superior” technology compared to U.S. military capabilities.
- **Infrared Footage:**
    - The FLIR1 video, later declassified by the Pentagon, remains a key piece of evidence in UFO studies.

### **Investigations**

- **Pentagon Acknowledgment:**
    - The Department of Defense confirmed the incident was part of its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and publicly released the FLIR1 video.
- **Extended Tracking:**
    - The USS _Princeton_ had tracked similar objects for two weeks prior to the intercept mission, documenting their extraordinary capabilities.
- **Public Testimony:**
    - Commander Fravor and other crew members have testified to the event’s authenticity before Congress and in public interviews.
- **Skeptical Theories:**
    - Explanations such as radar glitches or experimental aircraft fail to account for the combination of visual, radar, and infrared evidence.

### **Outcome and Significance**

- **Technological Disparity:**
    - The Tic Tac craft demonstrated capabilities far exceeding current human technology.
- **National Security Concerns:**
    - The inability of the U.S. military to track or engage these objects effectively underscores potential defense vulnerabilities.
- **Global Impact:**
    - The incident reignited global interest in UFO phenomena, influencing governmental transparency and sparking new investigations.
