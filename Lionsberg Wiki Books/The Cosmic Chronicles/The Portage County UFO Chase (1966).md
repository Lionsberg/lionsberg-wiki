# The Portage County UFO Chase (1966)

**Summary:**  
The Portage County UFO Chase is one of the most dramatic UFO encounters on record, involving a high-speed pursuit by law enforcement officers across multiple counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania on April 17, 1966. Deputies Dale Spaur and Wilbur "Barney" Neff witnessed a glowing, disc-shaped object that rose from a nearby field and accelerated into the sky. What began as a routine investigation turned into a harrowing 86-mile chase, with the officers following the object at speeds exceeding 100 mph. The event remains a cornerstone case in UFO history, marked by credible witnesses, official denials, and lasting psychological impacts on those involved.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter Begins**

At approximately 5:00 AM on April 17, 1966, Deputies Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff were investigating an abandoned vehicle on a rural road near Ravenna, Ohio. As they completed their inspection, a brilliant light in the sky caught their attention. The object, described as a metallic disc with a glowing underside, descended and hovered over a nearby field. The deputies observed the craft as it emitted a humming sound and slowly rose into the air.

When the object began to move, the deputies decided to follow it, initiating what would become a high-speed chase spanning two states. The craft maintained a consistent altitude and speed, occasionally darting ahead or slowing down as if aware of its pursuers. Spaur later described the object as "huge" and "bright like a spotlight."

#### **The Pursuit Escalates**

The chase quickly gained attention from other officers. Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua joined in briefly, capturing photographs of the object, though the images were later deemed inconclusive. As the pursuit continued into Pennsylvania, the craft appeared to slow down near Conway, where a state trooper, Frank Panzanella, observed it hovering before it rapidly ascended and disappeared.

The deputies, exhausted and confused, ended their chase after 86 miles, reporting the incident to their superiors.
