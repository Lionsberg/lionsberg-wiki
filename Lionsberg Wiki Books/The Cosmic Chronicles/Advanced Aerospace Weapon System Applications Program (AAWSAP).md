# Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) (2007-2012)

### **Introduction**

The **Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)** was a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) initiative launched in 2007 to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and related advanced technologies. Funded with $22 million from the U.S. government's black budget, AAWSAP was the most expansive U.S. government program dedicated to exploring anomalous phenomena, blending traditional UAP studies with broader investigations into exotic propulsion, advanced weapon systems, and unexplained paranormal activity.

### **Origins and Purpose**

1. **Initiation:**
    
    - AAWSAP was initiated under the direction of the Defense Intelligence Agency, with strong advocacy from Senator **Harry Reid**, who recognized the strategic importance of UAP-related research.
    - Its establishment followed numerous UAP encounters reported by military personnel and pilots, highlighting a need for formal investigation.
2. **Goals:**
    
    - To assess potential threats posed by UAPs or advanced aerospace technologies from adversaries or unknown sources.
    - To explore cutting-edge propulsion systems, aerospace materials, and weapons capabilities.
    - To examine the broader implications of UAP phenomena, including physical and psychological effects on witnesses.
3. **Contracting Partner:**
    
    - The primary contractor for AAWSAP was **Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS)**, founded by entrepreneur Robert Bigelow, a long-time proponent of UAP research.

### **Scope and Activities**

1. **Investigative Focus:**
    
    - Unlike its successor program, AATIP, AAWSAP encompassed a wide array of phenomena, including UAPs, advanced propulsion, and anomalous events such as those at **Skinwalker Ranch**.
    - It sought to identify disruptive aerospace technologies and their origins, whether terrestrial or otherwise.
2. **Skinwalker Ranch:**
    
    - A central focus of AAWSAP involved research at **Skinwalker Ranch**, a property in Utah known for its history of paranormal phenomena.
    - Researchers investigated reports of UAPs, cattle mutilations, electromagnetic disturbances, and other anomalies.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
    
    - Witness testimonies, video and radar evidence, and physical materials were analyzed for signs of advanced technology.
    - The program also studied physiological and psychological effects reported by witnesses of UAP encounters, exploring potential health implications and sensory phenomena.

### **Funding and Budget**

1. **Financial Support:**
    
    - A $22 million budget was allocated for AAWSAP under the DIA’s classified black budget, covering research, field investigations, and contractor costs.
    - A significant portion of the funding was directed to BAASS for on-site investigations, material analyses, and data collection.
2. **Reports and Deliverables:**
    
    - AAWSAP produced detailed reports on UAP capabilities, theoretical propulsion mechanisms, and potential national security risks.
    - Some findings were shared with key government officials, while others remain classified.

### **Findings and Discoveries**

1. **UAP Capabilities:**
    
    - AAWSAP documented UAPs demonstrating:
        - Hypersonic speeds.
        - Instantaneous acceleration.
        - Transmedium travel (air to water, or space to air).
        - Advanced cloaking or stealth capabilities.
2. **Health Effects:**
    
    - Witnesses of UAP encounters reported unusual physical symptoms, including radiation burns, nausea, and neurological effects, suggesting interactions with advanced energy systems.
3. **Material Studies:**
    
    - Exotic materials allegedly recovered from UAP incidents were analyzed for composition and potential applications, though many details remain undisclosed.

### **Controversy and Legacy**

1. **Criticism:**
    
    - Skeptics questioned the program’s focus on paranormal activity, suggesting it diluted the credibility of UAP research.
    - Others criticized the lack of transparency and public access to findings.
2. **Transition to AATIP:**
    
    - Around 2012, AAWSAP transitioned into a narrower program, the **Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)**, under the leadership of Luis Elizondo.
    - AATIP focused exclusively on UAPs with direct national security implications.
3. **Influence:**
    
    - AAWSAP laid the groundwork for ongoing UAP investigations, contributing to the eventual formation of the **UAP Task Force** and the **All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)**.

### **Significance**

AAWSAP marked a bold effort to address the mysteries of UAPs and anomalous phenomena with scientific rigor and government resources. Its holistic approach, encompassing both physical and metaphysical aspects of the phenomena, reflected the complexity of the issues at hand. Although much of its work remains classified, AAWSAP was instrumental in legitimizing UAP research and opening doors for future government and public investigations.
