# Vimanas

The concept of **vimanas**—ancient flying vehicles described in Indian scriptures—has intrigued scholars, historians, and enthusiasts of ancient technology for centuries. These accounts, found primarily in Hindu epics and texts such as the **Mahabharata**, **Ramayana**, and **Vaimanika Shastra**, describe advanced aerial vehicles with capabilities far beyond what would be expected from ancient, or even modern, civilizations.
