# The Japan Airlines 1628 UFO Encounter (1986)

**Summary:**  
The Japan Airlines 1628 UFO Encounter is one of the most documented and credible UFO sightings, involving an experienced airline crew and corroborated by radar data. On November 17, 1986, Captain Kenju Terauchi, a veteran pilot with over 10,000 flight hours, and his crew reported a massive unidentified craft shadowing their Boeing 747 cargo plane over Alaska, along with two smaller craft. The larger craft was described as larger than an aircraft carrier and emitted bright, pulsating lights. The craft followed him for 40 minutes, staying with him even after significant evasive maneuvers. Despite being tracked by FAA and military radar, the incident was dismissed by authorities, sparking controversy and enduring intrigue.

**Why It Matters:**  
This case stands out for its combination of eyewitness testimony, radar confirmation, and a highly credible primary witness in Captain Terauchi. The incident is often cited as a textbook example of official obfuscation, raising questions about government transparency regarding UFO encounters.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Initial Sighting**

On November 17, 1986, Japan Airlines Flight 1628, a cargo flight en route from Paris to Tokyo with a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, was cruising at 35,000 feet. Around 5:11 PM, Captain Kenju Terauchi and his crew noticed two bright, unidentified lights approaching their aircraft near Fort Yukon and Fairbanks.

The lights were described as pulsating and moving erratically, with bursts of light occasionally illuminating the cockpit. Captain Terauchi initially assumed they were military aircraft conducting maneuvers but quickly realized they behaved unlike any known aircraft.

#### **The Massive Craft Appears**

As the smaller lights disappeared, a massive, dark object emerged. Terauchi described it as resembling a "mothership" and estimated its size to be larger than an aircraft carrier. The object maintained a position in the vicinity of the 747 for over 30 minutes, sometimes performing rapid maneuvers.

The crew observed structural details, including rows of lights and a metallic surface. The object appeared to emit heat, which Terauchi described as being so intense that it could be felt through the aircraft.

#### **Radar Confirmation**

During the encounter, the Anchorage Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar and a nearby military installation detected an unidentified object near JAL 1628. Despite the visual and radar evidence, ATC could not establish radio contact with the object. The radar returns confirmed an unknown craft trailing the Boeing 747, further lending credibility to the crew's account.

#### **Departure and Aftermath**

As the aircraft neared Anchorage, the UFO suddenly accelerated and disappeared. The crew landed safely, but Captain Terauchi reported the incident to the FAA, providing detailed sketches and testimony. Despite initial interest, authorities quickly downplayed the event.

### **Physical Evidence**

1. **Radar Confirmation:**
    
    - Anchorage ATC and military radar both detected an unidentified object near the aircraft.
    - The object's radar signature indicated a craft of considerable size.
2. **Witness Descriptions:**
    
    - The craft was described as a massive, structured object with rows of lights.
    - Smaller, pulsating lights behaved erratically before the larger object appeared.
3. **Pilot’s Testimony:**
    
    - Captain Terauchi, a seasoned pilot, provided detailed descriptions and sketches of the encounter.

### **Investigations**

#### **FAA Response**

The FAA initially acknowledged the radar data and witness reports but later dismissed the incident, attributing it to a combination of radar anomalies and misinterpretations by the crew.

#### **Media and Public Reaction**

The incident gained widespread attention after it was leaked to the press. Terauchi faced intense scrutiny and ridicule, leading to his temporary grounding as a pilot. The case remains a focal point for UFO researchers due to its compelling mix of evidence.
