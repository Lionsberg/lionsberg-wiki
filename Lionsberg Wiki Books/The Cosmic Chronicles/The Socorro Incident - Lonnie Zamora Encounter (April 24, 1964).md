# The Socorro Incident - Lonnie Zamora Encounter (April 24, 1964)

**Summary:**  
The Socorro Incident is one of the most well-documented UFO encounters, involving a credible witness, physical evidence, and a detailed investigative response. On April 24, 1964, Police Officer Lonnie Zamora observed an oval-shaped craft and two small humanoid figures in the desert near Socorro, New Mexico. The event left ground markings, scorched vegetation, and remains classified as an “unknown” in the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book files.

**Why It Matters:** 

The Socorro Incident marked a milestone in UFO investigations due to its compelling physical evidence and the unimpeachable credibility of Officer Lonnie Zamora. Occurring amidst growing public interest in UFO phenomena, the event galvanized researchers within and beyond Project Blue Book to grapple with the reality of unexplained aerial phenomena. It remains a cornerstone case, pointing toward patterns of interaction between unknown entities and humanity.

**Narrative Overview:**  
Late in the afternoon, on the outskirts of Socorro, New Mexico, Police Officer Lonnie Zamora was in the midst of pursuing a speeding motorist along a quiet stretch of road. Suddenly, a loud roar, unlike any engine he had ever heard, drew his attention away from the chase. Simultaneously, a bright flash of flame or light flared against the desert landscape. Concerned that he might be dealing with an explosion or an accident—perhaps a dynamite shack or a wayward aircraft—Zamora broke off the pursuit and headed toward the source of the disturbance.

Cresting a small rise in the hilly terrain, he encountered a sight that would leave him shaken: a smooth, oval-shaped craft, roughly the size of a compact car, resting on what appeared to be landing legs. Its surface gleamed in the late afternoon sun, and a strange red, inverted “V” symbol stood out clearly on its side. Near the object, he glimpsed two small figures clad in white coveralls, seemingly startled by his sudden arrival. The desert was otherwise silent and empty—no signs of wires, vehicles, or structures that might suggest a staged scenario.

As Zamora moved closer, the craft emitted a second roar and a burst of blueish flame from beneath it. The figures vanished, either inside the craft or out of his line of sight. In the span of just a few moments, the object lifted straight into the air, executing a vertical takeoff with an effortless grace no helicopter or known aircraft could match, then angled away and sped off at astonishing speed. The entire encounter lasted only minutes, but it etched itself into Zamora’s memory as something entirely outside his prior experience.

Within minutes of the craft’s departure, Zamora radioed for backup. When fellow officers arrived, they found him visibly unsettled but unwavering in his account. Following his indications, they inspected the landing area closely. The ground bore four neat depressions where the object’s support structures had pressed into the soil. Brush near the site was scorched and singed, consistent with exposure to intense heat. No footprints, tire tracks, or mechanical contrivances suggested a hoax. Investigators, including those from the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book, scrutinized the evidence and interviewed Zamora—an officer of good standing known for his reliability. None could find a mundane explanation that fit the combination of a credible witness, unusual aerial maneuvers, distinctive markings, and lasting physical traces.

As days turned into weeks, the Socorro incident would stand as one of the most perplexing cases in the official files. Neither conventional aircraft nor common misidentifications accounted for the details. Instead, the event would be classified among the Air Force’s most baffling “unknowns,” frequently cited by researchers as a benchmark example of a well-documented, physically grounded UFO encounter.

**Key Observations:**

- **Object Description:** Oval or egg-shaped craft, approximately car-sized, bearing a red inverted “V” symbol.
- **Occupants:** Two small figures in white coveralls, briefly observed near the object before departure.
- **Maneuvers:** Vertical lift-off and high-speed departure without visible propulsion systems.

**Physical Evidence:**

- **Ground Marks:** Four symmetrical depressions in the soil, suggestive of landing gear.
- **Vegetation Damage:** Scorched brush and singed foliage consistent with exposure to intense heat.
- **Lack of Hoax Indicators:** No footprints, wires, or artificial supports discovered.

**Investigations:**

- **Immediate Response:** Other officers confirmed Zamora’s agitation and authenticity.
- **Air Force Involvement:** Project Blue Book and FBI personnel examined the case without finding a prosaic solution.
- **Witness Credibility:** Zamora’s established integrity lent significant weight to his testimony.

**Outcome and Significance:**

- **Categorization as “Unknown”:** The Socorro event resisted all conventional explanations.
- **Enduring Importance:** It remains a cornerstone case emphasizing that certain reports, supported by reliable witnesses and tangible traces, defy ordinary interpretation—shaping the discourse on UFO investigations for decades to come.
