# The Bothell UFO Burn Circles (1994)

**Summary:**  
The Bothell UFO Burn Circles case involves a series of mysterious scorched patterns discovered on a rural property near Bothell, Washington. In the summer of 1994, multiple witnesses reported seeing bright, unidentified lights over the area. The following day, unusual circular burn marks were found on the ground, alongside reports of strange sounds and electromagnetic disturbances. The case remains unexplained and is frequently cited as a compelling example of physical trace evidence associated with UFO activity.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Bothell UFO Burn Circles case is notable for its physical evidence, including well-documented burn marks and corroborating eyewitness accounts. The combination of environmental changes and electromagnetic anomalies adds to its credibility and makes it a significant case in UFO research.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Events Unfold**

In July 1994, residents near Bothell, Washington, reported seeing bright, glowing orbs of light hovering over a rural property. The lights appeared to move erratically, shifting colors from white to orange to blue. Several witnesses described the objects as silent and capable of instantaneous acceleration.

One witness, a local farmer, reported hearing a strange humming sound during the sighting. His livestock displayed unusual behavior, appearing agitated and clustering near the center of the field as the lights passed overhead. The event lasted approximately 20 minutes before the objects shot upward and disappeared.

The next morning, the farmer discovered several perfectly circular burn marks scorched into the ground. The circles, measuring roughly 10–12 feet in diameter, had sharp, well-defined edges. The grass within the circles was dehydrated and brittle, as though subjected to intense heat. Soil samples revealed no chemical contamination but showed signs of exposure to high temperatures.

#### **Physical Evidence**

1. **Burn Circles:**
    
    - Multiple circular burn marks were found, each about 10–12 feet in diameter.
    - The edges were sharply defined, with dehydrated, scorched grass inside the circles.
2. **Soil Analysis:**
    
    - Samples revealed changes in soil composition consistent with exposure to high heat.
    - No chemical residues or signs of conventional fire sources were detected.
3. **Electromagnetic Disturbances:**
    
    - Witnesses reported electrical malfunctions, including flickering lights and dead batteries, in the vicinity.
    - Compasses and other instruments displayed erratic behavior when brought near the burn sites.
4. **Livestock Behavior:**
    
    - Animals appeared distressed during and after the sighting, clustering unusually close together for hours after the event.

### **Investigations**

#### **Local Authorities**

- Local police documented the sighting and the burn circles but could not provide an explanation.
- The case was referred to regional UFO research organizations for further study.

#### **Scientific Analysis**

- Soil samples were sent to a university lab for analysis.
- Findings confirmed exposure to high heat but ruled out conventional sources such as lightning or man-made fires.

#### **Witness Credibility**

The primary witness, a long-time farmer with no prior interest in UFO phenomena, was described as credible and cooperative. His detailed account aligned with reports from other local residents.
