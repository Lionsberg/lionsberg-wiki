# The Skinwalker Ranch Investigations (1996–Present)

### **Introduction**

The investigations into **Skinwalker Ranch**, located in Utah’s Uintah Basin, span several decades and are renowned for their exploration of unexplained phenomena. The ranch, nicknamed “the most scientifically studied paranormal hotspot on the planet,” has been the focus of private research, government-funded programs, and popular media. Reports from the ranch include encounters with UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), cryptid-like creatures, poltergeist activity, and electromagnetic anomalies.

This entry examines the history of investigations at Skinwalker Ranch, including its connection to programs such as **AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program)** and the subsequent scientific studies and media coverage.

### **Historical Overview**

#### **Native American Lore**

- The Uintah Basin has long been associated with legends of shape-shifting entities known as **Skinwalkers**, particularly within Navajo culture.
- Native American accounts describe malevolent beings inhabiting the area, capable of manipulating reality and instilling fear.

#### **Robert Bigelow’s Ownership (1996–2016)**

- In 1996, real estate mogul and paranormal enthusiast **Robert Bigelow** purchased the ranch for $200,000.
- Bigelow funded the **National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)** to investigate the phenomena scientifically.
- NIDS research included:
    - Deployment of high-tech surveillance equipment.
    - Collection of anecdotal and physical evidence.
    - Attempts to document recurring anomalies such as UAPs, glowing orbs, and electromagnetic disturbances.
- Results were inconclusive, with researchers often experiencing phenomena without capturing definitive evidence.

### **Connection to AAWSAP (2008–2012)**

- Skinwalker Ranch became a focal point for the **Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)**, a Pentagon-funded program initiated in 2008.
- The program, overseen by **Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS)**, investigated UAPs and other anomalous phenomena.
- Key research findings at Skinwalker Ranch included:
    - Correlations between UAP sightings and environmental disturbances.
    - Documented cases of acute physiological and psychological effects on witnesses.
    - Theorization that the phenomena might involve advanced technologies or multidimensional entities.
- The AAWSAP report suggested a link between UAPs and broader paranormal phenomena, though these claims remain speculative.
