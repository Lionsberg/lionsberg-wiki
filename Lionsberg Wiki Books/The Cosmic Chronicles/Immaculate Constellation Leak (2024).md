# Immaculate Constellation Leak (2024)

In October 2024, independent journalist **Michael Shellenberger** reported on a whistleblower's claims regarding a clandestine Department of Defense (DoD) program named **"Immaculate Constellation."** This program is purported to focus on the collection and analysis of data related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), operating without Congressional oversight.

## Whistleblower Allegations

The whistleblower's report, spanning 11 pages, was submitted to Congress on November 13, 2024. It alleges that "Immaculate Constellation" was established in 2017, following the _New York Times_ article that unveiled the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The report claims that this Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) has been managing UAP and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) issues without Congressional knowledge or authorization, potentially for decades.

The document details various UAP sightings collected by technical assets and U.S. military personnel, emphasizing the use of advanced sensor technologies to capture UAP characteristics not observable with the human eye alone. It asserts that the program serves as a central entity consolidating observations of UAPs from multiple collection platforms.

## Congressional Hearing and Testimony

During a House Oversight Committee hearing on November 13, 2024, Representative **Nancy Mace** entered the whistleblower's report into the Congressional record. Michael Shellenberger testified about the alleged program, highlighting the extensive data on UAPs purportedly held by the U.S. military and intelligence community.

The hearing also addressed controversies regarding the report's submission process, including discrepancies about its origin and the involvement of UFO researcher **Jeremy Corbell**. Corbell reportedly provided a cover letter accompanying the report, leading to questions about the document's provenance and the dynamics among those presenting the information to Congress.

Additionally, former officials, including **Sean Kirkpatrick**, former director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), have dismissed the existence of such a program, affirming that all relevant programs have been duly reported to Congress.

## Conclusion

The allegations surrounding "Immaculate Constellation" have intensified discussions about government transparency and the existence of secret UAP programs. While the whistleblower's claims have brought attention to potential clandestine activities, official denials and the absence of corroborating evidence leave the matter unresolved. The situation underscores the ongoing tension between efforts to uncover the truth about UAPs and the challenges posed by secrecy and skepticism.
