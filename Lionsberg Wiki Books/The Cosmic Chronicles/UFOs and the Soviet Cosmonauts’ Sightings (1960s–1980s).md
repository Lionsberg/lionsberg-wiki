# UFOs and the Soviet Cosmonauts’ Sightings (1960s–1980s)

**Summary:**  
During the height of the Cold War and the Soviet space program’s golden age, cosmonauts frequently reported encounters with unidentified flying objects and unexplained phenomena in space. These accounts, often corroborated by mission data and other crew members, describe advanced maneuvers, glowing orbs, and even humanoid apparitions. While these sightings remain shrouded in secrecy due to the Soviet Union's strict controls, declassified reports and firsthand testimonies provide compelling evidence of UFO activity observed by some of humanity's most trained and credible witnesses.

**Why It Matters:**  
The sightings by Soviet cosmonauts, individuals with rigorous training and scientific expertise, add significant weight to the UFO phenomenon. These encounters occurred in space—an environment where natural misidentifications are minimized—highlighting the global nature of UFO activity and its potential implications for humanity.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Yuri Gagarin (1961): The First Sightings**

As the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin reportedly observed mysterious glowing objects during his historic flight aboard _Vostok 1_. Though details remain scarce, unofficial accounts suggest Gagarin privately spoke of “lights following” his spacecraft. Later interviews hint that Gagarin believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

#### **Salyut 6 and 7 Orbital Stations (1970s–1980s): Orbs and Apparitions**

Cosmonauts aboard the _Salyut 6_ and _Salyut 7_ space stations frequently reported luminous objects approaching their craft. In one notable incident in 1984, crew members on _Salyut 7_ witnessed glowing entities resembling humanoid figures outside their station. These “angels,” described as having wings and radiant auras, hovered near the station for several minutes before disappearing.

#### **Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1975): Joint Sightings**

During the historic U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission, both American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts reported unidentified objects in proximity to their spacecraft. Though dismissed officially, mission transcripts and crew interviews suggest mutual acknowledgment of unexplained phenomena.

#### **Georgi Grechko (1980s): Unusual Light Patterns**

Veteran cosmonaut Georgi Grechko, who flew on multiple missions, described witnessing fast-moving, brightly lit objects during his time aboard _Salyut 6_. He later stated in interviews that these sightings defied any known explanations and appeared to display intelligent control.

#### **Declassified KGB Reports: UFOs Over Baikonur**

Documents from Soviet archives detail sightings near the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the USSR’s premier space launch facility. Multiple launch crews reported glowing orbs hovering near rockets and satellites, with some accounts suggesting interference with equipment.
