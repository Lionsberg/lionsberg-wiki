# The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction (1961)

**Summary:**  
The Betty and Barney Hill Abduction is the first widely publicized case of an alien abduction in the United States and remains one of the most compelling and controversial UFO encounters in history. On the night of September 19, 1961, the Hills were traveling through rural New Hampshire when they observed a strange light in the sky that seemed to follow their car. The light eventually revealed itself as a craft, leading to a period of missing time and fragmented memories. Under hypnosis, the Hills recounted being taken aboard the craft, examined by humanoid beings, and shown a "star map" indicating the visitors' origins. This case introduced many of the now-familiar elements of alien abduction lore.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On the night of September 19, 1961, Betty and Barney Hill were returning home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after a vacation in Canada. Near Lancaster, they noticed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be following their car. As they continued driving, the object descended closer, revealing itself as a structured craft with rows of windows. Barney stopped the car to observe the object through binoculars and claimed to see humanoid figures inside, seemingly operating the craft.

Feeling a sense of dread, the Hills fled the area, but as they drove, a strange buzzing sound surrounded their car. Their memories became fragmented, and the next thing they recalled was arriving home two hours later than expected, with no explanation for the lost time.

#### **The Hypnosis Sessions**

In the months following the encounter, the Hills experienced persistent anxiety and strange physical symptoms. Betty began having vivid dreams of being taken aboard a spacecraft, where humanoid beings examined her and showed her a star map. Seeking answers, the Hills consulted Dr. Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist specializing in hypnosis.

Under separate hypnosis sessions, Betty and Barney described being taken aboard the craft, examined by beings with large heads and almond-shaped eyes, and subjected to medical procedures. Betty recalled an entity showing her a map of star systems, which she later reproduced from memory. Astronomer Marjorie Fish later analyzed the map, concluding it closely resembled the Zeta Reticuli star system.
