### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Encounters in the Appalachian Mountains**

In the Appalachian region, hikers and spelunkers have reported seeing reptilian figures near cave entrances. In 2018, a group of campers in Kentucky’s Daniel Boone National Forest encountered a humanoid figure with glowing red eyes. Witnesses claimed the figure emitted a guttural growl before retreating into a cave. Later investigations revealed claw-like marks on nearby trees and unusual electromagnetic interference in the area.

#### **The Dulce Base Connection**

In New Mexico, the area around Archuleta Mesa near Dulce has been the site of numerous reptilian encounters tied to alleged underground bases. Researchers and whistleblowers, including former military personnel, claim that reptilian beings are part of secretive government experiments or collaborations. Reports from the 1970s to the present day describe humanoids emerging from hidden entrances near the mesa, often in conjunction with UFO sightings.

#### **Pacific Northwest Sightings**

In the forests of Washington State, loggers and outdoor enthusiasts have described encounters with reptilian creatures. One notable event in 1996 involved a forest ranger who claimed to see a reptilian figure observing him from a ridge. The figure disappeared into the forest, leaving behind tracks with three clawed toes.

#### **Florida’s Everglades**

The Everglades have long been a hotspot for cryptid sightings, including reports of reptilian humanoids. In 2004, a fisherman reported seeing a scaly humanoid creature standing near the water’s edge before diving into the swamp. Subsequent searches of the area revealed no trace of the creature but noted unusual thermal readings in the water.
