### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

Shortly after 1:00 AM on August 27, 1979, Deputy Val Johnson was patrolling near State Highway 220 in Marshall County, Minnesota. While driving, he noticed a bright light in the distance. Initially assuming it might be an aircraft or a truck, he continued toward it to investigate.

As he approached, the light rapidly intensified and moved toward his vehicle. Johnson described the light as small, round, and incredibly bright, illuminating the interior of his car before he heard a loud bang and lost consciousness.

#### **The Aftermath**

When Johnson regained consciousness approximately 39 minutes later, he found his patrol car damaged. The windshield was cracked, the hood dented, and one headlight shattered. The radio antenna was bent at a sharp angle, and a wristwatch and the car’s clock had stopped for 14 minutes, as if frozen in time.

Johnson himself experienced minor injuries, including welts on his face and temporary eye pain, likened to welder’s burns, consistent with intense light exposure.
