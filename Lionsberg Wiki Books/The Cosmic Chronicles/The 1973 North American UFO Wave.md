### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Early Sightings: Summer 1973**

The wave began with sporadic sightings in the southern United States during the summer months. Witnesses reported glowing orbs and large, silent triangular craft performing maneuvers that defied conventional aviation capabilities. Reports from rural areas often included encounters with strange lights hovering over fields and roads.

#### **Peak Activity: Fall 1973**

By October, the wave reached its peak, with hundreds of reports flooding into local authorities, UFO organizations, and news outlets. Notable cases include:

- **The Pascagoula Abduction (October 11):**  
    In Pascagoula, Mississippi, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed to have been abducted by robotic, humanoid beings while fishing on the Pascagoula River. The case gained international attention due to the witnesses’ credibility and consistent accounts under hypnosis.
    
- **The Coyne Helicopter Incident (October 18):**  
    Near Mansfield, Ohio, an Army Reserve helicopter crew encountered a cigar-shaped UFO that descended rapidly toward their aircraft, stopping just short of a collision. The object emitted a green beam of light that appeared to interfere with the helicopter’s controls before accelerating away at an incredible speed. Radar confirmed the presence of an unidentified object.
    
- **The Kentucky Farm Encounter (October 1973):**  
    A family in Kentucky reported a UFO landing near their property, accompanied by humanoid figures inspecting the area. Their dogs and livestock reportedly reacted with panic.
    

#### **Later Sightings: Winter 1973**

As the year progressed, sightings continued into the winter, though their frequency decreased. Many involved triangular craft with multicolored lights, often witnessed near military installations or in rural areas.
