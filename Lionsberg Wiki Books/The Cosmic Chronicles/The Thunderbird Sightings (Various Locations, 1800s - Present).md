# The Thunderbird Sightings (Various Locations, 1800s - Present)

**Summary:**  
The Thunderbird, a colossal, bird-like cryptid rooted in Native American mythology, has reportedly been sighted across North America from the 1800s to the present. Witnesses describe a massive flying creature with wingspans ranging from 15 to 30 feet, resembling a prehistoric pterosaur or an eagle-like bird. These sightings often coincide with thunderstorms, reinforcing the Thunderbird's association with weather phenomena in Indigenous legends. Accounts of the Thunderbird span centuries, blending folklore, eyewitness reports, and enduring mystery.

**Why It Matters:**  
Thunderbird sightings challenge conventional zoology by suggesting the existence of an undiscovered species or a surviving relic of prehistoric life. With consistent descriptions from diverse sources over centuries, the Thunderbird occupies a unique place at the intersection of cultural heritage, cryptozoology, and the unexplained.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **Historical Roots**

The Thunderbird is deeply ingrained in Native American culture, often depicted as a powerful, supernatural being capable of summoning storms. Tribes such as the Lakota, Ojibwe, and Algonquin regard the Thunderbird as a protector and a bringer of rain. These stories describe a creature so large and formidable that its wings create thunder and its eyes shoot lightning.

#### **Early Reports**

In the late 1800s, settlers began reporting sightings of massive flying creatures, often likened to the "dragons" of European folklore. One of the most famous early accounts came in 1890, when two cowboys in Arizona allegedly killed a large, bird-like creature resembling a pterosaur. Their account, though widely circulated, lacked physical evidence, sparking debates about its veracity.

#### **Modern Sightings**

Thunderbird reports persisted into the 20th and 21st centuries, with notable sightings in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Alaska, and Texas. Witnesses consistently described immense wingspans, leathery or feathered wings, and a terrifying presence. In 1977, residents of Lawndale, Illinois, reported a Thunderbird attempting to lift a young boy, though he escaped unharmed. In Alaska, bush pilots frequently recount encounters with enormous flying creatures, often suggesting a prehistoric origin.
