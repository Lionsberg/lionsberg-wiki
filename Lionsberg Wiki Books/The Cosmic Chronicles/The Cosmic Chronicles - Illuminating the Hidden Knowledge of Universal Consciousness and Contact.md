# The Cosmic Chronicles - Illuminating the Hidden Knowledge of Universal Consciousness and Contact

After reading [[Jordan's Final Report]], We began using AI to rapidly research and document [[Evidence]] of his claims. 

Here We are curating and documenting some of the top evidence and events relating to extraterrestrial and interdimensional consciousness and contact. 

Chapter [[22. Aliens and Fascists In the 21st Century]] in [[Aliens, Fascists, and Giants  - Our Epic Battle for The Future of Civilization]] cross references and goes beyond. 

Of the countless thousands of credible and verified topics and events, these 200+ people, stories, and events provide a starting point for getting up to the speed on the Reality that [[We Are Not Alone in the Universe]]. 

This is a [[Work In Progress]]. We are perhaps 150 cases in, and will be adding as Time, Energy, and Resources allow.
