# The Cosmic Chronicles - Illuminating the Hidden Knowledge of Universal Consciousness and Contact

Here We are attempting to collect and progressively document some of the top evidence and events relating to extraterrestrial and interdimensional consciousness and contact. 

Chapter [[22. Aliens and Fascists In the 21st Century]] in [[Aliens, Fascists, and Giants  - Our Epic Battle for The Future of Civilization]] cross references and goes beyond.
