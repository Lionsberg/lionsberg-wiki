### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Event**

On the evening of September 12, 1952, brothers Ed and Fred May, along with their friend Tommy Hyer, witnessed a bright, glowing object streak across the sky before crashing into a hillside near their home. Alarmed, they ran to inform their mother, Kathleen May, who gathered a group, including West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, to investigate.

Armed with flashlights, the group climbed the hill, finding an area shrouded in a strange, pungent mist. Their flashlights illuminated a creature that defied explanation: a towering, humanoid figure with glowing red eyes, claw-like hands, and a spade-shaped, hood-like head. The creature appeared to levitate or hover slightly above the ground.

As they approached, the entity emitted a hissing sound and glided toward them. Overcome with fear, the group fled the scene, with Lemon dropping his flashlight in panic. Upon returning to town, they reported the incident to local authorities, sparking media attention and investigations.

The witnesses reported immediate symptoms, including:

- **Irritation and Sickness:** Burning eyes, nausea, and throat irritation, possibly from the mist.
