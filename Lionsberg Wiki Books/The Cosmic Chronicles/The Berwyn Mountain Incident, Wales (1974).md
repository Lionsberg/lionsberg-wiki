# The Berwyn Mountain Incident, Wales (1974)

**Summary:**  
On the evening of January 23, 1974, residents near the Berwyn Mountains in Wales experienced what many believe to be a UFO crash. The incident involved reports of a loud explosion, tremors, and strange lights seen on the mountainside. While authorities attributed the events to a meteorite or an earthquake coupled with poachers’ activities, UFO researchers have pointed to discrepancies in official explanations, eyewitness accounts of strange craft, and subsequent military activity in the area. Often referred to as "the Welsh Roswell," the Berwyn Mountain Incident remains one of the UK’s most intriguing UFO mysteries.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Berwyn Mountain Incident is notable for its combination of physical effects, such as seismic activity, unexplained lights, and credible witness testimonies. The alleged military involvement and lack of conclusive explanations have fueled speculation about extraterrestrial visitation and government cover-ups in the UK.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Incident**

Around 8:30 PM on January 23, residents in the village of Llandrillo and surrounding areas reported a loud explosion that shook their homes, followed by reports of bright lights on the Berwyn Mountains. The tremor registered 3.5 on the Richter scale, leading some to believe an aircraft had crashed.

One witness, nurse Pat Evans, drove to the site with her daughters to provide assistance, assuming it was a downed aircraft. Upon arrival, she described seeing a large glowing object on the mountainside. The light emitted a pulsating orange and red glow and was unlike anything she had ever seen. However, she found no wreckage, survivors, or signs of an aircraft crash.

#### **Military Presence and Suppression**

Shortly after the event, witnesses reported an unusual military presence in the area. Convoys of unmarked vehicles and personnel were observed heading toward the mountains, and access to certain locations was restricted. The sudden appearance of military activity led to speculation that the object seen on the mountainside was retrieved and its nature concealed.

Locals also reported being discouraged from speaking to the press, adding to suspicions of a cover-up. Some accounts suggest helicopters were seen in the area after the initial event, further fueling theories of a UFO retrieval operation.

#### **Official Explanations and Controversy**

The UK government and geological experts attributed the incident to a combination of natural phenomena. According to official reports, the explosion and tremor were caused by an earthquake, while the lights were attributed to a meteor entering the Earth’s atmosphere. Additional speculation about poachers using powerful lamps to track game added an element of mundane explanation.

However, researchers have pointed out inconsistencies in the official narrative. Eyewitnesses insist the lights were far too bright and structured to be poaching lamps or meteors. Moreover, the sudden and unexplained military response remains unexplained in official accounts.
