### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On a cold winter afternoon, Esko Viljo and Reino Viirto were skiing through a forest near Imjärvi, a small village in Finland. As they paused to rest, they noticed a bright light approaching from above. Moments later, a dome-shaped craft, about 10 feet in diameter, descended and hovered a few meters above the snow.

The craft emitted a peculiar hum and was surrounded by a glowing, fog-like aura. Suddenly, a bright, conical beam of light shot out from its underside, striking the ground near the men. The light appeared to "swirl" and pulsate, creating an eerie atmosphere.

Both men reported feeling an intense, localized heat and a sense of paralysis when the beam touched them. Reino Viirto collapsed, while Esko Viljo struggled to stay on his feet. After a few moments, the craft ascended silently and disappeared into the sky.
