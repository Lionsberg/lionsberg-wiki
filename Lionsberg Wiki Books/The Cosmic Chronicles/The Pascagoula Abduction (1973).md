# The Pascagoula Abduction (1973)

**Summary:**  
The Pascagoula Abduction is one of the most chilling and well-documented alien abduction cases on record. On the night of October 11, 1973, two men, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker, were fishing along the Pascagoula River in Mississippi when they were allegedly abducted by strange beings and taken aboard a craft. The beings were described as humanoid but robotic in appearance, with claw-like hands and wrinkled, gray skin. Despite their terror, both men reported being subjected to medical examinations before being returned to the riverbank. The case gained national attention due to the men’s consistent and emotionally charged accounts, corroborated by a secretly recorded conversation at the police station.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Encounter**

On October 11, 1973, Charles Hickson (42) and Calvin Parker (19) were fishing at a quiet spot along the Pascagoula River when they noticed a strange craft descending nearby. The object emitted a blue light and appeared to hover just above the ground. As they watched in disbelief, a hatch opened, and three beings emerged, floating toward them.

The beings were described as humanoid but distinctly non-human. They were roughly five feet tall, with wrinkled, grayish skin, conical heads, and no discernible eyes. Their arms ended in claw-like appendages, and their movements were mechanical, as if robotic.

#### **The Abduction**

The men reported being paralyzed and lifted into the craft by the beings. Once aboard, Hickson described being placed on a table and subjected to a thorough examination by a device resembling a mechanical eye that moved over his body. Parker, who was severely traumatized by the event, recalled less about the experience but later provided corroborating details under hypnosis.

After the examination, the men were returned to the riverbank, where they found themselves unharmed but emotionally shaken. The craft then ascended and disappeared into the night sky.

#### **Immediate Aftermath**

Hickson and Parker immediately went to the local sheriff’s office to report the incident. While initially skeptical, the sheriff secretly recorded their private conversation, capturing their raw fear and disbelief. This recording became a critical piece of evidence, as it demonstrated that the men were genuinely distressed and not fabricating their story.
