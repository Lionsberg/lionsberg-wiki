# The Aurora UFO Crash, Texas (1897)

**Summary:**  
The Aurora UFO Crash is one of the earliest recorded incidents of a possible extraterrestrial encounter, predating the famous Roswell crash by 50 years. On April 17, 1897, a mysterious airship was reported to have crashed into a windmill on a farm in Aurora, Texas. According to local newspaper accounts, the wreckage included strange metallic debris, and the body of the pilot—described as "not of this world"—was allegedly recovered and buried in a local cemetery. This event has since become a cornerstone of early UFO lore, sparking debates about extraterrestrial visitation and cover-ups long before the advent of modern aviation.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Incident**

In the early morning of April 17, 1897, residents of Aurora, Texas, observed a strange, cigar-shaped airship flying erratically through the sky. The craft, described as metallic and glowing, appeared to be in distress. Moments later, it reportedly crashed into a windmill on the property of Judge J.S. Proctor, causing a massive explosion that scattered debris across the farm.

Local witnesses rushed to the scene, where they discovered wreckage composed of lightweight, unidentifiable metal. Amid the debris was the body of a small humanoid figure, described as the craft's pilot. Eyewitnesses claimed the being was "not of this world."

#### **The Burial**

According to reports, townspeople recovered the remains of the pilot and held a small, respectful funeral. The alien body was allegedly buried in an unmarked grave in the local Aurora cemetery. A historical marker at the cemetery acknowledges the event, although the exact location of the grave remains contested.

#### **Media Coverage**

The incident was reported in the April 19, 1897, edition of _The Dallas Morning News,_ which described the crash, the unusual debris, and the extraterrestrial pilot. The article included accounts from local witnesses and highlighted the mysterious nature of the event. The story quickly gained attention but was dismissed by some as a hoax or exaggeration.
