### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Initial Sightings**

Around 1:30 AM on December 14, 1994, a 911 call came into the Trumbull County dispatch center. A local resident reported seeing an unidentified object with bright lights hovering low in the sky near Liberty Township. The dispatcher, believing it to be a prank or misidentification, logged the report but initially dismissed its importance.

Minutes later, additional calls flooded in from residents describing a similar phenomenon. Dispatchers alerted nearby police units to investigate. Officer Eugene "Gene" Platt of the Liberty Township Police Department was among the first to respond, reporting seeing a massive craft with bright, multicolored lights moving slowly and silently across the sky.

#### **The Chase Begins**

As the object moved westward, additional officers joined the pursuit. They described a craft that defied conventional explanations: it was enormous, emitted no sound, and hovered effortlessly while performing sharp maneuvers. The bright lights on the craft alternated between red, blue, green, and white, illuminating the surrounding area.

Officers from multiple jurisdictions tracked the object as it traveled through the region. Attempts to follow the craft proved difficult due to its erratic movements and the rural terrain.

#### **Dispatch Recordings**

Throughout the event, police radio communications captured the officers’ reactions and descriptions in real-time. The recordings provide a rare, unfiltered look at their confusion, awe, and concern. Dispatchers could hear the anxiety and astonishment in the officers' voices as they described the craft.

One officer reportedly exclaimed, “I don’t know what that thing is, but it’s not an airplane!” Another described the lights as “so bright you could read a newspaper by them.”

#### **The Object Disappears**

After nearly an hour of pursuit, the object reportedly gained altitude and vanished into the night sky. No radar data or flight logs from nearby airports could account for the craft, and no explanation was provided for its presence or nature.
