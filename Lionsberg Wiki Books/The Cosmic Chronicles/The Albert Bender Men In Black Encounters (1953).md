# The Albert Bender Men In Black Encounters (1953)

**Summary:**  
Albert Bender’s encounters with the Men in Black are among the first documented instances of this mysterious phenomenon. Bender, the founder of the International Flying Saucer Bureau (IFSB), claimed he was visited by three strange men dressed in black, who telepathically warned him to abandon his UFO research. This chilling interaction led to the sudden closure of his organization and left an indelible mark on UFO lore, solidifying the Men in Black as a sinister force linked to UFO secrecy.

**Why It Matters:**  
The Albert Bender case is a cornerstone of the Men in Black narrative, establishing many of the now-familiar characteristics of these enigmatic figures. It also raises questions about the nature of UFO suppression and the potential involvement of non-human entities in silencing researchers.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Rise of the IFSB**

In the early 1950s, Albert Bender, a UFO enthusiast in Bridgeport, Connecticut, founded the International Flying Saucer Bureau (IFSB). The organization quickly gained traction, attracting members from across the globe and publishing a quarterly magazine, _Space Review_. Bender’s work focused on uncovering the truth about UFOs, and by 1953, he claimed to have come close to solving the UFO mystery.

#### **The Encounter**

Shortly after these breakthroughs, Bender experienced a series of bizarre events. He reported intense headaches, a pervasive sense of dread, and visits from shadowy figures. The most significant event occurred in 1953 when three men dressed in black suits appeared in his home. According to Bender:

- The men communicated telepathically, warning him to stop his research.
- They conveyed a profound sense of fear and paralysis, leaving him unable to resist their commands.
- Bender described the men as having glowing eyes and an otherworldly aura.

#### **The Aftermath**

Terrified and deeply shaken, Bender disbanded the IFSB shortly after the encounter, citing unspecified threats. His final issue of _Space Review_ included a cryptic message:  
_“We advise those engaged in saucer work to please be very cautious.”_

For years, Bender remained silent about the specifics of his experience. When he finally spoke out in his 1962 book, _Flying Saucers and the Three Men_, he revealed that the Men in Black were not human but extraterrestrial beings sent to enforce secrecy.
