# The Shag Harbour Incident (1967)

**Summary:**  
The Shag Harbour Incident, often called “Canada’s Roswell,” is one of the most well-documented UFO cases in history. On the evening of October 4, 1967, multiple witnesses reported seeing a glowing, low-flying object crash into the waters of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. The event was confirmed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers and civilian witnesses. Despite an immediate search-and-rescue operation, no debris or occupants were recovered, but military divers later claimed to have observed an unidentified object underwater. The case remains officially classified as an “unsolved aerial sighting.”

**Why It Matters:**  
The Shag Harbour Incident is significant for the high level of corroboration from civilian, police, and military sources. It highlights the inability of conventional authorities to explain the event, suggesting it involved advanced, unidentified technology. The case is notable for its transparency, as it was openly acknowledged and investigated by Canadian authorities.

### **Narrative Overview**

#### **The Event**

On October 4, 1967, at approximately 11:20 p.m., residents of Shag Harbour observed a low-flying, glowing object moving silently across the sky. Witnesses described the object as roughly 60 feet long, with four yellow or orange lights blinking in sequence. It appeared to descend at an angle before crashing into the harbour.

Several witnesses reported hearing a loud “whooshing” sound as the object entered the water. A luminous foam or yellow residue was observed at the crash site, leading many to believe it was an aircraft accident.

#### **Initial Investigation**

The RCMP was immediately contacted, and officers quickly arrived at the scene. Believing the incident involved a downed aircraft, they initiated a search-and-rescue mission. Local fishermen joined the effort, but no wreckage or survivors were found.

#### **Military Involvement**

The Canadian military launched an official investigation, deploying naval divers to search the ocean floor. While no debris was publicly recovered, unverified accounts from military personnel suggest the divers may have located an object resting on the seabed, which moved before recovery could occur. This has led to speculation about advanced underwater capabilities or alien technology.

#### **Aftermath**

Despite extensive investigations, the Shag Harbour Incident remains unexplained. It has been documented in Canadian government files and continues to be one of the most credible UFO cases due to the involvement of official agencies and multiple independent witnesses.
