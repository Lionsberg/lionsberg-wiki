# The Lionsberg System of Values

## Introduction 

This book is a [[Work In Progress]]. As we discover universal [[Values]]: 

1. We are listing them here 
2. We are working on simple descriptions 
3. We are working towards a full Values [[Pattern Language]] 
4. We are working to translate Values into Principles and Practices that can guide our lives and society  

## Values Pattern Language

We are establishing a Values Pattern Language to interrelate the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], and link them to principles and behaviors to guide our co-creative endeavors. 

[[Template For Values Pattern Language]]  

## The Spirit and Way 

These enumerated values are reflective of a unified and coherent [[Central Animating Spirit]], whose nature is [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

This Spirit results in our attempt to embody a non-propositional [[Way of Being]], rooted in Love and guided by Truth.  

## The Universal Core Values 

Among the [[Deepest]] Values on the list are [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Beauty]]. 

From [[Love]], and from these additional Core Values, all other values can be derived. 

## The Universal Derivative Values
