# The Lionsberg System of Values

## Introduction 

This book is a [[Work In Progress]]. As we rediscover the universal [[Values]] that cause people, society, and nature to flourish in harmony and coherence: 

1. We are identifying them here
2. We are starting with simple descriptions 
3. We are progressing towards a full Values [[Pattern Language]] 
4. We are working to translate Values into Principles and Practices that can guide our lives, society and human operating system 

## Values Pattern Language

Our Aim is to continuously improve a Values Pattern Language to interrelate the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], and link them to principles and behaviors to guide our co-creative endeavors. 

[[Template For Values Pattern Language]]  

## The Highest Uniting Value / The Meta Value 

By definition, the ultimately ineffable [[Meta Value]] we point to with [[Word Tools]] such as [[God]] / [[Creator]] / [[One]] is what balances, orders and coheres the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]] within Itself; the [[Central Animating Spirit]] that creates, sustains, and orders the [[Universe]]. 

## The Spirit and The Way of the One

In nearly all spiritual, religious, and wisdom traditions, the [[One]] is described as the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of the Universe; the Source, Author and Perfecter of Life and Consciousness. 

Our relationship to the [[One]] Spirit that creates and sustains [[All]] interexistent Life and Consciousness  is one of eternal and universal [[Covenant Relationship]], which beckons [[All Creation]] towards [[Omniconsiderate]] [[Right Relationship]] rooted in [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

As our Highest Aim, we are invited to Progress [[Towards Oneness Through Love]], progressively enlightening and reuniting our Spirit with its Source by helping All Creation do the same. 

This leads to [[Way of Being]] that is ultimately [[Non-Propositional]] in nature, where we exist and move in and according to the [[Ultimately Ineffable]] Spirit of God, and not the written word. 

When we exist in this [[Way]], we discover that we naturally co-operate to fulfill not merely the letter, but the Spirit and Logos of the Universal Law. 

[[All]] Values can therefore best be understood in the context of the [[One]] they all share in common. They can best be understood as reflections or facets of the [[One]] Uniting [[Meta Value]] of Greatest Worth. 

## The Deepest Value
