# The Lionsberg System of Values

## Introduction 

This book is a [[Work In Progress]]. As we discover the universal [[Values]] that cause people, society, and nature to flourish: 

1. We are identifying them here
2. We are starting with simple descriptions 
3. We are progressing towards a full Values [[Pattern Language]] 
4. We are working to translate Values into Principles and Practices that can guide our lives, society and human operating system 

## Values Pattern Language

We are establishing a Values Pattern Language to interrelate the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]], and link them to principles and behaviors to guide our co-creative endeavors. 

[[Template For Values Pattern Language]]  

## The Spirit and Way 

These enumerated values are reflective of a unified and coherent [[Central Animating Spirit]], whose nature is [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

This Spirit of God results in our attempt to embody a non-propositional [[Way of Being]], rooted in Love and guided by Truth.  

## The Universal Core Values 

Among the [[Deepest]] Values on the list are: 
- [[Truth]]  
- [[Love]]  
- [[Justice]]  
- [[Stewardship]]  
- [[Wisdom]]  
- [[Beauty]]  

From [[One]] whose nature is [[Love]], and from these additional Core Values, all other values can be derived. 

## The Universal Derivative Values
