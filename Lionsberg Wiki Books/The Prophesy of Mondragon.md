# The Prophesy of Mondragon

It has been said that every [[Story]] is a [[Prophesy]] of something even greater that is possible. 

In 2018 and 2019, as we searched the world for alternative ways to govern our [[Selves]], we took two week long trips to [[Mondragon]] with the leading professor in the US and groups of graduate students to learn from the decades of experience, success, and struggle that resulted in the co-creation of one of the most successful co-operative economies in the world. 

The [[LIONSBERG System]] seeks to honor the wisest principles, values, and examples of what is working well in the Mondragon Experience, while attempting to step beyond it towards a [[New Human Operating System]] that could be offered to all 10 billion humans during the [[10 Year Grand Strategy]]. 

Here is the Story of Mondragon as a example of what is possible in every bioregion and locality of the world. 

## The Story 

Historically, life in the Mondragon region was dominated by a few rich industrialists, who paid the workers little and provided only minimal basic services. 

A priest name Jose Maria Arizmendiarietta began advocating for change. 

- 1936 to 1939 - Civil War. A time of deep strife and division.  
- In 1943, [[Arizmendi]] raised money from the local townspeople to start a school. 
- Convinced 11 local students to study engineering via correspondence, visiting [[Arizmendi]] to take the exams. 
- [[Arizmendi]] spent 10+ years traveling, speaking and giving conferences. People agreed with the ideas, but no one changed. Bad strategy. 
- Eventually after a decade of trying and failing to convince people to change, he reached the conclusion that it was not possible to transform the [[Old]] companies. 
- Instead, they would need to create our own [[New]] companies. 
- 1956 - Convinced 5 guys to quit and start the first [[Cooperative]] - ULGOR. 
	- [[Arizmendi]] did not take a position in any of the co-ops 
	- He encouraged self-government and self-organization - "Organize a group to do something - elect two coordinators, and I'll be back to check on you"
- 1959 - Discovered that existing financial mechanisms were not suited to the new paradigm, and started their own Bank   
- Throughout the inception, three primary elements were present: 
	- Daily sermons from Arizmendi / Religion  
	- Technical and Vocational Training / Work  
	- Social, Cultural, and Community Action 
		- Free time organizations  
		- Music, plays, parades, lotteries to raise money for the poor, debates, football clubs 
		- The social activity often engaged the youth, whose parents were fighting and divided  
- Emergence of a growing blend of for-profit and social organizations  
	- Cultural responsibility of the economic engine to fund valuable social goods  
	- Some of the organizations generate economic resources, others generate social and cultural riches so that everyone can live good lives  
	- Community coordination around resources and philanthropy - if we have $250k available, what are we going to do with it and why?  
- 1976 - Introduced Humanities Department to University 
- 1991 - shifted from regional to industry organization structure 
- 2011 - Introduced Gastronomy Department to University 
- 2016 - Revived Regional organizational structure (in addition to Industry) in order to fuel social innovation  
- Over time has grown out to: 
	- 100+ worker owned co-operatives  
	- 140 subsidiary organizations  
	- 26 umbrella companies and foundations 
	- 268 total organizations 
	- ~70,000+ co-operative members 
- The local myth of Mondragon (mount of the dragon)... 
	- Every year the dragon required the sacrifice of a virgin  
	- As opposed to an individual hero story, the dragon was killed co-operatively to liberate the town 

## The Importance of a Transformative and Uniting Purpose 

- To hold a diverse federation of organizations and activities, all purposes and goals must ultimately [[Stack Up And Align]] to the **Overarching and Uniting Purpose of the Federation**.  
- This requires a way to articulate, organize, and align individual and local Vision and Purpose, with the Highest Uniting Vision and Purpose. 
- For Mondragon, this is entrepreneurial development, job creation, and the co-operative culture and ethos. 
	- Partnering with God and One Another to co-create a better world  

## Continually Refreshing the Mission 

- Within this uniting Purpose, the Mission is regularly revisited with formal reevaluations every 4 years. 

## Values in Action 

- If you just use words, people think it is propaganda and shut it off 
- Demonstrate it in action, live it out, embody it, then back it up with the principles and concepts  
- If values are not applied and embodied, we do not really have them 
	- The often radical separation between the values discussed on Sunday and verbally assented to, and those embodied and lived out during the week 
- What form of self-governance, economy, and society enables us to translate these [[Universal Values]] into work and society and life with integrity? 
- Applied [[Universal Values]] clash with pop-culture values of consumption, leisure, whim, short-term gratification, false ideologies 

## Transformation From The Bottom Up

The core idea is the transformation of the world from the bottom up. 

To do that, you have to create [[New People]]. 

Transformed People -> Transformed Society. 

The primary way to elevate and transform humanity is through meaningful work and enlightening education. 

An integrated paradigm of Economic, Social, and Personal development in service to humanity. 

Mondragon is not a religious organization, however [[Arizmendi]] was a priest and placed a spiritual foundation underneath all that was built. 

## Self Governing, Self Sustaining, Self Replicating Groups and Teams 

As transformed people begin to collaborate to transform their lives and their world, the basic principle emerges of [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] groups and teams, in a blended ecosystem of for-profit and non-profit organizations. 

## Community Based Sense Making 

- [[Who Are We?]] 
- [[Where Are We?]]  
- [[How Did We Get Here?]]  
- [[Where Are We Going?]] / Where Do We Want To Go?  
- [[Why?]] 
- [[What Tools and Resources Do We Need?]]  
- [[What Do We Discern The Issues, Challenges, and Roadblocks Are?]] 

## Co-Operative Structure and Federation as a Tool / Process / Pattern 

- A co-operative is merely a tool 
- To accomplish the goal of what? 
	- Human and social development  
	- [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] groups and teams 
	- Co-operating with God and One Another to build a better society and finish our world. 
- The federation is merely a tool... 
	- So that each self-governing co-operative does not have to reinvent the wheel and struggle in isolation 
	- We are stronger together. 
- [[Solidarity]]  

## Co-Operative Entrepreneurial Spirit 

- The co-operative ethos revolves around the Spirit of Team Based Intrapreneurship  
	- They do not celebrate individual hero entrepreneurs, but rather Intrapreneurial teams that co-create new federated co-operatives   
- The [[Critical Path]] is prepare [[Teams]] of [[Intrapreneurs]] to tackle meaningful challenges and quests that make the world a better place  
- "We don't teach them, we help them learn"
- Key questions: 
	- What is the right reward for entrepreneurs in a society?  
	- Who "owns" the ideas, work, and good fortune that rises on top of such a society?  

## Core Enterprise / Headquarters - Powerful Help, With No Guarantees 

- The "federal" headquarters / core enterprise that serves 268 organizations and ~70,000 members (MCC) is intentionally kept as small as possible, with only about 60 members. 
- It's functions are limited to core services, communications, and coordination  
- This tiny size is made possible by the fact that all cooperatives in the system are Self Governing and Independent of the federation.
- MCC serves, helps, and supports the federation, but guarantees nothing among the independent co-ops  
- The basic model is: sovereign, autonomous co-ops with no central guarantees  
- Very important both culturally and legally that there is no perceived claim on the Whole  
	- For example, the largest co-op went bankrupt. Individual parts have to be able to be born, mature, and pass away without affecting the federation  
	- Ensure that the relationships between the [[Core Enterprise]] and the distributed network of [[Self-Governing, Self-Sustaining, and Self-Replicating]] Teams is arms length to protect against inevitable failures / attacks taking down The Whole  
- If a co-op gets into trouble, MCC will often help with restructuring out of [[Solidarity]], but has no obligation to do so  
- The priest said: Ask not what Society can do for you, but what you can do for Society. 
	- No entitlements, no welfare state, no central dependencies  

## Self Governance, Sovereignty, Autonomy, Responsibility  

- With every training we must reinforce - that each individual is the responsible first agent. 
- All teams are [[Self Governing]], [[Self Sustaining]], and Independent of the Federation  
- Every co-op is self governing and responsible for its own sustainability and success  
- If we believe in democracy and self-governance, shouldn't that also be applied to economics?  
- You are the first agent. No one is here to save you.  
- The "boss" is not responsible. You are. 
- The "federation" is not responsible. You are. 
- The federation and the elected leaders are there to serve and coordinate the Autonomy and Responsibility of the distributed network 
- Like a federation of City States  
- At the Team / Local Level 
	- Empowering those experiencing [[Issues]]...
	- ...to propose and implement [[Shared Solutions]]...
	- ...that lift up the Team...
	- ...and therefore the Co-Operative 
	- ...and therefore the Whole 
- Escaping dependency and paternalism 
	- Previously, life and work in the community was dominated by rich industrialists 
- Blame 
	- If the problem is ever outside the Conscious Agent, you will never improve 
	- [[Zero Blame Environment]]  
	- If something goes wrong, it is [[Us]] that must transform and improve  
	- If something is not clear or effective, it is because we were not persuasive, passionate, convincing, etc. 

## Five Big Ideas 

1. Dignity and Worth of Every Human Person  
2. Solidarity  
3. Work 
	- [[Meaningful Work]] is the positive [[Way]] we develop our [[Selves]] and our [[Society]]. 
	- In [[Mondragon]], the elders say _"We are helping God finish our world."_ 
	- [[Work]] is not a curse, but a primary source of Community, [[Purpose]] and [[Meaning]]. 
4. Education 
	- [[Arizmendi]] believed that education, along with meaningful work, were the core elements that transformed human beings. 
	- In Mondragon, [[Sirimiri]] is a [[Word Tool]] they use to point to a light little rain. [[Arizmendi]] used this as a metaphor for teaching, and would give little [[Fireside Chats]]. A little rain, a little enlightenment at a time, recognizing that the seeds of Wisdom and Knowledge take many years to grow. 
	- Future proofing workers through meta skills training  
	- "We don't teach them, we help them learn"
5. Self Governance, Responsibility, and Authority 
	- Every individual and co-operative is responsible for their own self-governance, self-learning and success  

## Aiming Towards The Ideal 

- We are continuously improving our understanding of The Ideal we are aiming towards 
- Foundations and other entities that are not technically organized as cooperatives still [[Act As If]] they were, to maintain the culture and values   

## The Gap Between Who We Are and The Ideal 

- There is ALWAYS a gap between [[Who We Are]] / [[Where We Are]] and the [[Ideal]] / [[Principles]] / [[Values]] we uphold and aspire to.  
- "There is always a gap, but at least there is a standard, and we hope there is less of a gap than with other organizations"  
- Striving to [[Co-Create]] practical Realities that conform ever more closely to the Foundational [[Ideal]] / [[Principles]] / [[Values]]  
- Evolution and bottom up transformation towards the [[Ideal]] - as opposed to revolution from the top down that leaves the social fabric of humanity fundamentally unchanged 
- It is not perfect. It is not a utopia. It is not a finished model. 
	- It is PROCESS for RISING towards unachievable perfection 
	- Aided by the Grace of God 
- It is not heaven. It is not utopia. We are human, we are trying to figure it out, and therefore it is imperfect. 
	- But we are striving to make it more perfect by getting a little better every day  
- [[Identifying And Solving Issues]] - Proposing solutions, implementing, learning, and continuously improving 

## Local Governance Structure 

- Every co-operative is self-governing 
- 1 member = 1 vote (at local and federal levels)  
- Individual Co-Ops have equal access to shared services and support, but no obligation to use them  
- Solidarity 
	- There are no unions vs. management - instead, full self-governance and self-ownership from the bottom up based on cooperation rather than factions and divisions  
- Salaries 
	- We are all Worker / Owner / Stewards, therefore there is nno "them" to guarantee [[Salaries]]  
	- [[Salaries]] are viewed as [[Advance Payments]] pending [[Final Accounting]]  
	- If what we pay our selves results in a loss, it comes out of our [[Capital Accounts]] 
	- Minimum wage is generally about 1.5x what the governance mandates  
	- Ratio of Lowest Paid to Highest Paid member is about 1:7 
		- Each level has decimals.  
		- Each position has a range written in the handbook, for instance 1.9 to 2.1
		- Compared to Spanish IBEX companies ~ 1:00  
		- Compared to United States ~ 1:330  
- Hiring and Onboarding (Intern -> Temp -> Member)
	- Everyone goes through internship, training and onboarding 
	- If they demonstrate that they are a hard worker and good cultural fit, they are given a 90 day trial 
	- If they succeed in the 90 day trial, they are awarded a 2-3 year temp contract 
	- After 3 years, either membership is offered, or the contract is terminated to make room for someone who can develop into a good long term member. 
	- Lesson Learned - this facilitates the churn that is needed to create space for those who truly have the heart and desire to become contributing members of the Society. 
- Member / Temp Ratio 
	- At any given time, roughly 85% worker / member / owners, 15% temp contracts  
- Performance Management 
	- Reviews every 1 to 2 years  
	- Very rare to fire  

## Federal Governance Structure 

- One Member One Vote 
- Every Member has the [[Right To Elect]], and the [[Right To Be Elected]]. 
- General Assembly 
	- Elected by Members 
	- Most important annual decisions 
	- 4 year terms 
	- 2 representatives from the smallest co-op, then graduated up according to size
	- Standing Committee - including a President 
- Governing Council 
	- Elected by General Assembly 
	- Given training on Management  
	- 3 year terms 
	- Responsible for appointing the General Manager 
- General Manager 
	- Nominates the Management Council 
	- Every 2 years, Governing Council "renews trust" in GM 
- Management Council 
	- Includes a Director for each Functional Department 
- Social Council 
	- Communication Body 
	- 1 to 2 year terms 
	- At all fractal levels down to every department 
	- Have 2 meetings per month
		- One meeting with Management Council and General Manager 
		- One meeting with their department 
			- Explain to their colleagues the [[Internal Context]] and [[External Context]] of the organization 
			- Discover questions, problems, needs, opportunities 
			- Relay answers to inquiries from previous month 
	- Mandatory to serve if you are elected, no additional compensation for the extra service 
- [[Decision Making]] and Consent 
	- Key decisions must be unanimous. 
	- Slow down and wait for the higher order solution to emerge, which reconciles all the apparently competing concerns 
	- If you vote and it is 5-4, or 8-1, maybe that minority is sensing something that is genuinely wrong and will block progress  
- No [[Campaigning]] 
	- If you say "vote for me", you are essentially automatically excluded from the contest 
- 1/2 the General Assembly ballot renewed every 2 years 
	- Governing Council proposes candidates to members 
	- Or - members select and unify around candidates  
- Co-operate internally, compete externally 
	- Strong culture of internal cooperation and mutual aid, not competition 

## Program Management 

- It takes strong community leadership and program management to coordinate: 
	- Schools  
	- Universities 
	- Community Organizations 
	- Non-Profit Organizations 
	- Cooperatives 
	- Resourcing Organizations  
	- Volunteers / Retirees

## Government Relations

- Over time they have successfully lobbied government repeatedly to change laws to allow for easier operations and compliance  

## Corporate Structure 

- 1st Degree Cooperatives - 
	- 102 Cooperatives 
	- Divided into 14 Divisions 
- 2nd Degree Cooperatives - "Co-Ops of Co-Ops" 
	- Grouped by Industry Areas
	- Divisions are like 2nd degree cooperatives 
	- The General Manager of the 2nd Degree Co-Op is VP of Division  
	- Every few years, the divisions rebalance 


## Federated Finances 

### Step 1: Restructuring Results 

- Recognizing that every individual co-op will at times struggle or have a bad year...
- In a spirit of solidarity 15% to 40% of results are spread between the divisions... 
- So that everyone "feels" gains and losses across the Whole 

### Step 2: Capital Allocation - Profitable Co-Ops

- 14% to MCC 
	- 10% to expand the System and create new jobs (Via Management Co) 
		- ~80% to infrastructure and technology improvements, job creation 
		- ~ 20% goes towards subsidies and the big bets / moonshots
			- Pooling central capital and de-risking / incentivizing moonshot projects that may provide a future for citizens 
	- 2% to help struggling co-ops (Via Foundations and subsidies)
	- 2% to help non-profit co-ops (Via Foundations and subsidies)

### Step 3: Taxes

### Step 4: Net Profits and Allocation of Capital 

- In general, most co-ops follow a model similar to: 
	- 10% - Minimum 10% for lifting up society, education 
	- 30% - worker profit sharing 
		- We share 30% of profits among us 
		- If you are a temp worker, it is cash 
		- If you are a member, it is Capital  
		- Profit sharing is often an additional 3 to 6 weeks of pay on average  
	- 60% - Capital Reserves and growth 

### Capital Accounts 

- Capital is viewed as a subordinate tool, to be used to: 
	- Improve our selves 
	- Improve our Society 
	- Help God finish our world 
- Everyone buys into The System- ~$15,000 Euros
	- Loans are available from the bank so there is no barrier to entry 
	- 20% is a fee to join The System 
	- 80% is your [[Initial Capital]]  
	- Skin in the game is critical, but should not be a barrier to entry. Resource ladders in place so that everyone has access 
- Capital is not available for withdraw until you retire, so that it is stays in [[Flow]] in The System  
	- If you so choose, you can leave Capital in when you [[Retirement|Retire]] 
- The General Assembly decides if they will pay interest each year, and at what rate 
	- Range from 0% to 7%  

### Inter-Cooperative Loans 

- Co-ops often lend to one another to solve short term cash issues 
- Low interest rates  
- Inter-Cooperative loans are backed by the Mondragon federation (up to a point) 
### Reporting, Audits, Checks and Balances 

- Regular reporting to MCC Headquarters 
- Annual audits - Trust and Verify! 
- Checks and Balances 
-  Close Attention and Disciplined Management 
### Financial Crises and Lessons learned

- Example: Bankruptcy of Fagor - largest co-op  
- Lenders and social security system made whole first, worker / member / owners last. 
- Lessons: 
	- Stop losses sooner (hope is often the last thing we lose) 
	- Face the harshest realities early and often 

## Functional Areas and Shared Services 

- "Social Management" - there are no [[Human Resources]]  
	- Social security for workers  
	- Job placements services between co-ops as various industries and organizations fluctuate in size 
	- If you are moved to another co-op, placed back on temporary contract for ~1 year while remaining a member of the old co-op for a year. 
	- If it is a good fit, you become a member in the new co-op and your capital moves 
		- If the old co-op is bankrupt, Mondragon puts in the 15k euros to restart your capital account with the new co-op
- General Purchasing Department 
	- Can join if you want, no obligation  
	- In all areas, protecting ability of [[Self Governing]] co-ops to do what is wise and right locally 
- Incubators and Labs 
	- Saiolan - business incubator for tech 
	- Incubates 16 companies / year  
	- Issue: 
		- Most incubated businesses are not co-operatives because _entrepreneurs don't want to give away_ (wrong understanding / cultural breakdown) 
	- Some university teachers work a few hours a month for Saiolan incubator 
- Central R&D to partner with each Co-Op
- Central service units also service outside organizations, not just Mondragon organizations 
- No obligation to use internal service units
	- Culturally encouraged, but no obligation. Internal service units have to perform. 
	- Small and medium co-ops tend to use more 
	- Larger co-ops tend to develop their own 
- Social Safety Nets 
	- Private Social Security
		- Up to 2 years if not working  
- R&D and other central services are also independent co-ops 
	- Must  market, contract, and ask for projects internally and externally 
	- Generate revenue internally and externally 
- Elkar-Lan 
	- 2nd degree cooperative whose mission is to promote cooperative employment 
	- Mostly very small coops of 2 to 4 people 
- Mondragon central looking to create co-ops that can employ 100s 
- Laboral Kutxa (which might be the bank)? has 20 person service to create companies 
- Gaztenpresa foundation 
	- in 2017 402 companies, only 700 employees 
	- Cultivating the entrepreneurial gene 

## Innovation and Cross-Pollination 
- There is a central R&D co-op to partner with all businesses and cross-pollinate solutions 
	- The best processes, practices, and technologies cross-pollinated and cross-innovated among a variety of co-ops 
- M4 Future Innovation Model - on web page 
- "The R&D department of each co-op is the most important" 
	- Each co-op has an innovation and technology center 
- Innovation is in our DNA, starting with our cooperative structure 
- Long term innovative ethos: Renew facilities, buy new machines, never rest or become complacent or arrogant 
- Executives go on missions to other industries and other parts of the world to see what they are doing, learn, cross-pollinate   
- There is always one more step to be done. The moment you become satisfied, it is the beginning of the end 

## AI, Robotics, Automation 

- Even by 2018, Mondragon was beginning to sense a shift to where most available jobs where reserved for those with advanced vocational training or better  
	- Anticipating that by 2030 to 2035 most of the low to mid skill jobs gone  
- Anticipating the advent of disruptive technology that could cause 40% plus of jobs to disappear  
- Estimating that without major changes, 40% of the population would be unable to participate in the economy  
- What is the next wave of [[Meaningful Work]] for students and blue collar workers with the coming wave of AI, automation, and robotics?  
- How can we deal with increasing globalization and the dramatic wage and production disparities? 
	- "Can't pay 25x the wages of other countries and still be competitive"  
- Innovation and Education are the key  
- Transforming towards smart cities  
- Manufacturing 4.0 
	- Automated, and moved back in-country / on-shore  
	- Bioregional manufacturing hubs  
	- Automation, Additive Manufacturing, [[Just In Time]] supply chains 
- Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Automation 
- Big Data  
- Raw Materials - Doing more with less 

## Food Systems 

- Local gastronomic societies  
- Co-operatively run dinner clubs  
- Local, organic, regenerative agriculture

## Reflections From Executives On What is Not Working 

-  [[Arizmendi]] spent 10 years speaking and giving conferences. People agreed with the ideas, but no one changed. Bad strategy. 
	- Therefore, he had to convince a small group of individuals to start the first co-op, and begin assembling the federation. 
	- The [[Old]] is difficult to transform 
	- [[New Wine]] requires [[New Wineskins]]  
- One of the largest Co-Ops broke the code and sold
	- Barcelona co-op sold out to a great offer from Cemex... 
	- Everyone walked away with millions locally, while damaging the federation. 
	- The temptation of short term local gain at the expense of the Whole 
- The largest Co-Op went bankrupt 
	- After Fagor backruptcy, 1,900 employees demonstrated against Mondragon and sued 
	- Break in training, culture, values, understanding  
- Culture 
	- Something went wrong in the training that allowed for this. 
	- Need to rethink, and reinforce with every speech that YOU are responsible first. 
	- You are the first agent 
	- [[Zero Blame Environment]]  
	- No central dependencies or guarantees

	- Year zero / onboarding 
	- Year one 
	- Year two 
	- Year three  
	- Then ongoing maintenance 
	- It takes 2-3 years for a worker to truly feel connected, empowered, and part of the culture and process 
- General Assembly Meetings have become very short
	- There are many people, and debate is unusual 
	- When they ask if there are any issues or objections, usually silence 
	- Are issues and minority vote going unseen? 
- Blame
	- If the problem is ever outside the Conscious Agent, you will never improve... 
	- If something goes wrong, it is us that must transform 
	- If something is not clear, it is because we were not persuasive, passionate, convincing, etc.
