"The transcendence that the church preaches is not alienation; it is not going to heaven to think about eternal life and forget about the problems on earth. It’s a transcendence from the human heart. It is entering into the reality of a child, of the poor, of those wearing rags, of the sick, of a hovel, of a shack. It is going to share with them. And from the very heart of misery, of this situation, to transcend it, to elevate it, to promote it, and to say to them, “You aren’t trash. You aren’t marginalized.” It is to say exactly the opposite, “You are valuable.”" - [[Oscar Romero]]

“The survival of mankind cannot be secured in isolation from other living beings, such as crawling, swimming, winged and four-legged relatives, as well as plants, trees and minerals. In order to achieve the much needed and desired balance of peace, universal love must be allowed to grow. A love that literally allows every person and thing to blossom, as the power of the sun’s rays helps. So the survival of mankind depends on everyone – not just us natives. Only when we realize that we cannot separate from other living beings on earth do we bring about positive change.   
We have to include the unborn up to the seventh generation in our deliberations in advance in order to find our way.”  - Reymundo Tigre Perez, medicine man from the Purépechas

In order that men should embrace the truth—not in the vague way they did in childhood, nor in the one-sided and perverted way presented to them by their religious and scientific teachers, but embrace it as their highest law—the complete liberation of this truth from all and every superstition (both pseudo-religious and pseudo-scientific) by which it is still obscured is essential. - Leo Tolstoy 

When an individual passes from one period of life to another a time comes when he cannot go on in senseless activity and excitement as before, but has to understand that although he has outgrown what before used to direct him, this does not mean that he must live without any reasonable guidance, but rather that he must formulate for himself an understanding of life corresponding to his age, and having elucidated it must be guided by it. And in the same way a similar time must come in the growth and development of humanity. I believe that such a time has now arrived. - Leo Tolstoy 

A commercial company enslaved a nation comprising two hundred millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he will fail to grasp what these words mean. What does it mean that thirty thousand men, not athletes but rather weak and ordinary people, have subdued two hundred million vigorous, clever, capable, and freedom-loving people? Do not the figures make it clear that it is not the English who have enslaved the Indians, but the Indians who have enslaved themselves? - Leo Tolstoy 

New justifications have now appeared in place of the antiquated, obsolete, religious ones. These new justifications are just as inadequate as the old ones, but as they are new their futility cannot immediately be recognized by the majority of men... But by the term 'scientific' is understood just what was formerly understood by the term 'religious': just as formerly everything called 'religious' was held to be unquestionable simply because it was called religious, so now all that is called 'scientific' is held to be unquestionable. - Leo Tolstoy 

Be not the destroyers of yourselves. Arise to your true Being, and then you will have nothing to fear. - Krishna 

People saw more and more clearly, and now the majority see quite clearly, the senselessness and immorality of subordinating their wills to those of other people just like themselves, when they are bidden to do what is contrary not only to their interests but also to their moral sense. - Leo Tolstoy 

For a long time people lived in this obvious contradiction without noticing it. - Leo Tolstoy 

..but this truth was so interwoven everywhere with all kinds of falsehoods which distorted it, that finally nothing of it remained but words. - Leo Tolstoy 

Of what use is superior knowledge in the one, if he does not endeavour to relieve his neighbour's want as much as his own? - The Hindu Kural 

Amid this life based on coercion, one and the same thought constantly emerged among different nations, namely, that in every individual a spiritual element is manifested that gives life to all that exists, and that this spiritual element strives to unite with everything of a like nature to itself, and attains this aim through love. - Leo Tolstoy 

Thus the truth—that his life should be directed by the spiritual element which is its basis, which manifests itself as love, and which is so natural to man—this truth, in order to force a way to man's consciousness, had to struggle not merely against the obscurity with which it was expressed and the intentional and unintentional distortions surrounding it, but also against deliberate violence, which by means of persecutions and punishments sought to compel men to accept religious laws authorized by the rulers and conflicting with the truth. - Leo Tolstoy 

All that exists is One. People only call this One by different names. - The Vedas 

God is love, and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. - I John 

## Selah 14 

"The Dark Ages still reign over all humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. This prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by misorientation and built of misinformation. We are powerfully imprisoned ... by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think." - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"There is now plenty for all. War is obsolete. It is imperative that we get the word to all humanity — RUSH — before someone ignorantly pushes the button that provokes pushing of all the buttons." - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"In its complexities of design integrity, the Universe is technology. The technology evolved by man is thus far amateurish compared to the elegance of nonhumanly contrived regeneration. Man does not spontaneously recognize technology other than his own, so he speaks of the rest as something he ignorantly calls nature." - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"Amongst other grand strategies for making the world work and taking care of everybody is the design science revolution of providing ever more effective tools and services with ever less, real resource investment per each unit of end performance. For instance, a communications satellite, weighing only one-quarter of a ton, is now out-performing the transoceanic communication capabilities of 175 thousand tons of copper cable." - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

“This is what man tends to call utopia. It's a fairly small word, but inadequate to describe the extraordinary new freedom of man in a new relationship to the universe – the alternative of which is oblivion.” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

“Whether it is to be Utopia or Oblivion will be a touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment…. Humanity is in a final exam as to whether or not it qualifies for continuance in the Universe” - [[Buckminster Fuller]]  

"How would you like this world to be? We have been here a long time as human beings, and we have never listened to one another answer this question." - Gregory Flint 

"We can only believe what in we can first imagine." - Gregory Flint 

"If we don't believe that our world can get better, it probably won't. What would it take for you to begin to believe?" - [[Gregory Flint]] 

"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere." - [[Albert Einstein]]  

"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one." - [[Albert Einstein]]  

"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." - [[Albert Einstein]]  

"No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it." - [[Albert Einstein]]  

"An obvious but hidden insight is that unenlightened beings cannot create enlightened systems. Creation begins with Consciousness."
