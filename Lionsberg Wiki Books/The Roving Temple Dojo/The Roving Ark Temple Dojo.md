## Concept  

Create a **10+ year survivable**, cold-capable, off-grid, low-maintenance live/work platform with:

• **Bulletproof mechanical baseline**  
• **Passive + wood heat**  
• **Simple water system protected from freezing**  
• **Redundant low-tech cooking**  
• **Modular sleeping + working core**  
• **Controlled air & moisture environment**  
• **Tool-serviceable everything**  
  
This is not a “conversion.” It is a **field base**. Temple. Sanctuary. Monastery. Dojo. Healing Center. Initiation Portal. Forward operating base. 

This bus is:
• **The first Sanctuary**
• **The first University Cell**
• **The first Mobile Embassy of the New Civilization**
  
Not a vehicle. Not a house.
A **Temple on Wheels**.

A **traveling House of the Logos**, carrying the Pattern into the world.
  
Theme: Monastic Minimalism. 
  
- Can become **a true sanctuary**
- Can house **2-3 people without psychological compression**
- Can function as **command center + dwelling + workshop**
- Can integrate **motorcycle + e-bike + gear + wood + water + library**
- Can be **heated efficiently**
- Is **stealth lite** (looks like civic infrastructure)
- Is **repairable indefinitely** in a collapse scenario.
- And has an **ADA lift**, which no survivor on Earth would think to ask for — but is absolutely game-changing.
  
- Keep the **library shelves**: they add thermal mass, structure, and anchor points.
- Assume wall insulation is mediocre; **upgrade from the inside** with removable layers.
- Prioritize **redundant heat**, airtightness, condensation control, and a warm floor.
- Partition a **rear garage bay** (lift area) and keep the living cabin tighter/warmer.
  
**SIMPLE → REPAIRABLE → LOCAL → TOOL-REPRODUCIBLE → NON-FRAGILE**
  
Build once.
Build slow, simple, durable.  
Zero RV flimsy plastic anything 
  
We avoid:
- Complex electrical controllers
- High-pressure propane dependencies
- Excessive cabinetry / trim
- RV appliances 
- RV propane fridges  
- RV ovens 
  
We lean into
- No Complexity = No fail points
- Low Tech Living 
- Staying Warm  
- Keeping Nutrition Stable  
- Minimizing Failure Points  
- Everything Repairable with Hand Tools 
- **Household and Marine Grade - no RV**
- **Wood stove + diesel heat**
- **Chest Freezer as Fridge** (If power avail)
- **Gravity-fed or foot pump water**
- **Simple mechanical systems**
- **Modular storage**
- **Everything accessible & repairable by one person**
  
Build in 3/4” plywood + cedar + foam + wool + linseed oil  
Keep wiring simple and modular  
  
Repairable. 
Warm. 
Quiet. 
Invisible. 
Fully Sovereign.  
Sustainable for a decade+  
Able to feed and shelter 2-4 people in winter 
  

## Strategy 

Front load reliability and structure… 
Layer comfort and capability…
Minimum viable build and move-in.  
Continuous improvement as the sanctuary gets in flow. 

## Layout & Zones  

1. Forward Cockpit & Sun Room  
2. Command / Tea / Navigation Desk  
3. Reception, Galley, and Stove   
4. The Warm Core / Tatami Zone (mid-bus)  
	1. Sit / Sleep / train / relate / meditate / commune  
5. The Armory / Workshop / Forge / Gear / Mobility Bay 
	1. Where equipment is maintained.  Tools are sharpened. Repairs are made. Mobility is stored.
	2. Safe 
	3. Cold storage  
	4. Tools and equipment  
	5. Wardrobe  
	6. Bike 
6. Rear Lift
7. Sky Deck 
8. Maintain front to back Library Shelving bones - thermal + structural advantage 
  
## Lifestyle Assumptions  
- **Low-electricity food strategies** (soaking, sprouting, fermentation, clay pots, low-heat stews)
- **Wood heat primary** (or diesel)
- **Device & laptop use off-grid deliberate, not constant**
- **Starlink use off-grid intermittent, not continuous**

## Systems Requirements and Architecture 

### Bus and Chassis 

### Insulation 

- Heavy thermal blackout screen for bus front windows  
- Heavy thermal blackout screen for bus back window 
- Heavy thermal curtain behind Driver’s Seats  
- Heavy thermal curtain across rear garage partition  
- Curtains ≈ (reflectix core + cloth both sides)
- Ceiling - 1/2” polyiso + thin thermal baffle + fabric liner (or cedar T&G) 
- Floor ~0.25” - 0.5” insulation and rugs 
- Preserve full posture and warmth 
- **Thermal curtains**  across cockpit, rear garage partition, and any cold seams.  
- If parked in winter - insulated skirting panels around bus belly to cut drafts  

#### EMF Insulation 


### Heating  

Marine wood stove (deep winter anchor, drying gear, radiant comfort) 

- Cubic Mini Grizzly 
- Wall Heat Shield  
- Roof Flue (double walled pipe)  
- Dedicated wood storage  

Fuel: downed wood + scrap + sticks = unlimited 

- 2 kW or 5kW Diesel heater (baseline heat 80% of time) 

This combination should heat the bus down to -20 degrees.

#### **Selected Diesel Heater**
##### **Autoterm / Planar 2D (a.k.a. Autoterm Air 2D) – 2 kW – 12V**
  
**Why it was chosen:**

- **Most reliable long-term diesel heater on Earth**
    
- Fully serviceable with _no proprietary electronics lockout_
    
- Made in Latvia, _not_ China → extremely high build quality
    
- Very low electrical draw — ideal for off-grid battery systems
    
- Excellent cold-weather performance (−40°F capable)
    
- Full ecosystem of **marine-grade stainless accessories**
    
- Safe for **sleeping environments** (sealed combustion)
    
  
**Chosen configuration included:**

- Stainless floor mounting plate
    
- External muffler
    
- Rubber vibration isolators
    
- Digital _PU-27_ controller
    
- High-altitude mode
    
- 2–3 gallon dedicated diesel tank **OR** tie-in to vehicle tank


- For the Ark, you still need to add:
    
    1. A **diesel source**: either a small dedicated tank or a tap into your main tank.
        
    2. **Exhaust finishing**: through-hull/wall fitting, optional muffler, insulation, and possibly extra exhaust length.
        
    3. **Extra warm-air duct and vents** only if you want more distribution than a single outlet.
        
    4. **Install consumables**: extra wire, loom, grommets, sealant, hardware.
        
    5. **Fire/heat shielding** near exhaust and wood.

____
For your context — an off-grid/mobile/wilderness/sovereign living platform (like your bus sanctuary and potential camps) — the **optimum cooking setup** needs to be:

- **Independent of grid and fragile systems**
    
- **Resilient across seasons (esp. deep winter)**
    
- **Multi-fuel and multi-method** capable
    
- **Safe, efficient, and healthy**
    
- **Capable of joyfully nourishing individuals and groups**
    
  
Let’s break this down into an **Optimal Cooking Setup Stack** organized by _heat source_, _cooking method_, _scale_, and _context_. Then we can design your perfect kit and systems.

### Cleaning 

### Rest, Reading, and Tea

### Library 
- Books to distribute (donations)  
- Practice manuals  
- Personal library  
### Music

- Acoustic guitars  
- Cajon  
- Hand Drum  
- Djembe  
- Flutes  
- Digital Piano?  
	- Possibly Murphy Style?  
- Electric Guitar?  
- Instrument Storage Strategy 
- Roland Cabinet Amp for seating (and PA)

### Sacred Space 

- Small shrine  
- Symbols of alignment  
- Ever burning candle?  
- Staff

### Bathing  

1. ✅ Portable Nemo shower 
2. ✅ Collapsable container 

Phase II: Small on demand propane unit? (Joolca type?)  

### Toilet 

✅ Phase I: Luggable loo

Phase II: Urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDC) 

Stealth & Sovereignty: No dump-station dependency, no blue chemicals, no freeze-risk in exposed tanks.

**Odor control:** With constant micro-vent, UDDTs are the least smelly option.

**Winter resilience:** No exterior plumbing to freeze; everything stays inside the warm envelope.

**Toilet unit:** Commercial UDDT (e.g., Nature’s Head/Air Head/Kildwick) _or_ a robust DIY box using a urine-diverter funnel.

**Ventilation:** Dedicated **12V always-on** exhaust fan (computer fan or marine vent) pulling from toilet box to **roof vent** (1–1.5” PVC). This keeps the toilet box under slight **negative pressure** so no odor escapes indoors—even in sub-zero. Vent fan stays on 24/7 (draw is minimal). If you must switch off, crack a roof vent slightly.

**Solids containers:** 2–3 × 10–12 L lidded bins (gamma-seal lids recommended) rotated as they fill. Cover material (see below) added each use.

**Urine containers:** 3–6 × 4–5 gal HDPE carboys with quick-connect caps; store warm, strapped low. Swap daily; move via the ADA lift.

**Cover material (carbon):** Fine **coco coir**, **sifted sawdust**, or **shredded leaves** kept bone-dry in a sealed tote adjacent to toilet. Add a light scoop after each solids use.

**Hygiene:** Wall pump bottle with dilute vinegar or enzyme spray for bowl/seat; paper only (no wipes) into solids.

**Urine Throughput / Cadence:** ~3–5 gal/day total. With 5-gal carboys you’re swapping **daily**. (This is good—it keeps logistics simple and fresh.)

**Solids Throughput / Cadence:** Typically **one 10–12 L bin every 2–3 days** for 3 adults with cover; rotate & seal.

**Urine Disposal**: Dilute 1:10 with water and apply to non-edible trees   
**Solids Disposal**: Off-site thermophilic composing

Identify a compact bathroom compartment 30" - 34" x 30" with a heavy privacy curtain and nightlight.  
Adjacent cabinet holds  
- Two totes of dry cover material  
- Spare Solids Bags 
- Urine carboy rotation staging  
- Cleaning supplies  
- Service path - make sure ADA lift path can move full carboys/bins to back for transport

Operations: 
- Line bucket with compostable bag  
- When full, tie shut  
- Transport to contractor bag inside dry tote in rear bus storage  
- Dispose at landfill or pit toilet  

There is zero odor when the diverter + fan + cover protocol are done correctly. 
You are not disposing of waste. You are keeping water pure, respecting sacred soil, returning matter to the great cycle, leaving every place better than you found it…


### Water

7 to 15 gal jerry can modules 
	- vs. 40 - 60 gallon tank?  
	- 4x15 gallon jerry cans?

    - Manual pump + strainer, PEX or reinforced hose, ball valves.
        
    - Manual backup: gravity jug + spigot or hand pump.
        
    
3. **Hot water**
    
    - Phase 1: stovetop kettle + propane or wood stove for all hot water needs.
        
    - Phase 2 (upgrade): compact propane on-demand heater with quick-connect, serving a handheld shower & optionally sink.
        
    
4. **Sinks & wash**
    
    - One deep stainless kitchen sink with quality faucet.
        
    - Collapsible basin(s) for hand/face washing & small laundry.
        
    
5. **Shower**
    
    - Collapsible tub indoors + handheld sprayer.
        
    - Outdoor quick-connect shower line + curtain/tent.
        
    
6. **Grey water**
    
    - 15–20 gal grey tank (preferably interior, emptied daily).
        
    - Easy-access dump valve + hose fitting; bypass option for emergencies.

- Titled portable ground array  
- Posible fixed solar later after usage study  
- 48 v hybrid system  
- Modular. Expandable. Avoid complex wiring nightmares.
- Why 48V? Lower current → smaller cables/heat, higher inverter efficiency, easier to scale. It’s the “right-sized” backbone for a sanctuary bus.  
- Why 12V? 
- Intuition - get a large batter stack to power everything, plan on refilling from shore and generator primarily  

Here’s the clean “ultimate $5k Ark power plan” I’d run with, given everything we’ve already designed for the Ark (VL60 fridge, manual water, wood stove, minimal but robust 12V spine).
  

### **Build a perfect DC system:**

- EcoWorthy 12V 300Ah: **$429** (x2) 
    
- 200W–400W suitcase solar: **$249–$399** (x2) 
    
- DC fuse box, wiring, breakers: **$125** 
    
- 40A DC-DC charger (from alternator or generator AC → DC adapter): **$180**
    
- 1,000W pure sine inverter: **$120**
    
- Ultra-efficient DC fan system: **$50**
    
- LED DC lighting throughout the cabin: **$50–$80**
    
  

This entire system would:

- Last 8–12+ years
    
- Be silent
    
- Work in prolonged grid down
    
- Not require proprietary parts
    
- Cost less than 1 Delta Pro
    
- Be more rugged
    
- Integrate cleanly with the Ark as a semi-permanent install
    

  

**This is entirely aligned with your 10-year survival architecture.**

- Or [EcoFlow Delta Pro](https://us.ecoflow.com/products/delta-pro-portable-power-station?variant=41646325661769)

### ANOTHER TAKE ON THE SYSTEM 

  
**Battery Bank layout**

- Wire the 2 (eventually 3) batteries in **parallel** with **short, fat jumpers** (2/0 AWG).
    
- Take all main connections (to fuse, busbars, shunt) from **opposite ends** of the parallel bank to keep currents balanced.
    

---

## **2. High-Current Backbone: Fuses, Shunt, Busbars, Cables**

  

This is the “spine” everything hangs off.

  

### **a) Main battery fuse**

- Put a **300A Class-T fuse + holder** within ~7–12” of the positive battery post feeding the DC system.
    
- This protects against catastrophic short anywhere downstream (inverter later, MPPT, DC-DC, loads).
    

  

**Option**

- **VOZINMOST 300A Class T Fuse Holder with 300A fuse**
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FB8HG1QB 
    

### **b) Busbars (positive & negative)**

From the Class-T fuse, run to **300A busbars** that all major devices land on.

- **300A Heavy Duty Module Bus Bar, red & black pair**
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2Z8LMZB 
    

These give you:

- A tidy place to land: MPPT, DC-DC charger, DC fuse block, future inverter, etc.
    
- Room for the 3rd battery and 1200W array without re-building the core.
    

  
### **c) Battery monitor (shunt)**

  

Between battery negative and negative busbar, insert a **500A smart shunt**.

- **Victron Energy SmartShunt 500A 12/24/48V**
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ2P2XN5 
    
  
This gives you:

- True state of charge, amps in/out, time to empty, history.
    
- Bluetooth to the VictronConnect app (same as your MPPT).
    
  
### **d) Main battery cables**

For the main DC spine and future inverter, treat this as a **2/0 AWG system**.

- **2/0 Battery Cable, 10ft Red + 10ft Black, OFC**
    
    Example: Geosiry 2/0 welding cable
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DM5HRXKQ 
    

  

You’ll also want:

- **Lug kit** (2/0 AWG copper lugs + heat shrink) – pick any well-reviewed 2/0 lug & heat shrink kit on Amazon.
    
- A hydraulic crimper if you don’t already have one.
    

---

## **3. Solar Input: 800W Portable (→1200W), MPPT Controller**

  

### **a) Portable solar: 2× 400W Renogy suitcases**

  

Start with **2 suitcases of 400W each** (800W), with the option to add a third suitcase later (1200W). Each suitcase lives as its own deployable object; nothing on the roof.

- **Renogy 400W Portable Solar Panel Suitcase**
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4LMVKYD 
    

  

These are designed to plug into portable power stations, but for your system:

- **Bypass or remove** any small built-in PWM controller they ship with.
    
- Run **raw panel output via MC4** to your Victron MPPT.
    

  

You’ll also need:

- **MC4 extension cables** (10 AWG, red/black, maybe 20–30 ft)
    
- **MC4 Y-branch connectors** to parallel the suitcases at the controller end.
    

  

(Any reputable 10AWG MC4 wire and branch connectors on Amazon work.)

  

### **b) Solar charge controller: Victron SmartSolar MPPT 150/70**

  

We sized this for:

- 800W now at 12V → ~800 / 12 ≈ 67A.
    
- 1200W later → you’ll “top out” at 70A on very bright days, but that’s fine: oversizing array yields better harvest in shoulder seasons and clouds.
    

  

**Controller**

- **Victron SmartSolar MPPT 150/70 MC4 VE.Can (Bluetooth)**
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KFKM7MV 
    

  

Wiring:

1. **Panels → MPPT PV input**
    
    - Suitcases in parallel via MC4 Y-branches.
        
    - MC4 extension down to controller.
        
    - Add inline MC4 fuses if you want belt-and-suspenders when you have 3 suitcases.
        
    
2. **MPPT → DC bus**
    
    - MPPT + output → **small breaker or MIDI/ANL fuse (~80–100A)** → **positive busbar**.
        
    - MPPT – output → **negative busbar** (on the battery side of the shunt so current is measured).
        
    

---

## **4. Alternator Charging: Renogy 40A DC–DC**

  

When the bus is moving, you want the alternator quietly topping the house bank.

  

**Charger**

- **Renogy 12V 40A DC-to-DC On-Board Battery Charger (LiFePO₄ compatible)**
    
    Amazon search: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Renogy+12V+40A+DC+to+DC+On-Board+Battery+Charger 
    

  

Why 40A:

- Gentle on the alternator, still meaningful charge.
    
- If someday you want more, you can parallel a second unit or upgrade.
    

  

Wiring:

- **Input side (from start battery / alternator):**
    
    - Start battery + → fuse (60A) → DC-DC input +.
        
    - Start battery – or chassis ground → DC-DC input –.
        
    
- **Output side (to house bank):**
    
    - DC-DC output + → **house positive busbar** (fused at 60A near the bus).
        
    - DC-DC output – → **negative busbar**.
        
    

  

Set the charger profile to **LiFePO₄**.

---

## **5. Generator / Shore Charging (Phase II)**

  

For now, you can:

- Use the generator to power your **existing AC loads** and a **plug-in AC battery charger** when you choose one (e.g., a Victron Blue Smart IP22 12/30 or 12/50).
    

  

I’d treat the **AC charger as a Phase II add**, once the rest of the DC spine is in and you’ve lived with solar + alternator for a bit.

---

## **6. DC Distribution: Loads (Fridge, Lights, Heater, Fans, Starlink)**

  

All the “small” loads land on a **fused DC distribution block** fed from the busbars.

  

### **a) DC fuse block**

- **12-Way Marine Fuse Block with Negative Bus & Cover, 100A total, 12 circuits**
    
    Example: BEISUOS 12-way fuse block
    
    Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSMMH91R 
    

  

Feed it like this:

- From **positive busbar** → **main feed fuse (say 60–80A)** → **fuse block +**.
    
- From **negative busbar** → **fuse block –**.
    

  

Then:

- Each load (fridge, lights, diesel heater later, fans, USB/DC outlets, Starlink supply, etc.) gets:
    
    - Its own fused circuit on the **+ side**, correct gauge wire.
        
    - Return on the **– bus** of the block.
        
    

  

You can reserve:

- 1× 15A fused circuit for the **VL60 DC fridge**.
    
- 1× 10A for **diesel heater** (if/when installed).
    
- 1× 10A for **Starlink** (either DC or feeding a small inverter).
    
- Several 5A circuits for **lights, fans, pump relays, USB outlets**, etc.
    

  

### **b) Wire for branch circuits**

- 10 AWG for longer runs / heavier loads (fridge, heater, Starlink).
    
- 12–14 AWG for lights and lighter gadgets.
    

  

Pick a **marine-grade duplex wire** (tinned copper, nice sheath) in 10/2 and 12/2 as needed.

---

## **7. Optional: Future Inverter**

  

You can **skip an inverter for now** and:

- Use the **generator** for heavy AC loads.
    
- Keep the DC bank focused on fridge, comms, lights, and heater.
    

  

Later, if you want a quiet AC option:

- Add a **2000W pure sine inverter** wired directly from the busbars via its own **Class-T or 300A MEGA fuse** and short 2/0 cables.
    

  

No need to buy it in this Black-Friday window unless a must-have deal appears.

20. **Ring terminals & ferrules** for 10–14 AWG.
    

---

### **Nice-to-Have Now / Easy Phase II**

  

(Not strictly required to commission the DC spine, but worth flagging.)

- **AC charger for generator/shore** (e.g., Victron Blue Smart IP22 12/30 or 12/50).
    
- **2000W pure sine inverter** if you want quiet AC without firing the generator.
    

---

If you’d like, next step I can:

- Map **exact wiring diagrams** (one-line schematic) for:
    
    - Batteries → fuse → shunt → busbars
        
    - Solar → MPPT → busbars
        
    - Alternator → DC-DC → busbars
        
    - Busbars → DC fuse block → named loads (VL60, lights, heater, Starlink, etc.)
        
    
- Or we can zoom into **one segment at a time** (e.g., just the MPPT and portable solar plumbing) and detail connection by connection and fuse sizing.

#### FINAL TAKE 

Here is **the complete, end-to-end Ark 12V Electrical System**—**final form**, with **AC inverter**, **shore/generator charger**, **alternator charging**, **800W expandable solar**, **600–900Ah LiFePO₄**, and **every cable, fuse, lug, and connection spelled out**.
  
No steps skipped. No missing parts. No assumptions required.
This is the **entire build** beginning to end.

- **300A rated busbars (positive + negative)**
    

---

##### **III. HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS**
  
###### **1 — Power IN**

- Solar → MPPT → Bus → Battery
    
- Alternator → DC–DC → Bus → Battery
    
- Shore or Generator → AC Charger → Bus → Battery
    
  
###### **2 — Power OUT**

- Battery → DC Fuse Block → 12V loads
    
- Battery → 2/0 → Inverter (2000W) → AC outlets
    
  
###### **3 — Intelligence**

- SmartShunt = full monitoring
    
- MPPT = solar optimization
    
- DC–DC = alternator safety
    
- AC Charger = shore/generator integration
    

---

##### **IV. COMPLETE INSTALLATION: STEP-BY-STEP**
  
This is the part most people never document. You get it in full.

---

###### **STEP 1 — Build the Battery Core**

1. Place **both ECO-WORTHY 300Ah batteries** in the power bay
    
2. Tie batteries **in parallel**:
    
    - Positive to positive (2/0 cable)
        
    - Negative to negative (2/0 cable)
        
    
3. Connect common positive to:
    
    - 300A Class-T fuse
        
    - Then to positive busbar
        
    
4. Connect common negative to:
    
    - SmartShunt
        
    - Then to negative busbar
        
    
  
**Result: Your battery bank is now alive, monitored, and safe.**

---

###### **STEP 2 — Install High-Current Architecture**

1. Mount **positive and negative busbars**
    
2. Mount **Class-T fuse** within 7–12 inches of battery
    
3. Connect busbars with heavy gauge cables as designed
    
4. Create ring terminals, heat shrink every endpoint
    
  
This is the beating heart of the system.
Done once, lasts 10–20 years.

---

###### **STEP 3 — Install the MPPT Solar Controller**

1. Mount MPPT near batteries (short cable = efficiency)
    
2. Battery → MPPT with 6 AWG
    
3. Solar panels → MPPT via MC4 → PV terminals
    
4. Add 40A inline fuse on solar side if needed
    

---

###### **STEP 4 — Install the Alternator DC–DC Charger**

1. Run 8 AWG wire from starter battery to DC–DC input
    
2. Add 40A inline fuse near starter battery
    
3. Output of DC–DC goes to positive bus
    
4. Grounds go to chassis and negative bus
    
  
Now your alternator charges the house safely.

---

###### **STEP 5 — Install AC Charger (shore/generator)**

1. Mount the Victron IP22 or ProNautic
    
2. AC input = shore OR generator
    
3. DC output goes to positive bus (30A breaker inline)
    
4. Negative to negative bus
    
  
Now anytime you plug in OR fire the generator, the Ark recharges.

---

###### **STEP 6 — Install 2000W Pure Sine Inverter**

1. Place inverter close to battery bank
    
2. Connect with 2/0 cables
    
3. Add 200A ANL fuse on positive
    
4. AC output → small subpanel OR dual outlets
    

---

###### **STEP 7 — Install 12V DC Distribution**

1. Mount Blue Sea fuse block
    
2. Run 12/2 marine duplex cable from block to:
    
    - VL60 fridge
        
    - LED lights
        
    - Starlink router
        
    - Diesel heater (future)
        
    - USB ports
        
    - Fans
        
    
3. Fuse each circuit appropriately

Then we discussed a full concert / PA capable system... and were able to upgrade to it for ~$600

Here is **exactly** how your upgraded Ark power system will interface with **amps, keyboards, mics, mixers, lights, PA systems — and what (if anything) is needed for the next level.**

  

You are now in an EXCELLENT position. A **3,000 W / 6,000 W surge Renogy pure sine** plus **900 Ah LiFePO₄** is _ridiculously capable_.

  

Let’s break this down step-by-step:

---

# **✅ 1. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOUR DEVICES PLUG INTO?**

  

### **A. All AC musical equipment plugs into the AC OUTPUT of the inverter**

  

That includes:

- Roland pro digital piano
    
- Roland keyboard amp
    
- Line 6 guitar amp
    
- Any PA system (500W, 1000W, even 1500W is fine)
    
- Mixers / audio interface
    
- Stage monitors
    
- Pedal boards
    
- Podcast gear (Rodecaster / mics / interfaces)
    
- LED lights and stage lighting
    

  

**The inverter is your “wall outlet” for absolutely everything AC.**

  

### **Wiring Landscape**

- The **Renogy 3000 W pure sine** has either:
    
    **(1) AC terminals**, or **(2) built-in AC receptacles** (depending on model).
    

  

Either way you complete with:

  

### **Option 1 — Wall-Style Panel Outlet**

  

You install a **standard AC outlet box** downstream of the inverter.

  

**Example:**

- A small **surface-mount 2-socket AC outlet** mounted on the wall.
    
- Plug all amps and PA gear into that.
    

  

### **Option 2 — A Small Internal AC Power Strip**

  

For high-power and multiple devices:

- Mount a **high-quality metal 6-outlet power strip** inside your equipment zone.
    
- Plug piano, guitar amp, mixer, lighting, etc. directly into that.
    

  

Use a **16-amp+ industrial-grade** strip, not a Walmart one.

---

# **✅ 2. IS THE 3,000W INVERTER ENOUGH FOR YOUR FULL CREATIVE RIG?**

  

Here’s what your gear draws:

  

### **🎹 Roland Pro Digital Piano**

  

50–120W max → **easy**

  

### **🎸 Guitar Amp / Line 6**

  

100–300W continuous, maybe **700–1000W surge** → well within capability.

  

### **🗣️ PA System**

- Small/medium: 150–300W
    
- Large powered speakers: 500–1000W each
    
    Even two 1000W powered speakers remain manageable because RMS draw is nowhere near “1000W”.
    

  

### **🔥 TOTAL EXPECTED LOAD**

  

**800–1200W typical**, **1600–2000W peak**.

  

Your inverter:

- **3000W continuous**
    
- **6000W surge**
    

  

This is _perfect_.

You could even run a small **2-channel + stage monitors** setup.

---

# **✅ 3. WHAT ABOUT NOISE? (ELECTRICAL HUM / BUZZ)**

  

Your system is extremely quiet because:

- **Pure sine**
    
- **LiFePO₄ stable voltage**
    
- **No dirty generator AC**
    
- **Low THD**
    

  

Most studios DREAM of having such a clean power source.

---

# **✅ 4. WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT LEVEL OF CAPABILITY?**

  

Now that you have:

- 900Ah LiFePO₄
    
- Victron MPPT 85A
    
- 400–800W solar
    
- DC-DC alternator charger
    
- Shore/gen AC charger
    
- 3000W pure sine inverter
    

  

You already have **FULL Creative / Studio / PA capability**.

  

But here are the _upgrade options_ if you want true pro-level, worldclass capability:

---

## **🔥** 

## **Level 2: Mobile Studio Enhancements**

  

### **①** 

### **Battery Capacity Expansion**

  

You already pulled the trigger — 900Ah is strong.

But if in the next year you added:

- **1200Ah (4 batteries)** or
    
- **1500Ah (5 batteries)**
    

  

…you could run concerts, full worship sets, long-form events, and multi-day retreats without recharge.

  

But 900Ah is **already amazing**.

---

## **🔥** 

## **Level 3: Quiet Stage Lighting (DC and AC)**

  

Add:

- 3–6 **60W LED stage wash lights** (AC)
    
- 12V LED strip backlighting (DC)
    

  

Totally fine on your system.

---

## **🔥** 

## **Level 4: Full Mobile PA / Event Kit**

  

Add:

- One or two **QSC K12.2** or RCF speakers (AC)
    
- Small digital mixer (AC)
    
- Wireless mics (AC)
    
- DI boxes (AC)
    

  

Your system handles all of this without blinking.

---

## **🔥** 

## **Level 5: Surge Protection & Power Conditioning**

  

Two small upgrades:

1. **Furman M-8X2** (AC power conditioner / surge)
    
2. **TrippLite Isobar** (ultra-low noise power strip)
    

  

These protect sensitive studio gear and eliminate noise.

---

## **🔥** 

## **Level 6: Generator pass-through for big outdoor events**

  

If you need to power:

- Full band
    
- Stage lighting
    
- Multiple amps running at once
    
- Large PA stacks
    

  

You can run:

- **Generator → Victron IP22 → Charge batteries → Inverter handles the AC load**
    

  

This gives perfect filtered power even when running a generator.

---

# **🔌 5. HOW YOU WILL PLUG EVERYTHING IN:**

  

**Your AC Distribution:**

  

### **Step 1: Inverter AC terminals → 10/2 w/ ground → AC surface mount box (GFCI recommended)**

  

### **Step 2: AC box has 2–4 outlets**

  

### **Step 3: Plug your:**

- Piano
    
- Guitar amp
    
- Mixer
    
- PA
    
- Lights
    
    directly into that outlet or into a **power conditioner strip**.
    

  

### **Step 4: For phone/laptop USB charging**

  

Use the **OUFFUN 90W USB-C PD panel** on your DC system.

  

This saves inverter time.

---

# **🧭 FINAL ASSESSMENT**

  

You are now effectively building a:

  

**Mobile Creative Studio**

**Mobile PA System**

**Mobile Teaching / Podcast Space**

**Mobile Worship & Ceremony Platform**

**Mobile Command Vehicle**

**Mobile Power Station**

  

Your system is:

- Quiet
    
- Clean
    
- Expandable
    
- Redundant
    
- Mission-ready
    

  

And incredibly — **you reached this level for only ~$600 more than your original build**.

  

This is the correct path.

---

If you want, I’ll now design:

  

### **A fully integrated “Ark Creative Bay” layout**

  

📦 Outlet panel

🎚 Power conditioner

🎤 Mic + mixer zone

🔊 PA mounting location

🎹 Keyboard station

🎛 Cable routing

🔌 AC/DC separation

📱 Device charging hub

📸 Filming / lighting integration

📡 Starlink + communications station

  

Just say **“Build the Ark Creative Bay”**.

Ok - so we could extend battery power... we could extend solar... would we ever need anything more than 3000w sine inverter? Even if we extended out to 1200w solar and 1200ah battery? If we think we might go there to full public concert capabilities anything else we should upsize now?

For your likely path (800–1200 W portable solar, 900–1200 Ah battery, creative/PA focus):

- **Inverter (3000 W)** → already correctly sized. I would _not_ go bigger.
    
- **2/0 battery → inverter cabling** → already appropriate for 3000 W.
    
- **300 A master fuse + 300 A busbar** → also aligned with 3 kW.
    
- **MPPT 150/85** →
    
    - 1200 W @ 12 V ≈ 100 A potential charge
        
    - 85 A MPPT will clip a little in perfect noon sun, but in real conditions (angle, temps, losses) that’s not a big deal. You can:
        
        - Live with mild clipping, or
            
        - Later add a **second small MPPT** and split arrays if you really want to capture every watt.
            
        
    

The **only things I’d “oversize” for future 1200 W / 1200 Ah** are:

1. **Physical layout & cable paths**
    
    - Leave room for **one more battery** and **one more solar suitcase** wiring run.
        
    
2. **Ventilation around the inverter**
    
    - Make sure the 3000 W unit has plenty of airflow so if you hammer it during a concert it stays cool.
        
    
  
You’ve already done the expensive oversizing (Victron class MPPT, 2/0 cabling, 300 A fuse/bus). You do _not_ need to blow up the design further.

##### **4. “Full public concert capabilities” – what would actually push you beyond 3000 W?**
  
You’d have to intentionally move into:

- Dual large subs + multiple mid/high stacks
    
- Fully mic’d drum kit with loud stage volumes
    
- Continuous high-SPL rock show or EDM-style sets from batteries only
    
  
At that point, sane design is:

- **Generator + distro** as primary AC, OR
    
- **Higher-voltage (24/48 V) trailer rig** built specifically for that use.
    
  
For _anything_ under that (small festivals, worship nights, talks for 50–300 people, most band sets), your **3000 W / 6000 W** plus **900–1200 Ah** is more than enough if you’re thoughtful about what runs simultaneously.

____

Final System Audit: 

Here is the **final, full-system audit** — the _last pass_ to ensure that **absolutely nothing is missing** from the Ark’s **ultimate 12V power system**.
  
You have _almost everything_.

There are **8 items** that are either required or strongly recommended for a clean, complete, professional install.
  
I’ll list them as:
  
### **✅** 

### **Everything you already have (confirmed correct)**
  
### **⚠️** 

### **Missing / Required**
  
### **⭐** 

### **Strongly Recommended**

---

---

# **⚠️** 

# **MISSING / REQUIRED (THESE MUST BE ADDED)**
  
### **1. Inverter → AC Transfer / Breaker Panel?**
  
Right now, you’re planning to plug the Furman strip directly into the inverter.
  
That works.

**However**, if you ever want to:

- feed existing outlets
    
- feed the roof AC if needed (rare but possible)
    
- integrate into the bus AC system
    
    …you need:
    

  

👉 **Progressive Dynamics 30A RV AC breaker panel**

(Or similar small AC subpanel)
  
If you do NOT want AC distribution and prefer to remain “portable strip only,” then this is optional.
  
But for a full Ark, I recommend it.

**Note - save for Phase II**

---

### **2. Inverter Remote Switch / Monitoring Panel**
  
The Renogy 3000W supports an external remote panel.
  
You’ll want this near the bed / desk.
  
👉 **Renogy Inverter Remote Switch**

(Confirm compatibility with PUH 3000W)

---

### **3. Battery Interconnect Jumpers (Short 2/0)**

  

You have 10’ battery cable but:

  

**You need 1’–2’ 2/0 jumpers to link the 3 batteries together.**

  

Your 10’ cable should NOT be cut — it’s for long runs (battery → busbar → inverter).

  

You need:

  

👉 **Three 1–2ft 2/0 AWG copper jumpers**

(pre-crimped, 3/8” lugs)

---

### **4. Large 5/16” Lugs for Bus Bars (2/0 gauge)**

  

Your existing 2/0 lugs are **3/8”**.

Some bus bars use **5/16”** studs.

  

Verify your DaierTek bus bars:

They use **5/16” studs**.

  

So you need:

  

👉 **2/0 AWG 5/16” lugs** (8–10 pieces)

  

Your 3/8” lugs will NOT fit on the bus bar studs.

---

### **5. Heat Shrink for 2/0 gauge (large diameter)**

  

Your kits include heat shrink for 8AWG and smaller.

  

2/0 lugs need **large diameter** shrink tubing.

  

👉 **3:1 adhesive-lined heat shrink – 1 inch diameter**

---

### **6. Battery Terminal Cover / Linking Bar Protection**

  

You have boots for the terminals – good.

  

But you need:

  

👉 **3 battery terminal adhesive anti-shock pads**

OR

👉 **Battery-to-battery jumper boot covers**

  

This prevents accidental contact when installing or removing batteries.

---

### **7. Grounding System**

  

You need:

  

✔ 4 AWG or 2 AWG wire (10–15 ft)

✔ Ring terminals

✔ Ground bolt

✔ Star washers

✔ Dielectric grease

  

This bonds:

- Inverter chassis → vehicle chassis
    
- Busbar negative → vehicle chassis
    
- DC fuse block negative → chassis
    
- Battery negative → chassis (optional but recommended)
    

  

**This is required for safety and inverter performance.**

---

### **8. Main Battery Disconnect Switch**

  

You will absolutely want a master shut-off switch.

  

👉 **Blue Sea 6006 or 6007 battery disconnect**

Rated 300A continuous.

  

This goes between the battery and the master fuse.

---

# **⭐ STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY VALUABLE)**

  

### **9. Solar Suitcase Protective Cases**

  

You have two expensive 400W suitcases.

  

Protect them during transit.

  

👉 Renogy soft case (if available)

or

👉 Pelican 1700 series rifle case (fits perfectly with foam removed)

---

### **10. AC outlet expansion (hardware-mountable)**

  

If you want a clean mount:

  

👉 **MICTUNING 4-Outlet RV AC Panel** (flush mount)

  

This avoids using a loose strip if you want permanent AC outlets.

---

### **11. 12V “cigarette” socket panel**

  

For air pumps, small 12V accessories, etc.

  

👉 **Blue Sea 1011 12V Socket Panel**





## Sound 

Below is a complete, integrated **Ark Sound Protocol**—a structured approach to how sound is chosen, deployed, transmitted, and wielded within the Ark for the flourishing of life, spirit, and community.

  

This is not merely a playlist strategy.

  

It is an **energetic architecture**.

  

A **sonic rite of passage**.

  

A **daily and seasonal rhythm**.

  

A **tool for the elevation of consciousness, morale, unity, and momentum**.

  

Use it intentionally and it becomes transformative.

  

Use it casually and it simply becomes pleasant.

---

# **THE ARK SOUND PROTOCOL**

  

_A comprehensive sonic architecture for Presence, Purpose, and Power_

---

# **I.** 

# **The Purpose of Sound on the Ark**

  

Sound exists onboard the Ark to:

1. **Shape the internal field**
    
2. **Stabilize the nervous system**
    
3. **Prepare consciousness for elevation**
    
4. **Cultivate beauty and joy**
    
5. **Strengthen community**
    
6. **Sanctify presence**
    
7. **Empower creative practice**
    
8. **Transmit narrative**
    
9. **Lift spirits in hard moments**
    
10. **Unify collective attention**
    

  

Sound is a **total environmental artform**, not entertainment.

  

Sound is the architecture of mood, thought, and destiny.

---

# **II.** 

# **The Four Sonic Fields**

  

Every moment aboard the Ark is inside one of four sonic fields:

  

### **1. Silence**

  

The primordial field

Where perception refines

And consciousness descends deeper

  

Silence is deliberate.

Never accidental.

Never empty.

  

It is the highest octave.

  

**Use often.**

---

### **2. Atmosphere**

  

Low volume, continuous environment

Enhances mood, comfort, grounding

  

Examples:

- Ambient
    
- Instrumental
    
- Nature sounds
    
- Gregorian
    
- Celtic
    
- Japanese ambient
    
- Zen garden
    
- Piano nocturnes
    
- Tibetan bowls
    

  

Target volume: **18–30%**

  

Purpose:

Peace, presence, serenity

---

### **3. Focus**

  

Intentional sonic shaping for cognitive work

  

Examples:

- Binaural theta or alpha
    
- No-lyric instrumental downtempo
    
- “Deep focus”
    
- 432Hz meditative soundscapes
    

  

Target volume: **22–35%**

  

Purpose:

Deep concentration, clarity, flow

---

### **4. Transmission**

  

This is the highest functional category.

  

Examples:

- Ceremony
    
- Guided ritual
    
- Performance
    
- Speech
    
- Teaching
    
- Song
    
- Poetry
    
- Live instrument
    
- Collective singing
    
- Celebration
    
- Benediction
    

  

Volume varies

but presence is **total**.

  

Purpose:

Unification

Revelation

Elevation

---

# **III.** 

# **Daily Rhythm Pattern**

  

**Launch Sequence**

→ wake in silence

→ prayer/breathing

→ soft ambient

→ grounding

  

**Daytime Mode**

→ rotates between focus + silence

  

**Evening Descent**

→ soft beauty

→ gratitude

→ gentle closure

  

**Nightfall**

→ deep silence

→ if needed, calming ambient at low volume

---

# **IV.** 

# **The Seven Archetypal Modes of Sound**

  

Use consciously:

  

### **1.** 

### **Sanctuary Mode**

  

Quiet, reflective, intimate

  

### **2.** 

### **Workshop Mode**

  

Focused, purposeful, productive

  

### **3.** 

### **Creative Forge Mode**

  

Inspired, energized, uplifting

  

### **4.** 

### **Celebration Mode**

  

Joyful, spirited, communal

  

### **5.** 

### **Ceremonial Mode**

  

Sacred, reverent, intentional

  

### **6.** 

### **Transmission Mode**

  

Teaching, storytelling, conveying purpose

  

### **7.** 

### **Tribe Mode**

  

Collective singing

Call-and-response

Drums

Unity rhythm

---

# **V.** 

# **Volume Protocol**

  

Default Rule:

**Volume must serve awareness, not eclipse it.**

  

Guideline:

- 0–20% → sanctuary / night
    
- 18–30% → atmosphere
    
- 22–35% → focus
    
- 35–60% → creative forge
    
- 60–85% → ceremony, celebration
    
- 85–100% → **only outdoors, never inside**
    

  

Inside the Ark, >65% is almost never right.

  

Let the Ark breathe.

---

# **VI.** 

# **The Sacred Audio Crates**

  

**Every audio system needs curated crates.**

  

Prepare, name, and maintain:

- Dawn
    
- Mid-Morning Focus
    
- Afternoon Flow
    
- Evening Softness
    
- Sacred Silence
    
- Inner Temple
    
- Rain Ritual
    
- Cosmic Wonder
    
- Overcome
    
- Celebration
    
- Dance
    
- Anthem
    
- Farewell
    
- Long Night Journey
    

  

This creates continuity.

  

This creates recurrence.

  

This creates meaning.

---

# **VII.** 

# **Correct Use of the EVERSE**

  

### **Indoors:**

- 25–40% for ambient
    
- 35–60% for performance
    
- corner placement angled diagonally
    
- avoid centerline beam
    

  

### **Outdoors:**

- 50–100%
    
- tilt upward slightly
    
- anchor base for wind resistance
    
- battery mode preferred
    

  

### **Never:**

- aim directly at one person
    
- run near ventilation intake
    

---

# **VIII.** 

# **Transmission Protocol**

  

(when actually transmitting)

1. Clear space
    
2. Eliminate distractions
    
3. Choose mode
    
4. Invoke intention silently
    
5. Breathe three times
    
6. Begin gently
    
7. Allow crescendo only if necessary
    
8. End softly
    
9. Return to silence
    

  

The silence after matters as much as the sound.

---

# **IX.** 

# **How To Know What To Play**

  

Ask:

  

“What is the energy needed now?”

  

Not…

“What do I want to hear?”

---

# **X.** 

# **The Two Most Important Laws**

  

**1. Never let sound be habitual.**

Habits dull power.

  

**2. Always leave space for silence.**

Silence renews power.

---

# **XI.** 

# **The Highest Use**

  

When the Ark becomes…

  

a resonant instrument

of spirit

alignment

presence

ceremony

creativity

and communion

  

Sound ceases to be background

  

and becomes a force.

---

# **XII.** 

# **Finally—The Essence**

  

At its highest level:

  

**Sound is prayer.**

  

And the Ark is a temple on wheels.

  

When wielded intentionally,

the Ark becomes a moving sanctuary of elevation, unity, and awakening.

  

When wielded unconsciously,

sound becomes noise.

  

Choose the former.

  

And watch it transform everything.

---

If you’re ready…

  

we can now design:

  

**The Ark Sacred Sound Library**

- full structure
    
- categories
    
- genres
    
- curated lists
    
- artist recommendations
    
- ceremonial tracks
    
- nighttime tracks
    
- morning tracks
    
- focus tracks
    

  

Just say the word.

### Aesthetics  

### Refrigeration 

Most _perishable dependency_ in modern life comes from

- Fresh meat 
- Dairy 
- Certain vegetables  
  
In wilderness + roving life 

- Root vegetables keep months without refrigeration 
- Grains, legumes, nuts, dried fruits, jerky, salted meat keep indefinitely  
- Ferments replace refrigeration  
- Seasonality reduces dependency  
  
The sovereign choice: 
12V DC Chest Refrigerator / Freezer  
Either Danfoss or Secop Compressor  
Chest Style (not upright)  
Top-opening (cold stays in) 
Runs directly on 12V DC

Primary Recommendation: 
- ICECO VL60 Dual Zone  
	- [Nomadic Supply Co Link](https://nomadicsupply.com/iceco-vl60-63-4qt-dual-zone-portable-refrigerator-freezer-w-insulated-cover/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21912047719&gbraid=0AAAAABNepRg3rC7-hzN1fDDP0rpgdM_Qe&gclid=CjwKCAiAw9vIBhBBEiwAraSATlT6j0mTsObLoTthRObqicGee7UUx3nECrYr8ztoCkS-e_EX1nuf2BoCHswQAvD_BwE)
Fridge + Freezer simultaneously  
Durable. Repairable.

Winter optimization: 

- In your region (Idaho mountains):
- For 5–6 months of the year, the outside air IS your refrigeration.
- You will have an insulated passive **Cold Box** built into the bus structure.
- Sealed cabinet against the bus wall 
- With a screened exterior vent with adjustable opening 
- For root vegetables, apples, carrots, cheese, and ferments. 
• • To store meat from seasonal hunt, add second identical ICECO VL60 and leave it off 9 months off the year..

### Insulation

### Phase III: Deep Clean 

1. ✅Deep clean  
	1. Remove and clean loose shelves  
	2. Wipe roof and walls  
	3. Wipe all counters and surfaces  
	4. Sweep and vacuum  
	5. Remove any mold (white vinegar + sunlight + airflow)
2. Carpet Clean  
3. Smudge / incense / sacred decor / prayer / intention setting

### Phase IV: Listening, Landing, and Survivability  

Concept: Move in lightly, like camping. Experience and feel the space for at least week or two before making significant changes and investments. 

For survivability in the cold idaho winters, we can: 
- Sleep on a raised platform with pad (2x6 cedar slats over existing wheel well box ledge = tatami)  
	- Foldable tatami mats for day. 
	- Pad for night (futon, topper, camper mattress)
	- One cotton / linen sheet 
	- 1” thick natural Wool blanket…  
	- Down comforter if available  
	- 76" x 53" ≈ Full XL  
- Drink via Berkey or spring water  
- Eat simple meals via basic camp stove, dutch oven, simple cookware  
- Wash via 5 gal water jug with spigot + 2 bowls + towel  
- Use a biodegradable lined bucket toilet with sawdust  
- Light via 2700k LED lanterns, headlamp, flashlight  
- Beeswax candles  
- Simple journal + pen  
- Heat via diesel or propane heater    
- Lay temporary floor covering? (wool mats?)  
- Power - Slow build, LiFeP04 bank, inverter, possible solar after usage study  
- Temperature and Humidity Monitor (non-electric)  
- Collapsable shower / wash station???  
- Wheel chock for bus spare  
- Crackable vent at highest point  

| **Purpose**    | **Solution**                                   | **Why**                                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heat (Initial) | **Propane Heater**                             | Safe, adjustable, zero build commitment                           |
| Sleep          | **Therm-a-Rest BaseCamp pad** or thick foam    | Gives data about bed height, width, and comfort before building   |
| ✅ Water        | **5–7 gallon Aquatainer + enamel dish basin**  | Lets you live, wash dishes, wash hands, no plumbing installed yet |
| ✅ Cooking      | **Simple 2 burner butane/propane camp stove**  | Ultra clean, zero install.                                        |
| Lighting       | **USB LED strip lights + small power station** | Avoid using bus wiring until evaluated                            |
| Toilet         | **Luggable Loo + sawdust + compost bags**      | No build commitment; try rhythm before buying Nature’s Head       |
| Warmth         | **Two wool blankets + one down comforter**     | Efficient warmth for sub-freezing nights                          |

## Phase V: 6 Month Basic Livability  

- MindWeaving / Dialogue / Communion Space  
- Art / Whiteboard / Canvas / Paper space (collapsible easel?)  
- Art supplies 
- Seal and weatherproof both doors  
- Heat sizing note: 
	- For ~200–230 sq ft and so-so insulation at −10 °F, 18–25 kBTU/h keeps you comfortable. The diesel + mini-stove combo covers that with redundancy.
- Wood stove (Grizzly)  
	- With proper shields, hearth, and outside air kit  
- Tertiary heat - existing duct / under-shelf heater as a boost when driving or on shore / generator 
- Destratify air - two quiet 12 V fans moving ceiling heat down the aisle.
- **Pantry wall** Deep shelves + lip bars No rattles, no spillage  
- **Heat shielding** (calcium silicate board + steel)
- **Window + roof venting baffles** $50–$150 Controls moisture + smoke draw
- **Condensation control** (Reflectix strategic baffles, not full coverage) $40–$120 Only on specific cold surfaces
- Add a **balanced fresh-air trickle** (small floor intake near stove + roof vent cracked). 
- Plumb **outside combustion air** to wood stove. 
- **Boot/drying zone near stove** Tile board + hooks Critical in winter environments
- Removable / modular thermal curtain zoning  
- Treat rust  

#### Water 
- 40 to 60 gallon interior water tank  
- Foot pump to basin sink  
- Basin sink   
- Copper or pex drain to grey jug  
- Grey jug  
- Foot pump + copper (or pex?) drain to grey jug  
- Flooring 
	- Cedar or Pine?  
	- Cork or wool?  
- Ceiling  
- Have a compact **desiccant or compressor dehumidifier** for cooking/drying cycles.
	- maintain relative humidity **RH ~35–45%** in winter.
	- Drying line near the stove; wipe window/metal dew in morning.

#### Power 

1. **100Ah LiFePO4 battery** ($250–$350)

2. **1500W pure sine inverter** ($180–$240)

3. **USB + 12V LED lighting** ($30–$90)

4. After living in it 2–4 weeks → **Size solar based on real usage**, not guesses.

Possible End State A: 
- 400aH LiFePO4  
- 800W Solar  
- Charger from shore, generator, or DC-DC charger (roof solar optional later)

• Keep the **50 A shore inlet + transfer** and the **Onan**. Great for workshops/hard loads.
• Convert overhead lights to **LED ballast-bypass tubes**; kill old fluorescents. (or eliminate metal frame entirely to open up the space)

Add GFCI outlets to galley and garage if not already present. 

#### Rear Lift → Gear & Logistics Bay 

- Waterproof gear lockers (fuel, oil, chains, recovery supplies)  
- Fold out work surface (field maintenance station) (indoor? outdoor? both?)


#### Motorcycle?  

- Wheel chock and tie downs  


| **Purpose** | **Solution** | **Why** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Heat        |              |         |
| Sleep       |              |         |
| Water       |              |         |
| Cooking     |              |         |
| Lighting    |              |         |
| Toilet      |              |         |
| Warmth      |              |         |
