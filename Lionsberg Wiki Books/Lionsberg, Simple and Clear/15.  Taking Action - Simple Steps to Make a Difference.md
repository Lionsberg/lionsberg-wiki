# 15.  Taking Action - Simple Steps to Make a Difference

While confronting the Meta Crisis and working towards a better future may seem overwhelming at times, it's important to remember that each of us has the power to make a transformational difference in our lives and our world. By developing a [[Vision]] and taking simple, concrete steps in our own lives, we can each contribute individually and locally to our collective effort to overcome the Meta Crisis and co-create the New World. Here are some suggestions to help you get started:

### 1. Educate Yourself

Learn about the [[Meta Crisis]], the [[New Vision and Plan]], and the [[Lionsberg System and Approach]]. Understand the interconnectedness of the issues we face and the importance of addressing them holistically in community. Stay informed, curious, and open to new ideas and perspectives and ideas as you learn and grow. For a starting point, [[Read The Books]]. 

### 2. Embrace the Values

Internalize and embody the shared values of [[Truth]], [[Love]], [[Justice]], [[Stewardship]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Liberty]]. Use these values as a [[Compass]] to guide your actions, decisions, and interactions with others as you [[Navigate]] towards [[The Goal]].

### 3. Connect with Others

Join or create local or global groups on the [[Lionsberg Platform]] focused on addressing the Meta Crisis and co-creating the New World. Share your knowledge, skills, and passion with others, and collaborate on meaningful projects and initiatives that contribute to the collective effort. See [[Forge or Join a Group]], and [[Join The Platform]]. 

### 4. Support Local and Regenerative Initiatives

Make an effort to support local businesses, cooperatives, and initiatives that prioritize regenerativity, socioeconomic justice, and holistic community wellbeing. This can include buying from local farmers, supporting ethical companies, participating in community projects, and removing your time, attention, and resources from organizations and activities that are antithetical to [[The Goal]].

### 5. Transform Your Environmental Footprint

Evaluate your own lifestyle, consumption, and work habits, and seek ways to transform your environmental impact from extractive to regenerative. This can include conserving energy, reducing waste, eating a more plant-based diet, using sustainable transportation options, and directing your capacity, attention, and work towards organizations, initiatives, and causes that are meaningfully contributing to the regenerative capacity of our society and our planet.

### 6. Practice Love, Compassion and Empathy

Cultivate Love, empathy and compassion for others and all Creation, regardless of their background, beliefs, or circumstances. Seek to understand other perspectives and experiences, and treat all creatures with the kindness and respect their Divine Beginning deserves. 

### 7. Share Your Story and Spread the Word

Share your own story, experiences and insights related to the Meta Crisis, the New Vision and Plan, and the Lionsberg System and Approach with others. [[Spread The Word]], and use your unique voice and relationships to inspire and engage others in the collective effort to co-create a better world. 

### 8. Engage in Advocacy and Activism

Get involved in positive and transformational activism, and use your voice to advocate for policies and initiatives that address the [[Root Causes]] of the Meta Crisis and promote a just, regenerative, and flourishing world. Participate in peaceful protests, sign petitions, organize alliances, run for office, or contact your elected representatives to express your concerns and support for positive change that aligns with the [[New Vision and Plan]]. 

### 9. Foster Personal Growth and Development

Invest in your own personal transformational growth and development by cultivating a growth mindset, nurturing your physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual wellbeing, and seeking out opportunities to learn, grow, and build your capacity. In the face of a complex and unpredictable [[Meta Crisis]], we need to build as much individual, local, and global strength and capacity as we possibly come, so that we can confront and overcome whatever comes our way. 

### 10. Learn to Play The Great Game 

Learn to play the [[The Great Game of LIONSBERG]], and track and measure how your life and your world begin to transform around you as advance on [[Your Quest]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

### 11. Be the Change

Strive to be a living example of the [[Values]] and [[Principles]] outlined in the [[Lionsberg Manifesto]] and the [[New Vision and Plan]]. Remember that change starts with each of us, and by [[Embodying]] the change we wish to see in the world, we can inspire others to join us in the [[Quest]] towards a [[Brighter Future]]. 

By taking these simple steps, you can make a meaningful difference in your own life and the lives of others. As we all work together to confront and overcome the Meta Crisis, we can co-create a more just, regenerative, and flourishing world for all.
