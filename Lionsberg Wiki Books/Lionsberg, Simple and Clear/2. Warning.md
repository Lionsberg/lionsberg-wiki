# 2. Warning

Thinking through these issues can be deeply triggering. 

We understand. 

But there is more within you than you can possibly know, and the only way to deal with that which discomforts us is to face it. 

We extend our love, compassion, and appreciation to all citizens who are engaged in our shared effort to co-create a just, regenerative, prosperous, and flourishing world for all. We acknowledge the hurt, traumas, abuses, fears and divisions of our individual and collective past, and we encourage every participant to humbly, openly, and compassionately work together to design and build [[The Future]] we all long for.
