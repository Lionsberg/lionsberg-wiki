By learning from and incorporating Indigenous wisdom into our understanding of the world, we can foster a more sustainable, regenerative, and just society that values the interexistence of the Earth and all its inhabitants, and rightly relates to Spirit that creates and sustains Life. 

### Lessons from History

Throughout history, humanity has faced countless challenges, often emerging stronger and more resilient as a result.

Through the power of our creativity, our connections, and our Divine Inspiration, we collectively have access to every solution and potential needed to not only survive, but flourish  together in unprecedented ways in the coming era. 

By drawing upon these diverse perspectives and learning from the wisdom and experiences of others, we can nurture hope and resilience in our shared journey towards the New World.
