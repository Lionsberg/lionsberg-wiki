# Alignment Of The Lionsberg System With Biblical Principles And Values

The Lionsberg System is founded on a set of universal values and principles that are intended to guide behavior and decision making within the community. These values are inspired by and align with biblical principles and values, and are intended to foster a culture of trust, transparency, and accountability.

The vision of Lionsberg, to co-create a world in which all people have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, and in which the natural environment is regenerated and restored for future generations, is aligned with biblical teachings such as the belief in the inherent worth and dignity of all people created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and the call to be stewards of the earth and its resources (Genesis 2:15).

The mission of Lionsberg, to build a new kind of system that aligns and mobilizes the collective resources, expertise, and creativity of people around the world towards a shared Purpose, Vision, and Goal aligns with biblical principles such as the commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself (Matthew 22:39),  the power of community and collaboration exemplified in the early church (Acts 2:42-47). As a system purpose-built to empower humanity to enact and embody the will and intention of God, it is also a direct manifestation of the commandment to seek first the Kingdom of God (Matthew 6:33). 

The guiding values of Lionsberg, including truth, love, justice, stewardship, and wisdom, align with biblical principles and values such as the pursuit of wisdom and truth (Proverbs 23:23) and the call to do justice (Isaiah 1:17). The value of love, at the core of the Lionsberg System, aligns with Jesus' commandment to love one another (John 13:34) and the biblical understanding of love as the highest virtue (1 Corinthians 13:13), and the nature of God (1 John 4:8). 

The goals of Lionsberg, including the promotion of individual and collective wellbeing and development, the fostering of sustainable and regenerative communities and systems, and the creation of a world in which all people have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential, align with biblical themes of individual and collective transformation, shalom, flourishing, and the Kingdom of God.

In terms of embodiment of the biblical mandate to do what Jesus would do and be perfect as God is perfect, the Lionsberg System aims to be a living example of Jesus' call to love one's neighbor as oneself (Matthew 22:39), to seek first the Kingdom of God (Matthew 6:33), and to meet the pragmatic physical and spiritual needs of those around us (James 2:14-17). By bringing together individuals, organizations, and communities from all corners of the globe to love, serve, and work together towards a shared purpose, the Lionsberg System encourages its members to put the needs of others before their own and to work towards the common good. In this way, the Lionsberg System aims to be a pragmatic and embodied reflection of the selfless love and perfect goodness of God.

Throughout the Bible, there are numerous passages and themes that relate to the issues and challenges addressed by the Lionsberg System. These include the call to love and serve others (Matthew 25:35-40), the importance of caring for the poor and marginalized (Isaiah 58:6-7), and the responsibility to be good stewards of the earth (Genesis 1:26).

In summary, the Lionsberg System is deeply aligned with biblical principles and values, and is founded on a commitment to creating a world in which all people and all creatures have the opportunity to reach their full potential and flourish in harmony, in accordance with God's lovingkindness and desire for shalom.
