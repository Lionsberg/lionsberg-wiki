# Introduction - Lionsberg - A Biblical Perspective

Esteemed brothers and sisters, fellow children of God, following the footsteps of Jesus,

I have been sharing a vision for a comprehensive approach to working together to solve the grand challenges and accomplish the global goals. This is a vision of a movement animated by the Spirit, Wisdom, and Knowledge of God, rooted in biblical principles and values, and desperately needed in our world today. It is a movement whose aim is to bring about comprehensive societal transformation through the power of the Spirit of God. It is a movement whose outcome is to vanquish the oppression, deceit, corruption, and injustice sinking its talons into our world, in order to establish a flourishing, safe, and abundant future for the entire family of God. 

As we have shared this vision, some religious conservatives have been alarmed, even going so far as to accuse us of operating in league with Satan, or attempting to institute a one-world totalitarian government. While this is a predictable response (even Jesus was accused of being in league with Satan), it is unfortunate and must be forthrightly addressed.

As Christians, we are called to be imitators of God and to do what Jesus would do. This means conforming our minds and actions to God's will and intention, and praying and working to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven. But too often, we shy away from this call, believing that it is only through the return of Jesus that true transformation can occur. We limit ourselves to individual and local acts of charity and leave the larger problems of society and the issues of true transformational justice untouched, waiting for politicians or Jesus to solve them. Or we limit our efforts to transform the world, believing that it is inevitably failing and corrupted, and that our only real obligation is to save our souls and the souls of others as we wait for the rapture or armageddon. 

My understanding is that this is a terrible misunderstanding of what it means to be imitators of God. It is not enough to simply pray for God's Kingdom to come; we must actively work to bring it about. If we are not doing what God would do to create and sustain our world, we are not conforming our selves to the image of our Creator and Sustainer. Nearly all Christians agree that we are called to be the “hands and feet” of God on earth, doing what God would do and working to bring about a better and eternally regenerative future for all. If this were not so, Jesus would not have prayed for us to be one as he and the Father are one, or prophesied that through the presence and power of the Spirit alive within us we would go on to do even greater things than he did.

When society is on the brink of comprehensive failure, comprehensive transformative action is required. No one who has an ounce of Love in their hearts would desire for the innocent children and creatures of the world to undergo the collapse into chaos that appears to lie at the end of our current trajectory. When the heart of love sees danger and suffering ahead, it rushes powerfully to the aid of the one it loves. It is the essence of masculine courage that rushes to battle. It is the essence of feminine power that miraculously lifts cars up off their children. When faced with the prospect of absolute chaos, catastrophe, and collapse, what does the Spirit of God do? What does God do in the face of chaos and darkness? What should we do in the face of chaos, darkness, and suffering? 

The Spirit of God is that which rises up and hovers over the waters of chaos and darkness, and speaks the Logos that brings forth the new order that is Good. It the conscious force that mediates between the infinite potential of chaos, and the habitable structure of order. It is that which is able to overcome the chaos and darkness in order to bring forth the Divinely created order that is good.

In this booklet, we lay our a comprehensive biblical defense of the Lionsberg System and Approach, including why we believe it is in exact alignment with what God, Jesus, and all the prophets have instructed us to do. 

We make a case that it is actually the duty and responsibility of Christians to work towards a better society and world as a whole, and that in the face of a Meta Crisis threatening all life and society as we know it, an integrated and comprehensive solution and approach is not only biblical, but an absolute ethical and moral imperative.
