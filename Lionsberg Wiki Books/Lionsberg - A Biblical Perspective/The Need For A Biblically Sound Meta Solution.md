# The Need For A Biblically Sound Meta Solution

The complexity and scale of the Meta Crisis means that we cannot fully map, model, or understand it from a scientific and secular perspective alone. In order to effectively address the Meta Crisis, we must also consider the eternal spiritual wisdom and insights found in scripture, and consider the perspective it offers on the core human condition, and the guidelines for how human society can flourish in right relationship with the Creator and all creation across the millennia. 

While some Christians might argue that the situation is hopeless until the Jesus returns, we believe that the fullness of the counsel of scripture makes it abundantly clear that when "the master returns", we are to be found by him to be doing what He would have done. "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?Â It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions" (Luke 24:45). If we are to be faithful good stewards of the families, resources, communities, and nations God has entrusted us with, we must be doing with them what God would have them done, which means progressively conforming them to His perfect will and intention. 

As we seek to address the Meta Crisis, it is important to consider the role of faith and spirituality in finding solutions, and to ensure that the solutions we consider align with, and do not contradict the full wisdom and guidance of scripture and the discernment given by the Spirit of God within us. 

A wise solution should not only harmonize with and align with the eternal wisdom of the bible, but also reconcile and align our current best understanding and capabilities relative to governance, economy, technology, and society in our current time and space. 

One important principle that emerges from a Biblically sound approach to the Meta Crisis is the importance of caring for the earth and its inhabitants. The Bible emphasizes the value and worth of all living beings, and calls on us to be good stewards of the earth and its resources. This means considering the impacts of our actions on the natural world and all its inhabitants, starting with the weakest, most vulnerable, and most voiceless, and working towards solutions that promote eternal regenerative capacity and care for the earth. 

Another principle that emerges from a Biblically sound approach is the value of community and cooperation. The Bible emphasizes the importance of loving our neighbors and working together towards the common good. In the face of the Meta Crisis, this means considering the impacts of our actions on others, and working towards solutions that promote true justice and equality of intrinsic worth and opportunity for all. 

A Biblically sound approach to the Meta Crisis also emphasizes the importance of personal and social transformation. The Bible calls on us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds, and to work towards a just and righteous society. In the face of the Meta Crisis, this means considering the root causes of suffering and injustice, and working towards solutions that address these issues at their source through personal and social transformation in partnership with the Spirit of God. 

A Biblically sound approach must also look at the entirety of all tribes, nations, and ecosystems in all places and all times, which is the eternal and universal perspective of God. It must then equip and empower all people and all creatures, in all places and all times, to flourish together in wisdom, harmony, and right relationship with God and one another, while avoiding the warning, traps, and pitfalls that human beings so often fall into. 

Lastly, a Biblically sound approach must humbly recognize the ultimate Supremacy of God, and avoid becoming a totalitarian "Tower of Babel" by ensuring that the human "tribe of tribes" is aligned and rightly related to God as its central organizing relationship, and not to any human structure. 

Overall, a Biblically sound Meta Solution must consider the interconnectedness of the challenges we face, and work towards comprehensive, integrated, and adaptable solutions that prioritize the well-being of all living beings, promote compassion and justice, and support personal and social transformation. It must also recognize the value of spiritual wisdom in understanding and addressing the Meta Crisis, and empower individuals and communities to locally enact wise solutions that harmonize nature and society.

Having failed to identify such a solution here in our modern time and place, we believe it is our responsibility to partner with God and one another to co-create one.
