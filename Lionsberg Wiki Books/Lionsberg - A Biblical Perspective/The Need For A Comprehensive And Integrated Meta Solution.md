# The Need For A Comprehensive And Integrated Meta Solution

As we have established, the existing systems and approaches to addressing the Meta Crisis are failing to effectively address the complex and interconnected challenges we face. It is clear that we need a [[New]] approach to addressing these issues, one that is wise, comprehensive, integrated, and adaptable.

A comprehensive approach is necessary to address the full range of issues that contribute to the Meta Crisis. This includes social, economic, environmental, governmental, and spiritual issues, as well as the intersections and interdependencies between these elements of the Whole. A comprehensive approach must also consider the impacts of each of these systematic issues on the human and living systems that are affected by them. This means considering the interdependent relationships between different issues, systems, and sectors, and how they impact, inform, and transform one another. 

An adaptable approach is necessary to effectively navigate the complexity and dynamic nature of the Meta Crisis. Because we are attempting to intervene in complex systems that are beyond our ability to understand or control, this means being open to new ideas and approaches, embracing and facilitating emergence, and being willing to adapt and adjust as circumstances change and new issues and opportunities present themselves. 

A comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing the Meta Crisis must also prioritize long-term regenerative capacity, liberty and justice for all, and the well-being of both human and living systems. This means considering the impacts of our actions on all current and future generations of life, and ensuring that every solution and intervention is wise, just, and good for all.

Only through a comprehensive, integrated, and adaptable approach can we hope to effectively address the root causes of the Meta Crisis, and work towards a future that is flourishing, sustainable, and abundant for all.
