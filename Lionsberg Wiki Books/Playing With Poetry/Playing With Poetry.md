# Playing With Poetry 

## 1. 

I am frozen in Time, drifting in Space  

A world swirls and roils  

The Foundations crack  

Society crumbles  

As The Building groans and falls  

The People sleep to death   

_______________
## 2. 

Insanity infiltrates, [[Chaos]] emerges  

Through the cracks in The Walls of the Order, [[The Serpent]] slithers in

## 3. 

How do you awaken the sleeping?  

How do you raise the dead before they die?

Listen to The Voice, crying out in The Wilderness  

It is your Salvation, longing to be heard

Over the centuries We built, and from the ashes of Darkness, Society emerged  

Then, one long dark night, it was all gone  

We awoke, and the sun did not rise over the Experiment  

Darkness covered the Earth  

While We slept, The Thief had come and stolen Our Inheritance

And so it came to pass that it wasn't

The first time We were pushed towards it, we could not see the cliff  

So We backed up a step, and reset, in shock   

Push by push, day by day, little by little  

We backed up, and reset  

But We did not resist  

Why were they pushing Us like this?  

Then one day they pushed, and We backed up again  

And plummeted down towards ruin  

As We fell, the heights We formerly possessed slowly receded from view  

And then finally, it went Dark  

The Curtain closed on millennia of work  

We were once again free, but Our children were enslaved in depths above

What kind of Art might the blind See?  

What kind of Sound might the deaf Hear?  

What kind of Sensation might the numb Feel?  

What kind of Light might the unconscious Perceive?

## 9. 

It is easy to find microsuccesses on the pathway towards ruin  

Little by little, We are encouraged on in the wrong direction  

Step by step, We approach the Abyss  

We faithfully progress towards the wrong milestones  

Not realizing that they mark the way towards Death

## 10. 

Why do you seem so desperate? Why are you flailing your arms?

Be quiet, so that we can go back to Sleep  

Close the blinds, so that we don't have to See  

Shut the door, so that we don't have to Hear  

Medicate us, so that we don't have to Feel  

Comfortable in the numbing pain of their mild suffering  

They roll over, and go back to Sleep in the burning building  

Unaware it will cost them their lives

The world is certain  

The world is wise  

The world has its plan  

Suddenly, but not without warning, Reality shatters the illusion

It is lonely in The Wilderness.

[[Beyond The Boundary]], the cold wind sweeps away the words before they can be heard  

_________________________
## 13. 

Society mocks and scorns  

The Old Leaders gnash their teeth, hatch their schemes, and threaten hell  

Meanwhile, the Prophets speak on  

_________________________
## 14. 
  
The Arrogant Ignorant celebrate their righteousness  

From their pulpits and cages they mock the Free  

Bound in their chains, they are comfortable and secure in their false salvation  

Day by day, their living hell enroaches

_"The building is on fire, and our room is getting smoky..._

_...Quick, let us move to the next room, so that we can comfortably resume our slumber."_

The foundations wither under the heat  

The supporting beams prepare their collapse  

And the Fire ushers in the reign of [[Chaos]].

## 16. 

Evil has gripped the steering wheel of the vessel of Society  

Its guards stand watch on the bridge  

Its agents roam the decks and cabins and minds  

Cutting the tongues off of those who dare to Speak  

Severing the hands of those who dare to Write  

And removing the heads of those who dare to Stand  

The people cower in fear, forgetting that United they are Free, and Freedom is not

___
## 20. 

*"Chop the wood, carry the water, mend the fence"* they say  

Do they not see The Tsunami on the horizon?  

Heads down, they diligently and responsibly labored, never looking up  

Until The Flood came and swept them all away  

_____
## 21. 

When will they understand that prophetic words are lovingly spoken  

So that the prophesies do not have to come to pass?

They warn of the roads we do not have to tread  

___
## 22. 

Our ruin is certain  

Generations of suffering inevitably at hand  

Hopelessness and despair is our lot  

**UNLESS**...  

_____
## 23. 

*"The building is on fire and the stairways are blocked, quick, this Way to **The Exit**!"*

They marveled at the arrogance of one speaking with authority  

They mocked him, they beat him, and they left him for dead  

And so they perished in The Flames  

____

______
## 26. 

As the shaking grew stronger and the explosions grew louder  

The people rushed through the streets  

Beset by false prophets and proclamations of doom  

The herds were driven into their pens  

The gates clicked shut and the monsters howled in celebration  

As the blood of sacrifice began to flow  

The demons whirled in frenzy as The Dark Feast began   

Humanity now permanently on the menu  

_____
## 27. 

As the End of the Old Order drew near  

The Sane became pariahs  

The Truthful became outcasts  

The Clean became disgusting  

The Wise became abhorrent  

The Light became disturbing  

They were rounded up and exterminated  

And for generations society was free  

From the affliction of Wisdom, Truth, and Justice. 

As the Light receded the Parasites rejoiced   

Finally able to flourish in the Darkness blinding their hosts  

____
## 28. 

To write the Words that no one may read  

To speak the Words that no one may hear   

To sing the Songs that no one may know  

To make the Art that no one may see  

To walk the Path that no one may find  

To offer a Way that no one may seek  

To utter the Warnings that no one may heed  

To be Loved by few  

To be betrayed by many  

To be rejected and alone  

One who walks in this Way can only be sustained by the Source Within     

Living or dying for eternity  

Conquering the illusion of Time  

Laboring and laying down one's apparently individuated life  

Expecting nothing but [[ONE]] in return. 

_____
## 29. 

Walking in the Way, one tastes the Valley of the Shadow of Death  

Walking in the Way, one cries tears of blood  

We journey through the hellish underworlds below  

So that others can walk the heavenly fields above  

We face the existential fears and cry the excrutiating tears  

So that others can laugh and play  

We courageously extend the Path into the Unknown  

So that those who come after can walk in an illuminated Way  

We [[Pass The Flame]] to those brave souls destined for ever greater things  

Bloodied, bruised, and betrayed, We rest in eternal peace with God
