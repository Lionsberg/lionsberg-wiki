# 1.15 Narrative Infrastructure
Because our Perception is fundamentally structured through a [[Narrative Framework]] that dictates our Identity, Values, and Direction, the entire global transformation will needed to be rooted _first_ in a global shift of Narrative, and therefore Paradigm, and therefore Way of Being. 

Our [[Current Best Understanding]] is that this should be unfolded through a universal [[Media Project]] centered around Story. 

The Media Project would create a cascading and exponentially accelerating wave of Stories by inviting individuals, organizations, and communities to articulate and align their individual and local stories with the unfolding [[Meta Story]]. 

This cascading series of Story ultimately becomes the core engine driving the crowd-funding of the energy and resources necessary to do the [[Work]] required to accomplish our highest shared [[Goal|Goals]].  

Therefore infrastructure and process should be created that helps individuals articulate and evolve over time: 

1. Their Story
2. Our Story
3. The Meta Story 

For a starting point and additional initial thoughts, see [[The Power of Today]], particularly [[3.0 Story]] and subsequent sections.
