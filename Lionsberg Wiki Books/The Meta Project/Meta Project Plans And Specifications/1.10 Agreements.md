# 1.10 Agreements
Just as each Individual is Sovereign and entitled to the equal rights of All other citizens, so too does each individual possesses the responsibility to co-operate with others in service of One and All. 

Co-operation is based upon voluntary [[Agreements]] between Sovereigns, made as they [[Organize and Federate]]. 

These [[Agreements]] are ordered by a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Agreements]].
