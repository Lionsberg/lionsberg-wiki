# 1.3 The Meta System
The word **Meta** as it is used in the [[LIONSBERG System]] is meant to point to the eternal, universal, ultimate, self-referential, highest order, all encompassing, most transcendent conception of an idea. 

The [[Meta System]] is therefore the highest universal overarching and uniting "System of Systems", that by definition contains within itself and orders all other possible Systems. 

It is a critical conceptual component of the [[LIONSBERG System]], which operates on our [[Current Best Understanding]] of the Logic or [[Logos]] of the universe. 

Along with All possible systems, the Meta System contains within itself [[1.4 The Living System]] and [[1.5 The Human System]].
