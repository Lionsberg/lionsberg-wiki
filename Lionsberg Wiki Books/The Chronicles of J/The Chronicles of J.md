# The Chronicles of J

On what would have been Jordan's 40th birthday, We received a beautiful leather journal from Our daughter Emma Joy, with the following note written on the first page: 
___

*To my Dadzie,* 

*I want to know about your past. The struggles and the wondrous moments.* 

*I thought this was a perfect place for you to write about your life, and one day I will read it and discover everything that made you, you...* 

*Happy 40th Birthday,* 

*Love,* 

*Emma Joy*

What follows is a [[Work In Progress]] being written in response to Our daughter's beautiful invitation. 

We tell Our [[Stories of Transformation]] as an invitation for you to share yours. 

May this be an encouragement to any of God's children desiring to hear from the heart and experiences of a father on Earth.  

1. [[Thank You Dearest Daughter. I Love You.]]
