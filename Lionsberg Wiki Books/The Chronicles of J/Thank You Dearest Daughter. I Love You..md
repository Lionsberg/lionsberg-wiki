# Thank You Dearest Daughter. I Love You.

Dearest Emzie, 

I love you so much. 

Thank you for the beautiful and thoughtful birthday gift. I am so impressed with you, and you keep getting [[A Little Better Every Day]] :) 

It means the world to me that you care, and are willing to invest time in getting to know me better. 

It is not always easy to be vulnerable and share deeply with one another. I will do my best, and please know I always love and desire to hear as deeply from you as you are able to share with me too. 

You are the best, I love you so very much, and there is more beauty and potential in you than you could ever know. 

Love, 

Your very own Dadzie
