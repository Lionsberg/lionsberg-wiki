# Thank You Dearest Daughter. I Love You.

Dearest Emzie, 

I love you so much. 

Thank you for the beautiful and thoughtful birthday gift. You have always had such a special way of seeing into the heart of things and offering something meaningful; this journal is a beautiful example. 

It means the world to me that you care, and are willing to invest time in getting to know me better. I can't wait to get to know you better too as Our Journey continues to unfold together.  

Life isn't always easy or simple to say the least, and sometimes it can feel difficult to share deeply with one another. It is not always easy to be vulnerable and share deeply with one another. This gift is a beautiful reminder of the love and trust I pray we will always share. I will do my best to fill these pages with stories that show you both who I have been in the past, and who I am becoming a life begins aNew at 40. 

Please know I always love and desire to hear as deeply from you as you are willing and able to share. Especially the hard or uncomfortable parts. Please receive these stories as an invitation for you to share your stories with me and the world in return. You are full of brilliant Light that the world is longing for. 

You are the best Emma Joy! I love you so very much, and there is more beauty and potential in you than you could ever know. 

Love, 

Your very own Dadzie
