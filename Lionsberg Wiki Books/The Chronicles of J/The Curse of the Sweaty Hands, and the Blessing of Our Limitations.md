# The Curse of the Sweaty Hands, and the Blessing of Our Limitations

One of the things I’ve struggled with since I was young is my perpetually sweaty hands.

When I was in school I would always have to tear out pieces of paper, fold them up, and put them under my hands. Sometimes I would go through a few in a single class. 

But it is one of the things that has made me, me. It was like a constant little thorn in the side, embarrassing and humbling me on a daily basis with every letter written, every hand I had to shake, every chord I played on the guitar, every time I wanted to hold a girls hand. 

But over time, I learned something important. These bodies we inhabit are always [[Perfectly Imperfect]]. Yes, it can feel messy, cringy, and even gross to be in a body sometimes. But having a body is what lets us experience life—its wonders, its quirks, its joys.

In a [[Better World]], We would [[All]] be kinder to Our Selves and to [[One Another]], embracing Our perfect imperfections instead of hiding them. Because those imperfections are part of what makes Us uniquely Us.

There’s an old proverb I like:

_"If God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, what is the only thing that is lacking?"_

The answer is [[Something Like]] **limitation.**

So why would the Perfect, Infinite, and Whole choose to incarnate, fragment, and separate ItSelf? 

To experience and know ItSelf through each of its unique aspects. 

You, my beautiful daughter, are a perfectly imperfect aspect of the Divine; an incarnate fragment of God. The [[Deeper]] you look within, and the more [[Ego]] and [[Attachments]] you shed, the more you will discover that despite Our [[Apparent Individuation]], We Are [[ONE]]. 

Our limitations may frustrate us, but they also teach us compassion, humility, and resilience. They remind us to laugh, to forgive, and to see the beauty in the small, imperfect moments that compose [[A Life Well Lived]]. 

It is the experience of Our limitations and the process of transcending them that ultimately leads Us [[All]] back to the [[ONE]]. 

So, if I draft my responses to your beautiful prompt digitally instead of on paper, please forgive my limitations, and know this: the journal you gave me is perfect, just like you.

With love and sweaty hands,  

Dadzie
