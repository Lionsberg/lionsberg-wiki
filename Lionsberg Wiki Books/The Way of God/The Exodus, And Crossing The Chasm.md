# The Exodus, And Crossing The Chasm

In [[The Story]], [[The Old]] and [[The New]] are always separated by [[The Wilderness]]. 

There is always a [[Chasm]] between [[Where We Are]], and [[Where We Are Going]]. 

The [[Quest]] towards the [[New World]] requires that we awaken, arise, and depart from [[The Old]] on our [[Way]] towards [[The New]]. 

*Depart, depart, go out from there;
touch no unclean thing;
go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves,
you who bear the vessels of the LORD.
For you shall not go out in haste,
and you shall not go in flight,
for the LORD will go before you,
and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.*

[[The Exodus]] from the [[Old]] to [[New]] is not by the might, power, or will of the people, but by the might, power, and will of [[God]].  

It is only in partnership with [[God]], and by the strength of [[God]], that we can successfully [[Cross The Chasm]]. 

*And it shall be said, “Build up, build up, prepare the way,
remove every obstruction from my people's [[Way]].”*
