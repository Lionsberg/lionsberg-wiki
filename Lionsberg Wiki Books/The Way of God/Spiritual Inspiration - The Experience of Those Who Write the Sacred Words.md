# Spiritual Inspiration - The Experience of Those Who Write the Sacred Words

Moving from the universal concept of the Logos to the particular human experiences that progressively articulate the Divine Word into text, we delve into the realm of spiritual inspiration. The individuals who have penned the sacred scriptures have often spoken of a transcendent experience that guides their hand—a sense of being conduits for a Spirit, Wisdom and Truth far greater than themselves. *It felt as if the Words were writing me.*

However, this is often not a passive transcription but inspired and active Co-Creation. The Spirit of God engages the full faculties of the human agents—their language, culture, context, intellectual capabilities, spiritual depth, hopes, fears, and unique perspectives—imbuing the resulting text with a layered richness that reflects both Divine Origin and human participation.

The dynamic between the Divine and the human in the act of writing *what is later recognized and canonized as scriptural* can also be likened to a resonant dialogue or an intimate dance, where each participant is indispensable in Co-Creating the harmonious whole. Like an artist absorbed in the flow state, the writers of these sacred texts find their individuality paradoxically more pronounced even as they merge into a greater, collective expression of the Divine will.

Yet, even as they engage in this celestial choreography, the authors remain rooted in their socio-cultural contexts, utilizing idioms, symbols, and stories accessible to their immediate audience. It is important to remember that when the scriptures were written, the authors did not know they were writing scripture. In many cases the written scripture we have today was an oral tradition for generations before it was written, stories, principles, and values passed down from grandparents to grandchildren. Other texts we regard as scripture were written as letters, filled with the personality, frustrations, and personal concerns of the author. Others were written as poetry, songs, aphorisms, or verbal descriptions of imagistic visions. In other cases, an angel dictates what to write. This dual grounding—both in the ineffable realms of spiritual experience and in the tangible and messy realities of earthly life—creates a text that is simultaneously universal and particular, timeless and situated, inviting all of humanity into a continual process of interpretive engagement and spiritual evolution.

This act of inspired writing, then, is not merely a historical event but an ongoing, eternal process, a part of the ever-unfolding dialogue between humanity and the Divine. The Spirit of God can write through us too if we attune our Selves carefully enough. It is an extension of the same cosmic drama the Logos scripts and informs, offering an inspirational path toward alignment with the eternal principles and immutable truths that are the hallmarks of Ultimate Reality.

Inspired Writing is a principle form of prayerful Dialogue, or Dia-Logos, with the Divine.
