# Depth, Breadth and Spiritual Resonance - A Triaxial Methodology for Canonical Assessment

In charting a Meta-Canonical Wisdom, three pivotal axes materialize as guiding dimensions: Depth, Breadth, and Spiritual Resonance. 

Depth offers an analytical focus on a text's structural significance. It considers the foundational influence of a text's ideas on subsequent intellectual landscapes, calculates the text's generative capacity—i.e., the myriad other texts, principles, institutions, and cultural expressions that are birthed from it—and gauges how deeply its principles permeate the very fabric of the societies that enshrine it. Depth thus represents the vertical axis, cutting through the stratified layers of meaning, influence, and cultural tradition that are built up upon it.

Breadth presents a complementary vista. It measures the temporal and spatial expanse of a text's influence. How long has the text been influential? To how many people? Across what geographical expanses and cultural milieus? How diversified are its interpretative traditions? Breadth serves as the horizontal axis, capturing the trans-temporal and cross-cultural dimensions of a text's impact.

Spiritual Resonance introduces an experiential and transcendent dimension, serving as the 'z-axis' in our triaxial schema. This axis concerns the ineffable quality of a text to resonate with the deepest and highest aspects of the human spirit, to invoke experiences of the Sacred, and to catalyze transformational shifts in consciousness and society. It transcends intellectual assent, piercing the veils of mere knowing into realms of deep, mystical experiencing of the Spirit and Presence of God in a text.

The employment of these three axes generates a robust, multidimensional framework for canonical assessment. Such an analytical toolset is indispensable for the conscientious seeker of Wisdom and Truth, as well as for the reconciler of disparate traditions and worldviews. It accommodates both the critical reverence for diverse Wisdom traditions and the discerning nuance required to acknowledge that canonicity varies in degree and type—a variation that demands Wise reconciliation and intermediation by the Spirit of God.

When it comes to temporal strategy and sequence for immersion into canonical texts, this triaxial methodology suggests an approach: to commence with those texts that exhibit the highest metrics across Depth, Breadth, and Spiritual Resonance. This is not to devalue other texts but to efficiently navigate towards the texts with maximal proven potential for enlightenment and transformation. The methodology thus serves as a dynamic roadmap for the seeker, who is encouraged to cross-reference, scrutinize, and synthesize the Eternal and Universal across diverse texts. In this journey, it should be remembered that Wisdom and Truth not only withstand but indeed invite and demand the most penetrating inquiry we are capable of mustering. They are never threatened by it; they are illuminated by it. Truth never fears inquiry.
