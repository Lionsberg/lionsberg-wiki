# The Spirit And The Incarnation

The verses above, and the full prophesy of the [[Messiah]], illuminate the differentiated unity between the LORD, the Spirit of the LORD, and the incarnation of a prototypical being upon whom the Spirit of the LORD rests, from whom the Spirit of the LORD speaks, and through whom the Spirit of LORD establishes the [[Kingdom of God]]. 

What we see in the visual imagery of the one upon whom the Spirit of the LORD rests, is what God would do in that time and place - judging righteously, slaying the wicked, and establishing the Kingdom of God. 

The [[Spirit of God]] is universal and eternal. Its [[Incarnation]] in the person of the [[Messiah]] in a [[Time]] and [[Space]] reflects the essence of [[Wise Right]] action in that time and place, to vanquish corruption and injustice, and co-create the [[New World]].
