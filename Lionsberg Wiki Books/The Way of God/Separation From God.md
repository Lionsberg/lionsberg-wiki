# Separation From God

Let us *feel* what separation from God feels like: 

*Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,
or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
but your iniquities have made a separation
between you and your God,
and your sins have hidden his face from you
so that he does not hear.*

*I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me;
I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me.
I said, “Here I am, here I am,”
to a nation that was not called by my name.
I spread out my hands all the day
to a rebellious people,
who walk in a way that is not good.*

*These have chosen their own ways,
and their soul delights in their abominations;
I also will choose harsh treatment for them
and bring their fears upon them,
because when I called, no one answered,
when I spoke, they did not listen;
but they did what was evil in my eyes
and chose that in which I did not delight.*

Separation from God whose essence is [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]] is a [[Conscious Decision]] that humanity makes. [[God]] remains ever-present, ever-longing, ever-faithful, ever-calling, every-beckoning.
