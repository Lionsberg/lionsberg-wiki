# The One That Unites The Many

If we are to have any hope of co-operating as One Body, we must first begin to understand how to co-operate with [[God]], for it is only [[God]], the Creator of the Universe, that can reunite and save the Body of It's Creation. There is only [[ONE]] that can unite us [[All]]. *By definition.* 

This is not a matter of religious belief. It is a strict matter of definition. 

Whatever else God is, *by definition* [[God]] is the [[ONE]] thing that unites [[The Many]]. 

It is tempting in this age, when we have forgotten What and Who [[God]] is, to look shallower for That Which Unites Us All. We may be tempted to look to [[Nature]], or even to concretize the goddess of Nature, and bow down to her. 

However any minor study of [[Nature]], [[Theology]], of [[Philosophy]] will reveal that while indeed she is the substance from which All Creation arises, there is something [[Deeper]] upon which she arises and depends. 

If we just continue to ask what is [[Deeper]], eventually we always arrive back at the [[ONE]] [[Ultimate Reality]] guiding the subsequent transformations of [[Reality]] across [[Time]] and [[Space]]. This is the realm of [[God]]. 

We know intuitively that the [[Creator]] must be distinguished from [[Creation]]. While [[Creation]] flows from its [[Source]], they are not the same thing precisely. Creation is always transforming, evolving, improving. Its [[Source]] remains the same. Everything in [[Nature]] cycles, rises, and falls, according to the [[Logos]] guiding it. The mountains rise and fall over millennia, kingdoms and trees rise and fall over centuries, people and animals rise and fall over decades, thoughts and insects rise and fall over days, and subatomic cycles of energy rise and fall over nanoseconds. Everything, composed of energy, has, as it were, a wavelength and periodicity, all connected back to and informed by the [[Source]] of all [[Mass-Energy]] and the [[Information]] that instructs it how to animate into [[Form]].  

Therefore it is crucial that we see beyond the burning bush of [[Nature]], to perceive the [[Spirit]] of [[God]] that calls to us from within. 

The [[I Am]]. The [[Uncaused Cause]]. The [[Ultimate Reality]] upon which [[Reality]] depends. The [[Absolute]]. 

The [[LORD]]. [[God]]. [[Creator]]. 

[[Creator]] and [[Creation]]. [[ONE]] and [[All]]. The [[ONE]] thing that occupies the [[Absolute]] Highest Place in the Total Nested Hierarchy of Creation, and encompasses, orders, and united [[All]] [[Creation]] within Itself. The [[ONE]] [[Deepest]] thing, upon which [[All]] else arises and depends. The Foundation. The [[Ground of Being]]. The [[Alpha And Omega]]. The [[Beginning And End]]. The [[Source and Sustainer]] of [[All]]. 

If we are to become [[United As One]], *by definition* only [[God]], the [[Absolute]], can be placed at [[The Center]].
