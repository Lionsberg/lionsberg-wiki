# Culture and Context - The Time and Place in Which Word Tools are Articulated

The problem of translating Spirit across Time and Space gets even more difficult when we understand that inspired authors are not only limited by the Word Tools available in their local language, but are also drawing on an entire local culture and context to speak them.  Words are not written in a vacuum - they are 'incarnated' in a specific Time and Space that gives them meaning. The same word tools spoken in two different cultural contexts could mean vastly different things. 

The role of culture and context in the articulation of word tools must not be underestimated. Our understanding and description of Ultimate Reality, Spirit, and Logos are deeply embedded in the socio-cultural milieu from which they emerge. Each epoch, each civilization, and each culture crafts its own set of symbols, myths, and words to capture their understanding of the Divine and the Spiritual and moral fabric that undergirds their collective consciousness as they grope and feel their Way towards God. 

While this can lead to fear, misinterpretation and misunderstanding, it also provides a rich tapestry of perspectives that contribute to a more holistic understanding of the experience of tribes, cultures, and peoples around the world with the Divine. When these various cultural articulations are seen not as competitive but as complementary, they enrich our collective wisdom and broaden the spectrum of our spiritual understanding. This patchwork of perspectives derived from direct local experience with the Divine over millennia is not a problem to be solved, but a gift to be embraced, allowing us to glimpse the multifaceted Nature of Ultimate Reality through different lenses and experiences. As the tribes and nations of the world feel their Way towards God, Truth is never threatened in the process. 

However, culture and context, while enriching, can also be limiting factors. Over-reliance on culturally-bound word tools can lead to misleading dogmatism, and an excessive focus on the particulars of time and place can result in the loss of the universal and eternal truths they aim to capture. The challenge, then, is to discern the core, immutable principles from the cultural wrappings in which they are presented, and apply them in partnership with the Spirit of God to Here and Now.

In this complex interplay of time, place, and transcendent realities, the discerning spiritual seeker recognizes the importance of both honoring the particularities of culture and context while continually striving to transcend them and see more clearly from the Universal and Eternal perspective of God. It is through this delicate balancing act that we can best approach the task of articulating and comprehending the ineffable Divine, as we participate in the ongoing, eternal, unfolding dialogue of creative consciousness with God.
