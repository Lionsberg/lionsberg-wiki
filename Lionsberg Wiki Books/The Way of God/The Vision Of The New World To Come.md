# The Vision Of The New World To Come

As the [[Spirit of God]] annunciates the [[New World]], or [[World To Come]], we are invited into the [[Vision]] of what it look look like, taste like, smell like, feel like, and be like. 

*Arise, shine, for your light has come,
and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
and thick darkness the peoples;
but the LORD will arise upon you,
and his glory will be seen upon you.
And nations shall come to your light,
and kings to the brightness of your rising.
Lift up your eyes all around, and see;
they all gather together, they come to you;*

*Your gates shall be open continually;
day and night they shall not be shut,
that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations,
with their kings led in procession.
For the nation and kingdom
that will not serve you shall perish;
those nations shall be utterly laid waste.*

*The sons of those who afflicted you
shall come bending low to you,
and all who despised you
shall bow down at your feet*

*Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
and instead of iron I will bring silver;
instead of wood, bronze,
instead of stones, iron.*

*I will make your overseers peace
and your taskmasters righteousness.*

*Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
devastation or destruction within your borders;
you shall call your walls Salvation,
and your gates Praise.*

*Your people shall all be righteous;
they shall possess the land forever.*

*They shall build up the ancient ruins;
they shall raise up the former devastations;
they shall repair the ruined cities,
the devastations of many generations.*

*For I the LORD love justice;
I hate robbery and wrong;
I will faithfully give them their recompense,
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

*For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up,
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise
to sprout up before all the nations.*

*The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
the lion shall eat straw like the ox,
and dust shall be the serpent's food.
They shall not hurt or destroy
in all my holy mountain,‚Äù
says the LORD.*

*The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,
and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together;
and a little child shall lead them.
The cow and the bear shall graze;
their young shall lie down together;
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,
and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.
***They shall not hurt or destroy***
in all my holy mountain;
***for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD
as the waters cover the sea***.*

Back to the root cause - the statement above is *causal* - they shall not hurt or destroy, ***for*** the Earth shall be full of the [[Knowledge of God]].  

The Vision of the [[New World]] is simply a reflection of the Will and Intention of [[God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

[[Knowledge]] leads, [[Heaven On Earth]] follows.
