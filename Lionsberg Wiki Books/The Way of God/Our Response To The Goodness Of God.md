# Our Response To The Goodness Of God

What response to such a proposition could we possibly have, except gratitude, awe, wonder, and praise? 

*I will give thanks to you, O LORD*
*Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust, and will not be afraid*  
*The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation*  
*Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name*
*Make known His deeds among the peoples, proclaim that His name is exalted*
*Sing praises to the LORD for He has done gloriously*
*Let this be made known in all the Earth.*

It is amazing that this response from the [[Spirit]] in Isaiah ends with the exhortation to *let this be made KNOWN in all the Earth*, for remember, when the [[Knowledge of God]] [[Covers The Earth Like Floodwaters]], ***then*** the [[Best Possible Future]] unfolds. 

On that day, *the whole earth is at rest and quiet;
they break forth into singing.

Can you hear [[All Creation]] signing and crying out to [[God]]? 

Let us immerse our [[Selves]] every deeper into the [[Way of God]] and the [[Knowledge of God]], and as we [[Progressively Realize]] them, let us make them known in all the Earth. 

This is the [[Way]], walk ye in it.
