# The Prophetic Voice

One place to begin to "hear" the [[Voice of God]] is through [[Scripture]], and one place in scripture that speaks most explicitly to the heart and desire of [[God]] is through the [[Prophetic Voice]]. 

One the most famous prophetic voices is that of [[Isaiah]]. 

Isaiah spoke to a spiritually "[[Deaf]] and [[Blind]]" people who lived during the decline of Israel somewhere around 700 years [[Before Christ]].  

He warned [[Israel]] of the impending catastrophe that lay ahead as a result of their [[Way of Being]], while offering the hope of a [[New Creation]] or [[World To Come]]; a time when the [[Knowledge of God]] [[Covers The Earth Like Floodwaters]] and God reigns as King, judging and vanquishing the wicked, and establishing eternal righteousness, harmony, peace and prosperity. 

In the words of Isaiah, we can find the [[Word of God|Words of God]] that allow us to sense the [[Spirit of God]] and the [[Way of God]]. Note the use here in this sentence of Word, Spirit, Way, and God.
