# What Is At Stake?

What is at stake is nothing short of [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]]. 

## The Offer 

Although we have departed from the [[Way]], there is a perpetual offer from [[God]] of [[Mercy]], [[Grace]], and [[At-One-Ment]]. 

*“Come now, let us **reason** together, says the LORD:
though your **sins** are like scarlet,
they shall be as **white as snow**;
though they are red like crimson,
they shall become like wool.

## The Condition 

The condition of this forgiveness, [[Reconciliation]], and [[At-One-Ment]], is willingness and obedience, because [[God]] does not violate our [[Free Will]] or impose His Kingdom upon us. 

*"**If** you are willing and obedient..."*

### The Outcome - Heaven or Hell on Earth and Beyond 

*"**If** you are willing and obedient, 
**you shall** eat the good of the land;
**but if** you refuse and rebel,
**you shall** be eaten by the sword;
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”*
