# God And Justice Will Prevail - In Strength

***"Therefore the Lord declares"***

*"I will get relief from my enemies
and avenge myself on my foes"*

*"I will turn my hand against you"*

*"I will restore your judges... and your counselors"*

*"rebels and sinners shall be broken together,
and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed"*

*"the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark,
and both of them shall burn together,
with none to quench them."*

*"Hide in the the dust from before the terror of the LORD."*

*"The lofty pride of men shall be humbled."*

*"The idols shall utterly pass away"*

*"And people shall enter the caves of the rocks
and the holes of the ground,
from before the terror of the LORD,
and from the splendor of his majesty,
when he rises to terrify the earth."*

*"Behold, the LORD will empty the earth and make it desolate,
and he will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants."*

*"The earth mourns and withers;
the world languishes and withers;
the highest people of the earth languish.
The earth lies defiled
under its inhabitants;
for they have transgressed the laws,
violated the statutes,
broken the everlasting covenant.
Therefore a curse devours the earth,
and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt;
therefore the inhabitants of the earth are scorched,
and few men are left."*

*"But I say, “I waste away,
I waste away. Woe is me!
For the traitors have betrayed,
with betrayal the traitors have betrayed.”*

*"Terror and the pit and the snare
are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!
He who flees at the sound of the terror
shall fall into the pit,
and he who climbs out of the pit
shall be caught in the snare."*

"*When the overwhelming scourge passes through,
you will be beaten down by it.
As often as it passes through it will take you;
for morning by morning it will pass through,
by day and by night;
and it will be sheer terror to understand the message.*"

*Come, my people, enter your chambers,
and shut your doors behind you;
hide yourselves for a little while
until the fury has passed by.
For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place
to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,
and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it,
and will no more cover its slain.*

*The sound of an uproar from the city!
A sound from the temple!
The sound of the LORD,
rendering recompense to his enemies!*

*For behold, the LORD will come in fire,
and his chariots like the whirlwind,
to render his anger in fury,
and his rebuke with flames of fire.
For by fire will the LORD enter into judgment,
and by his sword, with all flesh;
and those slain by the LORD shall be many.*

## The Aftermath of Justice 

*I will make justice the line,
and righteousness the plumb line;
and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
and waters will overwhelm the shelter (of falsehood).*

***you shall be called** the city of **righteousness**,
the **faithful** city.*

It shall come to pass in the latter days
that **the mountain** of the house of the LORD
**shall be established** as **the highest** of the mountains,
and **shall be lifted up** above the hills;
and **all the nations** shall flow to it,
and **many peoples** shall come, and say:
“**Come, let us go up** to the mountain of the LORD,
to the house of the God of Jacob,
that **he may teach us his ways**
and that **we may walk in his paths**.”
For out of Zion shall go forth **the law**,
and **the word** of the LORD from Jerusalem.
He shall **judge between the nations**,
and shall **decide disputes for many peoples**;
and they shall **beat their swords into plowshares**,
and their **spears into pruning hooks**;
**nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war anymore"**.*

*The LORD alone will be exalted in that day.*

*Behold, a king will reign in righteousness,
and princes will rule in justice.
Each will be like a hiding place from the wind,
a shelter from the storm,
like streams of water in a dry place,
like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.*

*Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you,
and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you.
For the LORD is a God of justice;
blessed are all those who wait for him.*

*He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you. And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.*

*(The desolation will only endure) until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,
and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
And the effect of righteousness will be peace,
and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever.*

*And a highway shall be there,
and it shall be called the Way of Holiness;
the unclean shall not pass over it.
It shall belong to those who walk on the Way.*

## Exhortations

*O, come, let us walk
in the [[Light]] of the [[LORD]].*

*The fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.*

*The fear of the LORD is the beginning of Wisdom.*

*The LORD is our Judge; the LORD is our Lawgiver; the LORD is our King.*

*A voice cries:
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD;
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be lifted up,
and every mountain and hill be made low;
the uneven ground shall become level,
and the rough places a plain.
And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,
and all flesh shall see it together,
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.*"

*This is the Way, walk in it.*
