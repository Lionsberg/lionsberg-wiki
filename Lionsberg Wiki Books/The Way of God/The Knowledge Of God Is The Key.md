# The Knowledge Of God Is The Key

In Isaiah, we hear the [[Spirit of God]] proclaiming the importance of [[Knowledge]] as the key that unlocks the gateways of [[Destiny]]. 

In the negative, we hear articulations such as: 

"*Therefore my people go into exile for lack of [[Knowledge]]*"

On the positive side, we hear the promise of statements such as: 

"*When the [[Knowledge of God]] covers the Earth like floodwaters...*" (**then** the [[New World]] is at hand).

What enables humanity to co-create [[Heaven On Earth]] is the [[Knowledge of God]]. What drives them apart and into exile is lack of [[Knowledge]], and the most important Knowledge is the [[Knowledge of God]]. The [[Knowledge of God]] is what orders within itself and unites all other forms and subsets of knowing.
