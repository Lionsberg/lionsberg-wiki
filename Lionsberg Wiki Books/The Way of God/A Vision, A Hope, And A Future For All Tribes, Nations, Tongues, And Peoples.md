# A Vision, A Hope, And A Future For All Tribes, Nations, Tongues, And Peoples

Scripture makes it clear the that [[Vision]] and [[Hope]] of the [[New Covenant]] is not just for one tribe or nation, but for all tribes, all nations, all tongues, and all peoples. 

*And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,
to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD,
and to be his servants,
everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,
and holds fast my covenant —
these I will bring to my holy mountain,
and make them joyful in my house of prayer;
...for my house shall be called a house of prayer
for **all peoples**.”*

*"He who takes refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain."*

*For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather **all nations and tongues**. And they shall come and shall see my glory, and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations... And they shall declare my glory among the nations.*

*For as the [[New]] heavens and the [[New]] earth that I make
shall remain before me, says the LORD,
so shall your offspring and your name remain.
From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath,
[[All]] flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD.

The Vision, Invitation, and Hope is open and freely available to [[All]]. 

*Come, everyone who thirsts,
come to the waters;
and he who has no money,
come, buy and eat!
Come, buy wine and milk
without money and without price.*
