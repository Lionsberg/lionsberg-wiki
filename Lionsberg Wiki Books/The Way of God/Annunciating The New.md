# Annunciating The New

There is an amazing characteristic of the Spirit of God and the [[Messiah]], in that they are perpetually annunciating the [[The New]] and differentiating it from [[The Old]]. 

Here is Isaiah are a few examples: 

*Behold, the former things have come to pass, and [[New]] things I now declare.*

*Sing to the LORD a [[New Song]], his praise from the end of the earth*

*Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of [[Old]].
Behold, I am doing a [[New]] thing;
now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?*

*From this time forth I announce to you [[New]] things,
hidden things that you have not known.*

*For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,
and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet,
until her righteousness goes forth as brightness,
and her salvation as a burning torch.
The nations shall see your righteousness,
and all the kings your glory,
and you shall be called by a [[New Name]] 
that the mouth of the LORD will give.*

*For behold, I create [[New]] heavens
and a [[New]] earth,
and the former things shall not be remembered
or come into mind.*

Throughout scripture, we see the prophesy and theme of [[New]] heavens, [[New]] earth, [[New]] name, [[New]] life, [[New]] covenant. 

The [[New]] is continually juxtaposed with the [[Old]], or former, things that are passing away. 

*Behold, I am making All things New.*
