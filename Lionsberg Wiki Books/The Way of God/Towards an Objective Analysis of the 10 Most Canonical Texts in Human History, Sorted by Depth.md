# Towards an Objective Analysis of the 10 Most Canonical Texts in Human History, Sorted by Depth

In the labyrinthine landscape of human thought and spirituality, certain texts stand as monumental landmarks, shaping the terrain for miles around. Utilizing a triaxial methodology grounded in Depth, Breadth, and Spiritual Resonance, this analysis aims to discern the ten most canonical texts that have served as the bedrock for civilizations, belief systems, and individual lives. The evaluation is conducted with an eye for historical impact, intellectual rigor, and spiritual significance, offering a starting point for those engaged in the most serious quests for Wisdom and Truth.

### 1. The Bible 

The depth of the Christian Bible's impact is unparalleled, not merely in its contributions to religious thought but also in the realms of philosophy, law, ethics, art, and culture. The Bible has engendered multiple streams of theological thought, giving rise to various Christian denominations such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy. These denominations have, in turn, built vast intellectual edifices grounded in biblical principles. Consider works like Augustine's "City of God" or Thomas Aquinas's "Summa Theologica," which serve as cornerstone texts for entire schools of theological inquiry and which owe their foundational premises to the Bible. Furthermore, the Bible has informed Western jurisprudence and ethics, with principles becoming deeply entrenched in Western thought. The Bible serves as the seedbed from which countless texts, ideas, principles, and institutions have grown.

The breadth of the Bible's influence is equally staggering. With an estimated adherence of 31% of the human population, the Christian faith spans every continent and encompasses myriad cultures. It has been translated into over 3,000 languages, making it the most translated text in human history. Its stories and principles have been adapted into countless art forms, from the high art of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel to the folk traditions of spiritual hymns and gospel music. Moreover, its impact is not confined to religious institutions; its narratives and teachings permeate everyday life and culture, often in ways so subtle that they escape overt notice.

As for spiritual resonance, the Bible engages deeply with the human experience, offering insights into the nature of God, the cosmos, and the human soul. It serves as a guide for personal morality and social ethics, while also providing a framework for understanding existential questions about suffering, joy, and the ultimate purpose of human life. Whether in the soaring poetry of the Psalms, the moral directives of the Ten Commandments, or the eschatological promises of Revelation, the Bible provides manifold paths for spiritual contemplation and fulfillment. It stands not just as a historical document but as a living, breathing text that continues to offer new layers of meaning upon each reading. Its teachings are regarded as divinely inspired, providing a roadmap for spiritual enlightenment and an everlasting relationship with the Divine.

Through these dimensions—depth, breadth, and spiritual resonance—the Bible merits its place at the apex of canonical texts, serving as a pivotal axis around which much of human history and thought revolve.

### 2. Hebrew Scriptures (Tanakh)

The Tanakh, or the Hebrew Bible, is the foundational text for Judaism and serves as the bedrock upon which much of Christian theology is built, evidenced by its inclusion in the Christian Bible as the Old Testament. Its depth is immense, providing the first codified monotheistic belief system and influencing not only religious thought but also philosophy, ethics, and law. The legalistic principles found in the Torah have informed Jewish Halakha and have had a considerable impact on Western jurisprudence. Books like Job have wrestled with existential questions that have been revisited through millennia in multiple cultures. The wisdom literature, such as the book of Proverbs, has informed ethical thinking not just within Judaism but also in the broader context of human moral philosophy.

When considering breadth, the Tanakh's influence, though perhaps not as directly globally widespread as the Bible, is monumental. Its tenets laid the groundwork for both Christianity and Islam, which are the world’s largest religions, together encompassing over half of humanity. Its principles are echoed in Western laws, in ethical systems, and even in literature and art, from the sculptures of Michelangelo to the plays of Shakespeare that are laden with biblical allegories and themes. The Tanakh serves as a cultural cornerstone for the Jewish people, who, despite their relatively small numbers, have had a disproportionately large influence on global thought, culture, and history.

In terms of spiritual resonance, the Tanakh engages profoundly with questions of God's nature, human morality, the problem of evil, and the ultimate purpose of life—issues that have preoccupied religious and philosophical thought for millennia. Its accounts of human struggles, divine interventions, and the quest for righteousness serve as archetypical narratives that resonate deeply with our collective human experience. Moreover, the text provides rich theological insights: the concept of a covenantal relationship with God, principles of justice, compassion, and shalom, and foundational rituals and festivals that aim to elevate the spiritual state of its adherents and maintain remembrance across the system throughout the generations.

Though it may not have as extensive a reach as the Bible, the Tanakh’s foundational influence on the Abrahamic religions and thus on global religious thought, its deep-rooted impact on ethics, law, and philosophy, and its profound spiritual resonance solidify its position as the second most canonical text. It is the root from which the Christian Bible, and to some extent other religious and philosophical traditions, have sprouted, making its depth and breadth indispensable in a study of influential texts.

### 3. Quran 

The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, claims a pivotal spot in the annals of canonical literature for its deep theological, legal, and ethical underpinnings and its breadth of reach and influence. Written in the 7th century CE, it proposes a rigorous monotheism that builds upon the Abrahamic traditions, notably Judaism and Christianity. Unlike the diverse tapestries forged over millennia and woven into the Tanakh and the Bible, the Quran was written by one individual, the Prophet Muhammad, from the time he was 40 years old until his death 23 years later, and is considered by Muslims to be the final revelation of the word of God via the angel Gabriel. 

Amidst the historical strife between Muslims, Jews, and Christians (collectively known as Ahl al-kitab, or People of the Book), it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the Prophet considered the revelation to be a *confirmation and continuation* of the earlier scriptures known to the Jewish and Christian communities. Specifically mentioning the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel revealed to Jesus (Isa in Arabic) and building upon the previous scriptures of the Abrahamic traditions, the Quran exhibits an "intertextuality" that requires it to be interpreted with and in the context of the scriptures it validates and arises from. While the Quran confirms the canonical nature of the previous scriptures, at least the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel of Jesus, this challenge is made deeper by the belief that the Gospel as revealed to Jesus and articulated in Aramaic was not preserved in its purity and entirety, and was corrupted in the process of translation into Greek and canonization. 

In terms of depth, the Quran stands in a middle ground, arising from previous Jewish and Christian scriptures, and subsequently spawning an intricate theological system including doctrines of God's attributes, angels, divine destiny, and the end times. Its legal prescriptions, known as Sharia, have influenced vast legal systems across multiple countries, and its financial doctrines continue to inform financial systems in various parts of the world. Philosophically, it has also interacted with elements of Greek thought, including rationalism, via Islamic scholars such as Avicenna and Averroes.

The breadth of the Quran’s influence is monumental, shaping the religious, ethical, and sociopolitical landscapes of countries from Morocco to Indonesia and beyond. Islam is the world’s second-largest religion, with estimates indicating that nearly a quarter of the global population identified as Muslim as of 2023. Its teachings have permeated cultures across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and even pockets of Europe and the Americas. The Quran has inspired a rich tapestry of art, architecture, and music, deeply influenced literature, and serves as a focal point for educational systems in many Muslim-majority countries.

Spiritual resonance, especially when it is verbally recited in classical Arabic, is one of the defining aspects of the Quran. For its adherents, the text is not merely an instructive guide but the ultimate source of spiritual wisdom. The very act of reciting the Quran is considered a spiritual exercise, and its verses are often memorized and cited in daily life. Concepts such as divine justice, compassion, and community welfare are recurrent themes. Its eschatological teachings offer an intricate portrayal of the afterlife, intended to guide moral and ethical behavior here on earth. Moreover, it addresses the heart and the intellect, aiming to show that faith is not only a matter of the spirit but also of reason and pragmatic social transformation.

The Quran's vast influence on religious thought, its shaping of legal, ethical, and cultural systems, and its spiritual resonance with its adherents make it an indispensable text in a study of canonical works. Its capacity to influence multiple facets of human life, from the individual's moral compass to societal structures, marks its significance. The Quran serves as a central nucleus around which a rich tradition of commentary, jurisprudence, philosophy, and mysticism have developed, enhancing its depth and confirming its position as the third most canonical text. 

### 4. Bhagavad Gita 

The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and guide. In terms of depth, the text is a remarkable synthesis of multiple paths of spirituality and philosophy, encapsulating the vast diversity of thought within Hinduism itself. It touches upon a wide range of theological and philosophical issues, including the nature of God, the self, and the universe. Concepts like dharma and karma are intricately examined, and the text has given rise to various commentaries and schools of thought within Hindu philosophy, such as Advaita Vedanta and Bhakti.

The breadth of the Gita's influence is perhaps best understood by its widespread acceptance not only within various Hindu traditions but also its reverence in a broader philosophical and spiritual context. A a cornerstone text for Hindus comprising roughly 15% of the world's population, it has gained international fame and has been commented upon by various philosophers and scholars, both Eastern and Western. In India, its teachings have influenced social and political leaders, most notably Mahatma Gandhi, who considered it his spiritual guidebook and birthed one of the most powerful liberation movements in history. Moreover, its principles and philosophies have been integrated into the larger corpus of yoga, which has achieved global prevalence across religious and cultural lines.

When it comes to spiritual resonance, the Bhagavad Gita serves as a manual for a balanced life and aims to set an individual on the path of spiritual realization. It has profound psychological insights, guiding individuals through the complexities of duty and righteousness, offering wisdom on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. The text itself is often used as a focal point in various spiritual practices, including chants and meditations, transcending its status as mere scripture and serving as a key tool in spiritual exercises.

Considering the depth of its philosophical and theological teachings, the breadth of its influence, and its considerable spiritual resonance, the Bhagavad Gita holds a well-deserved place among the most canonical texts. It has acted as a foundational stone for Hindu thought, and its principles have resonated deeply across a myriad of cultures and philosophical systems, contributing to its overall depth. Though it may not have the geographical reach of Abrahamic texts, its ideas have influenced a diverse range of thinkers, theologians, and spiritual practitioners, both within and outside of its cultural point of origin, affirming its canonical status.

### 5. Tao Te Ching

The Tao Te Ching is an ancient Chinese text attributed to Lao Tzu, a semi-legendary figure said to have lived in the 6th century BCE. As a foundational text of Taoism, its depth is evident in the complexity and intricacy of its teachings on the Tao (the Way), a concept that has been foundational to Chinese spirituality, philosophy, and culture. The text deals with themes of ineffableness, naturalness, balance, and the interplay of opposites, and serves as a guide to virtuous living and governance. Moreover, the Tao Te Ching has inspired a variety of interpretations and commentaries that have led to the establishment of various schools of Taoist philosophy, as well as influencing other philosophical traditions like Confucianism and Chinese Buddhism.

In terms of breadth, the Tao Te Ching's influence is not confined to China or even the East; it has found a global audience. Its ideas have permeated a wide range of disciplines beyond philosophy and religion, including governance, martial arts, medicine, and even strategic thinking. The text has been translated into numerous languages and has inspired a plethora of works in literature, art, and philosophy across different cultures. Its application is also evident in modern discussions about environmentalism, psychology, and ethics.

Spiritual Resonance is an area where the Tao Te Ching holds undeniable influence. Its teachings on harmony, balance, and natural order resonate deeply with human intuitions about well-being and the good life. It emphasizes a form of wisdom that is both practical and deeply spiritual, involving an alignment with the Tao as a form of ultimate understanding and enlightenment. The text's aphoristic and poetic style allows for meditative reading, and its teachings often serve as focal points in spiritual practice, whether in the context of traditional Chinese spirituality or broader modern interpretations.

Considering these dimensions—its deep philosophical underpinnings, its wide-ranging influence, and its significant spiritual resonance—the Tao Te Ching justifiably ranks among the most canonical texts in human history. While its reach may not be as extensively global in terms of sheer numbers as some other texts, its ideas have a trans-cultural appeal that has influenced a multitude of intellectual and spiritual landscapes. Thus, its inclusion as number five on this list reflects both its localized depth and its capacity to influence thought across the boundaries of culture and time.

### I Ching

The I Ching, also known as the Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text and a treasure of Eastern wisdom. Said to have been written over 3,000 years ago, its authorship is traditionally attributed to the Zhou dynasty sages, particularly King Wen and the Duke of Zhou. The depth of the I Ching is evident in its complex system of hexagrams, which serve as archetypal representations of situations and dynamics. This system has inspired various schools of thought in Confucianism and Taoism, and it underpins numerous aspects of Chinese metaphysics, cosmology, and philosophy. The text operates on multiple levels, serving as a guide for moral decision-making, a system for understanding the natural world, and a framework for the interpretation of events.

Regarding breadth, the I Ching's impact has been substantial, both within and beyond China's borders. It has not only shaped Chinese civilization over millennia but has also found a place in Western thought. The text has been translated into numerous languages, and its ideas have made their way into a variety of fields including philosophy, psychology, and even computer science. It serves as a bridge between disparate cultures and academic disciplines, thereby gaining a broad intellectual and spiritual footprint.

Spiritual Resonance is a compelling aspect of the I Ching. While initially rooted in a form of divination, its spiritual depth lies in its holistic worldview that seeks to harmonize human activity with the broader cosmic order. It emphasizes the need for balance, adaptability, and the following of a ‘middle way’ in all affairs. Whether used as a tool for personal introspection or as a philosophical treatise, the I Ching has the ability to connect with the individual on a deep spiritual level.

By these measures—its intricate and multilayered system, its expansive influence across various fields and cultures, and its profound spiritual resonance—the I Ching earns its place at number six on this list. While it may not have the mass appeal of some of the previously discussed religious texts, its significance is far from parochial; its wisdom has been and continues to be studied, applied, and revered across diverse cultures and eras.

### 7. The Dhammapada

The Dhammapada, an anthology of 423 verses, is one of the most widely read and best-known Buddhist scriptures. Originating in the Theravāda tradition, the text is attributed to Buddha and is regarded as a compilation of his sayings and teachings. Its depth lies in its distillation of complex Buddhist philosophies into accessible, practical wisdom that touches on moral ethics, mental training, and the path to Nirvana. The Dhammapada is so foundational to Buddhism that it has inspired commentaries, scholarly works, and adaptations in various languages and forms, serving as an introduction to Buddhist philosophy and ethics for laypeople and scholars alike.

In terms of breadth, the Dhammapada has influenced not just Buddhist cultures but has also penetrated Western thought. Its verses have been translated into numerous languages and have captivated a diverse array of thinkers. This scriptural anthology is not restricted to a particular time or culture; rather, it has universal appeal because it addresses the human condition and offers wisdom that is both timely and timeless.

The concept of Spiritual Resonance is exceptionally strong in the Dhammapada. It does not merely offer philosophical insight but aims to transform the inner world of the individual. Its verses are often used in personal and communal meditation, serving as mantras that are deeply internalized to nurture a sense of peace, compassion, and enlightenment. It brings together the cognitive and the experiential, aiming to produce not just intellectual understanding but spiritual realization.

Given these dimensions—its role as a cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy, its broad and enduring appeal across cultures, and its deep spiritual resonance—the Dhammapada stands as a monumental text in the spiritual and philosophical literature of humanity. While its roots are in Buddhist tradition, its wisdom is universal, appealing to anyone who seeks to understand the complexities of life and the pathways to spiritual enlightenment, earning it a place at number seven on this list. 

### 8. Plato's Dialogues 

Plato's Dialogues are a unique blend of philosophy, drama, and intellectual inquiry, capturing the essence of classical Greek thought while also laying the groundwork for Western philosophy and logic. Depth is readily apparent in these works; their topics range from politics and justice to beauty, love, and the nature of good and evil. Their dialectical approach has influenced countless fields, including political theory, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics. Moreover, the Socratic Method, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue, is foundational to contemporary pedagogy and discourse.

In terms of breadth, the Dialogues' impact is global and cross-cultural. Translated into virtually every major language, they are studied not just in philosophy courses but also in politics, literature, and religious studies. Their influence extends beyond academia into public policy and governance models. The Platonic ideals have found resonance in various forms of governance, law, and in theories of justice and equality.

Spiritual Resonance in Plato's Dialogues is often overlooked but is profoundly significant. The dialogues touch upon the metaphysical realms of the Forms, an abstract plane of perfect, immutable ideals that transcend the physical world. Plato's allegory of the cave is a deeply spiritual metaphor for enlightenment, the journey of the soul, and the transformative power of knowledge. Moreover, the concept of the Philosopher-King in "The Republic" evokes the wise, enlightened ruler who governs not for personal gain but for the higher ideals of justice and the common good.

The Platonic dialogues thus offer a comprehensive intellectual and spiritual framework for understanding the world and human behavior. They are among the few texts that not only pose questions but also continually refine the method of questioning itself. Through their depth in philosophical rigor, breadth across multiple domains of human inquiry, and spiritual resonance in questing for higher forms of reality, Plato’s Dialogues rightly occupy a distinguished place in the canon of humanity's most influential texts.

### 9. Works of Aristotle 

The oeuvre of Aristotle, the student of Plato, stands as a towering accomplishment in the annals of human thought. Aristotle's works are deeply foundational, providing the structure upon which various systems of knowledge have been built. The depth is particularly evident in how his contributions have spanned numerous disciplines—logic, biology, physics, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and rhetoric, to name just a few. His methodology, especially the concept of empirical observation and categorization, has been so deeply ingrained in Western thought that it is sometimes taken for granted. Works like "Nicomachean Ethics," "Politics," and "Metaphysics" have spawned not just commentaries but entire fields of study.

When considering breadth, Aristotle's works have a truly global reach and have been translated into multiple languages over millennia. They are foundational texts in the curricula of philosophy, political science, ethics, and theology, among others. Even scientific nomenclature, especially in biology and zoology, owes a debt to Aristotle’s system of classification. Furthermore, his works have played a significant role in Christian, Islamic, and Jewish scholastic traditions, demonstrating an interfaith influence that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries.

Spiritual Resonance might seem a less obvious dimension of Aristotle's works, but it is nonetheless significant. While Aristotle was more empirical and less metaphysical than Plato, his idea of the "Unmoved Mover" touches on the divine or transcendent principles that drive existence. Additionally, his ethics, especially the concept of eudaimonia or "flourishing," have a spiritual dimension, linking moral virtue to the ultimate well-being of the soul.

Combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, it is clear that Aristotle's works are monumental in their depth, covering a vast range of subjects with a methodology that has been foundational for subsequent intellectual endeavors. Their breadth is demonstrated by their far-reaching influence across disciplines, cultures, and religious traditions. Despite their analytical rigor, they also resonate with spiritual considerations of ethics, purpose, and the ultimate causes of life. For these reasons, the works of Aristotle undoubtedly merit a pivotal position in any list of canonical texts that have significantly shaped human history.

### 10. Upanishads

The Upanishads, ancient Sanskrit texts that form the core of Indian philosophical thought, have immense depth as they introduce seminal concepts like Brahman (the ultimate reality), Atman (the soul or self), and the complex interplay between them. These ideas have not only influenced subsequent Indian philosophy but have also been foundational to religious practices and spiritual orientations within Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Philosophers and theologians globally have engaged with these texts, extrapolating universal principles and ideas. The Upanishads are not merely philosophical treatises but are seen as direct revelations of ultimate truth, making them "sruti" or that which is heard.

In terms of breadth, the Upanishads have had an extensive influence, transcending their initial geographical and cultural milieu. In the modern era, their teachings have been globalized, impacting New Age spirituality, Western philosophy, and even scientific perspectives on consciousness.  Further, these scriptures are studied and revered not just within the Indian subcontinent but globally, among people interested in spirituality, philosophy, and metaphysics.

The concept of spiritual resonance in the Upanishads is almost axiomatic given their subject matter. These texts are not just reflective discourses but are experiential manuals that guide the seeker toward realizing Ultimate Reality. They deal with the deepest existential queries, offering a roadmap for spiritual awakening. They resonate with a thirst for a transcendental understanding of reality and a need for harmonizing the human experience with the cosmic order.

Integrating both qualitative and quantitative measures, the Upanishads score high on depth due to their foundational influence on entire systems of thought, both religious and philosophical. Their breadth is substantiated by their broad-ranging impact on global philosophy and spirituality over millennia. In the realm of spiritual resonance, they stand as some of the most potent texts ever written, delving into the mysteries of existence and offering pathways to spiritual enlightenment. Thus, the Upanishads deserve a place in any enumeration of canonical texts that have deeply and comprehensively influenced human history, and therefore close out our list at number ten.

## X. Indigenous Wisdom 

Indigenous Wisdom, despite its fragmented and localized nature, holds a certain canonical gravity that's both intriguing and enlightening, especially when seen through the lens of Depth, Breadth, and Spiritual Resonance. Its depth may not be cataloged in formalized texts or scriptures, but it is fully manifest in the lived experiences, rituals, and oral histories that have guided indigenous tribes and communities for millennia. These teachings have often been so foundational that they have influenced and informed many of the philosophical and religious systems that have attempted to more formally document Wisdom and Truth. After all, beneath the disconnections and abstractions, we all once came from a place, with each of our blended ancestral generations experiencing forms of local Wisdom, Knowledge and ignorance that have shaped who we each are today. 

In terms of breadth, Indigenous Wisdom's influence is increasingly stretching beyond the bounds of local communities to inform global dialogues on ecology, spirituality, and community-building. Once the only form of Wisdom and Knowledge, prior to libraries, canons, and empires, subsequently trampled on and squeezed out by more dominant, and often ignorant forces, it is reach is now reemerging on the other side of the crucible of history, still as alive, relevant, and immediately applicable as ever. Its once underappreciated insights into regenerative and communal living across generations are now recognized as invaluable for the future of the planet and humanity. While its geographical and temporal spread might not match the reach of more established canons, its rising prominence in interdisciplinary discussions across the globe speaks volumes, and if we would listen a little more carefully, we would discover that it still covers the earth.

However, it is perhaps in the realm of Spiritual Resonance that Indigenous Wisdom offers its most compelling canonical strength. Across diverse ecosystems and through varying cultural lenses, the wisdom transmitted by indigenous elders appears to be threaded by a form of universal insight. This insight, for lack of a better term, could be likened to Golden Threads of Divine Wisdom, subtly guiding humanity's spiritual evolution back towards the Source and Sustainer of Life. Worshipped and attested to by every rock, tree, and stream, even the seemingly inanimate aspects of Creation cry out, revealing the Wisdom and Logos of the Creator across Time and Space. 

The invitation before us is not merely to delve into the more formally known canonical texts, but to traverse our own ancestral lines and the unique-yet-universally-resonant Wisdom, Knowledge and Traditions that shaped them. These are not separate or conflicting quests, but are in fact deeply complementary as we navigate together towards Wisdom, Truth, Reconciliation, and At-One-Ment. As humanity moves towards an epoch where Wisdom, Truth, and a deeper understanding of God become increasingly sought after and existentially necessary, there is room for all to contribute to this grand tapestry of Wisdom and Knowledge that constitutes our Collective Inheritance. This isn't about establishing the supremacy of one canonical view over another; rather, it's about the harmonization of diverse Wisdom traditions under a New Covenant mediated directly by the Spirit of God within, present and available All who would turn, attend, and listen to the Divine Voice. This New Covenant is not simply an agreement recorded in ink or engraved in stone but is mediated by the living, active Spirit of God, wherein all of humanity who so desires can find unity, purpose, and a greater understanding of the Creator, One Another, and All Creation.

### Conclusion: The Living Canon of Transcendent Wisdom

To even approach the endeavor to delineate the ten most canonical texts in human history is a task of monumental proportions fraught with peril. This essay is not meant to be a definitive statement, but an invitation to dialogue and co-creation. It is not meant to weigh in on the Truth of validity of any particular document, but rather to state what actually is and has been in terms of influence and impact. Through a reasonably rigorous methodology accounting for depth, breadth, and spiritual resonance, we've navigated the rich tapestry of human wisdom, extracting those works that have not just stood the test of time but have molded the intellectual, cultural, and spiritual contours of civilizations. These texts, from the Bible to the Upanishads, embody the quintessential human quest for wisdom, meaning, and transcendence, each offering unique insights and approaches to life's most profound questions.

This list, while comprehensive in its assessment, is by no means exhaustive. The writings of Confucius, the teachings of the Buddha captured in the Pali Canon, the poetic justice of Shakespeare, and the incisive Enlightenment critique found in the works of Kant and Hume, and monumental touchstones such as the Summa of Aquinas, among others, all could be argued to hover near the top of the canonical echelons. Each of these has its own unique value and significance in terms of depth, breadth, and spiritual resonance, but falls short of surpassing the influence of those on this top-tier list. 

It is also essential to remember that canons are not static but dynamic entities. They breathe with the collective consciousness of the civilizations they influence and are, in turn, shaped by the ongoing dialogues they inspire. The power of these texts lies in their enduring ability to stimulate thought, elevate the spirit, and enrich culture, in old worlds and new. As much as they are the bedrock, they are also the living soil, from which new inquiries, ideologies, and spiritual pathways towards Justice, Realization, and Right Relationship can sprout.

In a world increasingly marked by ideological polarization and spiritual vacuity, these canonical texts serve as eternal wellsprings of wisdom, offering each seeker a chance to quench their insatiable thirst for Truth. They are not just the relics of bygone eras but are luminous bodies in the intellectual cosmos, shedding light on the path for those who tread on the winding roads of existential queries and spiritual pursuits.

By studying these texts, the scholar, the philosopher, and the spiritual seeker alike stand on the shoulders of giants, peering further into the mysteries of existence and the Divine, so long as they remain directly and personally guided by the Spirit of God, willing to follow the Golden Threads of Wisdom and Truth wherever they lead. We not only pay homage to the intellectual and spiritual achievements of our ancestors but also take up the mantle of responsibility to contribute to this ever-evolving, ever-resonant Meta-Canonical Wisdom that transcends time and space. Thus, this exploration, though detailed and comprehensive, is an invitation—an invitation to delve deeper, seek further, and add our own verses to the illuminating eternal song of Wisdom and Truth.

As a next step, we invite you, regardless of your background or belief, to begin the canonical Journey. Because the Abrahamic religions encompass over half of humanity and have had the broadest and deepest impact on the human species, it makes logical sense to begin there, starting with the apex of the canonical pyramid with the Bible. From there, one must trace back its roots in the Jewish tradition, as a necessary precursor to being able to understand and grapple with the Quran, which is a continuation and confirmation of the essence of the prior words of Jesus and the Prophets. One must then grapple with the apparent dichotomies and causes of strife between the Abrahamic family, while understanding the deep Vision and Hope found in the forward looking story of the Messiah, who fully embodies the Spirit of God, vanquishes corruption and injustice, wins the Spiritual War, and restores Righteousness and the Divine Order, right here on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

Having grappled then with the deepest and widest and stories that undergird western civilization and societies across the Middle East and Africa, we can turn next to the East, and delve into the foundational works that have shaped Eastern Society and Collective Consciousness. 

From there we can return to Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophical traditions that have so deeply shaped and informed thought across the West and East. 

Having grasped the East and West and their common threads, we may discover the Wisdom to attune our ears to quieter voices and traditions present around the world and in our own ancestries, so carelessly and ignorantly tread on and suppressed by unholy alliances of religion and empire over the centuries.

And finally, once we have learned to listen, from the loudest and strongest to the subtlest and meekest voices, we might become Wise and Blessed enough to rediscover in the Silence of our contemplation the Still Small Voice of God, whispering to us from within to arise, unite, and return. And on this epic Quest towards the Ultimate Unity of God through Love, we shall find One Another, streaming from every tribe, nation, and people around the world to the Sacred Mountain, that we might rediscover the Way and Knowledge of God. 

On that great and glorious New Day, when the shallow divisions have faded away and we worship together in the Spirit, Knowledge, Truth and Glory of God, we will understand why it has been said over and over again that the New World and Divine Order that All Creation longs and groans for is right here, at hand, reaching out to us, and waiting for us to reach back and grasp It, together. 

We look forward to seeing You on the Way towards The Goal.
