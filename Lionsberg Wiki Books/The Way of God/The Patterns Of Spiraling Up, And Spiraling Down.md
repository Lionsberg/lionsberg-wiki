# The Patterns Of Spiraling Up, And Spiraling Down

Let us see if we can *sense* and *feel* the *essence* of the [[Patterns]] that repeat themselves across [[Space]] and [[Time]]. 

They remain essentially the same. 

### Creation 

[[In The Beginning...]], God creates us and gives us Life. 

### The Creator's Will, Intention, and Desire 

[[God]] longs to be together with us, in unity, harmony, fulfillment and right relationship. 

### Spirit 

The Spirit of God lives within us, providing a direct personal connection to the Source and Sustainer of the Universe. 

This creates the Potential, and the Moral Imperative, for us to live by the Spirit, and co-operate as one [[Body of God]], each manifesting our unique gifts, talents, and calling to fulfill the Will and Intention of God. 

### Rules and Rituals 

The Spirit ends up speaking, and society ends up learning, and establishing [[Rules]] and [[Rituals]] meant to keep humanity in right relationship with God, One Another, and Nature. 

### The Way 

The Spirit, Rules, and Rituals of Society begin to constitute a [[Way of Being]] that harmonizes Society, Nature, and God. 

### Departure from the Way 

We depart from the Way, and as a consequence begin hurtling towards the generations of [[Pain]] and [[Suffering]] that accompany [[The Fall]]. 

### Progressive Estrangement 

We become progressively estranged from God, until after a [[Time]] we are *utterly* estranged from God. Utter estrangement, like [[Hell]], is the [[Limit Statement]] regarding what lies at the logical end of [[The Anti-Movement]]. 

[[Unity]] is what lies at the logical end of [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]] that leads towards [[Heaven]]. 

[[Utter Estrangement]] is what lies at the logical end of [[The Anti-Movement]] towards [[The Anti-Goal]] that leads towards [[Hell]].  

### Religious Corruption and Spiritual Bankruptcy

As we grow Progressively Estranged, our religious practices, rules, and rituals grow corrupt and devoid of the original Spirit and meaning. 

### Political Corruption 

The loss of the [[Central Animating Spirit]] of Society leads to corruption of the power structures. The corruption of the political and religious power structures corrupts and destabilizes society, as all start to witness the [[Bad Fruit]] and suffering flowing from the rotten roots. 

### Conflict, Division, Fear, Anxiety, Injustice 

*Because there is no longer anything uniting our spirit and consciousness,* estrangement from God produces *inevitable* conflict, division, fear, and anxiety, which lead to further corruption, injustice, oppression, and wrong relationship. 

### Perishing 

Without a Uniting Spirit, Intention, and Vision, we begin to experience all the symptoms of perishing. Both within, and as a consequence of the decay of society without. *Without a Vision, the people perish.*

### Prophesy and Promise 

The prophetic voice pierces the [[Darkness]], warning us of the error of our ways and the destruction that lies ahead, reassuring us of God's boundless Love and Desire for us, prophesying of the [[Better Future]] that is at hand, and imploring us to turn and Attend to the Word of God, and progress back towards the Ultimate Unity of God through Love. 

### Return

When the suffering gets bad enough, and the prophetic voice gets loud enough, the people return to God, the [[Spiral Downward]] towards [[Hell]] ceases, and the [[Spiral Upward]] towards [[Heaven]] begins.

### The Exodus

This [[Spiral Upward]] is at odds with the [[Old World]], and requires an Exodus FROM [[The Old]] TO [[The New]]. 

### The New World

On the other side of [[The Wilderness]] that separates the [[Old]] from the [[New]] lies the [[New World]]
