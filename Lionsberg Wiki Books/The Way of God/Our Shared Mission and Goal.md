# Our Shared Mission and Goal

Once we understand that we are not separate from, but contained within, a [[Living System]] encompassing the [[Universe]] whose subsequent transformations across [[SpaceTime]] are being guided by [[God]], and once we grasp the interexistence of [[All]] [[Creation]] animated by the permeating and sustaining [[Spirit of God]], and once we make the [[Conscious Decision]] to place [[God]] at [[The Center]], we come to realize that we are [[All]] a part of One [[Universal Body]] of [[Creation]], being guided by [[God]] towards our shared [[Destiny]]. 

Once this epiphany occurs, we begin to understand that our [[Highest Identity]] is not as individuals, but as One [[Spiritual Body]], flowing from, being sustained by, and returning to the [[Creator]] of our existence. 

Once this epiphany occurs, "we" becomes [[We]], and [[We]] understand that [[We]] are [[All]] here on [[Worksite Earth]] for a single unifying [[Purpose]] and [[Goal]]. 

On a worksite other than Earth, such as a roadway, reservoir, or bridge, what unites all the workers, the common mission and goal, is to bring the [[Designer's Intent]] into [[Reality]]. 

On the Universal Worksite, or on [[Worksite Earth]] as a subset, what unites [[All]] the workers, the common mission and goal, is to bring the [[Creator's Intent]] into [[Reality]]. 

Our [[Supreme Goal]] becomes [[God]], and our [[Work]] becomes [[Co-Creation]]. 

As we labor together, with [[One Another]] and [[God]], there is no debate as to what the [[Mission]] and [[Supreme Goal]] is. It is to accomplish the [[Will]] and [[Intention]] of [[God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

It is, as it were, to bring [[Heaven]] to [[Earth]]. To cause the [[Creator's Intent]] to be fully [[Manifest]] and made [[Known]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

One [[Word Tool]] we can use to describe this [[Reality]] is the [[Kingdom Of God]]. We can known the extent and boundaries of a Kingdom by where the Authority and Intention of the king prevails and is done. 

Upon the epiphany of our interexistence and inherent unity as One [[Family of God]], our shared [[Vision]], [[Mission]], and [[Goal]] becomes very simply the [[Kingdom Of God]], [[On Earth As it Is In Heaven]]. 

Our [[Work]] becomes the the most meaningful and purposeful endeavor imaginable - partnering with the [[Creator]] of the Universe to [[Co-Create]] the kind of [[Reality]] the [[Creator]] Intends for us to flourish together within.
