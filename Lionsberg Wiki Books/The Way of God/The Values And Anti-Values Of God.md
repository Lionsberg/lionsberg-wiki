# The Values And Anti-Values Of God

If we are to reunite our [[Selves]] to [[God]], we must learn to [[Value]] and [[Embody]] what God [[Values]], and to not Value or Embody what God does not Value. 

### What God Does Not Value

As the opening chapters continue, we begin to get a sense for what [[God]] truly values, and does not value. 

One thing that God does not value is empty and performative religion. 

"*What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings...*"

*“When you come to appear before me, who has required of you
this **trampling of my courts**?
Bring no more **vain offerings**;
**incense** is an abomination to me.
**New moon and Sabbath** and the calling of **convocations**— I cannot endure **iniquity** and solemn assembly. Your new moons and your **appointed feasts** my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them."*

Here we see God tired of performative religion, ceremonies, offerings, and feasts by a people whose hearts are far from God. 

### What God Values

Next, we begin to see articulated the essence of what God truly values and desires: right heart, right action, and right relationship, mediated by the Spirit and now by the Law: 

*"Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean"
"Remove the evil of your deeds"
"cease to do evil"
"learn to do good"
"seek justice"
"correct oppression"
"bring justice to the fatherless"
"plead the widow's cause"*

## The Good and the Anti-Good

We can then begin to derive the relative [[Value]], or [[Goodness]], of each potential [[Way of Being]], and begin to Progressively Articulate the things that are God Values, and which are therefore [[Good]], and the things that God Does Not Value, which are therefore [[Anti-Good]]. 

## What Is Wise, Right, and Good? 

In scripture, [[God]] is described as a consuming fire. Isaiah asks the [[Profound Question]]: *"Who among us can dwell with the consuming fire?"*

Here are some [[Word Tools]] from Isaiah that point at the Wise, the Right, and the Good: 

*Truth
Love 
Justice  
Intercession  
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean   
Remove the evil of your deeds  
Cease to do evil  
Learn to do good

Correct oppression  
Bring justice to the fatherless  
Plead the widow's cause   
Righteousness  
Faithfulness  
Full of Justice   
Firm in Faith  
Returning  
Resting  
Quietness  
Trust  
Abundance 
Salvation

Faithfully Bringing Forth Justice 
Judging the Poor with Righteousness  
Deciding with Equity for the Meek of the Earth  
Bringing Prisoners out from the Dungeon 
Opening the Eyes that are Blind  
Opening the Ears that are Deaf  
Not judging by what eyes see, nor deciding disputes by what ears hear  
The Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding  
The Spirit of Council and Might  
Striking the Earth with the rod of the mouth, and with breath slaying the wicked  
Loosing the bonds of wickedness  
Undoing the straps of the yoke  
Letting the oppressed go free  
Breaking every yoke  
Sharing your bread with the hungry  
Bringing the homeless poor into your house  
Covering the naked  
Removing from your midst the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and the speaking of wickedness  
Pouring yourself out for the hungry  
Satisfying the desire of the afflicted  
Calling the sabbath a delight, and the Holy Day honorable  
Not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly  
Going before the law with honesty and justice 
Looking to God  
Consulting the LORD  
Regarding God over man  
Regarding Spirit over flesh  
Planning and standing upon Noble Things  
Keeping the sabbath 
Keeping your hand from doing any evil  
Putting on Righteousness as a breastplate  
Putting on Salvation as a helmet  
Putting on Zeal as a cloak  
Putting on Garments of salvation  
Putting on a robe of righteousness 
Joyfully working righteousness  
Being humble and contrite in spirit  
Trembling at the Word of God  

This list of what is Wise, Right and Good could stretch out the heavens, encompassing every potential situation, problem, opportunity, and need. However in the [[New Covenant]], it is not the [[Rules]] or [[The Law]] that reigns, but the [[Spirit]]. 

Elsewhere in Scripture, the long lists are simplified. For example: 

*He has shown thee, O man, what is Good and what the LORD requires of thee: but to Do Justly, and to Love Mercy, and to Walk Humbly With Thy God.*

Can the [[Spirit]] within you *feel* how that simple statements encompasses the entire list above, and how if you truly understood Justice, Mercy, and Humbly Walking With God, you would naturally do everything described above? 

Or again: 

*You shall Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as your Self. On these two commandments hang all [[The Law]] and [[The Prophets]].*

Can the [[Spirit]] within you *sense* how if you truly understood what it was to [[Love]] God, to Love your Self, and to Love those around you, you would naturally and spontaneously do all the Wise, Right, and Good things listed above? 

## What Is Anti-Good?

Once we understand the [[Spirit]] and [[Values]] of [[God]], we do not even need to list out the [[Anti-Good]], for we already know in our Spirit what it is. 

If we know that the entire [[Universal Law]] is summed up by omni-directional [[Love]], then we naturally know that we cannot do anything insincerely, or anything that would harm rather than help Creation. 

Here are some words from Isaiah on things that God does not Value:

*Joining house to house, and field to field, until there is no more room*  
*Running after strong drink, and being inflamed with wine*  
*Not regarding the work of the LORD, or seeing the work of His hands*  
*Calling evil good, and good evil*  
*Those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight*  
*Those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant in mixing strong drink*  
*Those who acquit the guilty of a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right*  
*Rejecting the Law of the LORD*  
*Despising the Word of the Holy One*  
*Decreeing iniquitous decrees*  
*Writing oppression*  
*Robbing the poor people of their right*  
*Making widows their spoil, and the fatherless their prey*  
*Inquiring of idols, sorcerers, mediums, and necromancers*  

Beneath the articulated list, that could be expanded into a thousand other like things, can the [[Spirit]] within you *feel* what is [[Wrong]] or [[Anti-Good]] about these things? Can you *sense* and [[Discern]] what is the spirit or essence that is characteristic of each item on this list, that unites them and makes them [[Anti-Good]]?
