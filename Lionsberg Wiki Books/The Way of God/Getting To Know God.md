# Getting To Know God

As we [[Progressively Realize]] our interexistence and unity with [[One Another]] and [[God]], we discover that the [[Absolute]] [[Deepest]] desire in our [[Heart]] is to [[Know]] and [[Love]] [[God]]. 

Just as in any relationship, to [[Progress]] into every deeper intimacy and intercourse with [[God]], we must get to [[Know God]]. 

The best [[Way]] to get to [[Know God]] is to discover the inner [[Silence]] that allows us to hear His Word. There is no substitute for direct [[Dialogue]] with the [[Divine]]. 

However this inner [[Sanctuary]] takes Time, Discipline, Practice, and Focus to cultivate. It's doors are unlocked and its riches bestowed by the [[Spirit of God]] in direct proportion to the degree to which our [[Spirit]] is being United to God. 

As we learn to cultivate the [[Silence]] and hear the [[Word of God]], we also begin to get to [[Know God]] by reading  and listening to the [[Word of God]] as it has been discerned and spoken by those who have gone before us. 

To get to know God, we begin by listening to His Voice, as directly and personally and without mediation as possible. 

Because the [[Spirit of God]] is within us, [[Communion]] with [[God]] is not subject to the mediation or authority of pastors, priests, or gurus. 

And yet, if we were training to be [[Martial Arts]] masters, we would be foolish not to study and absorb as much as we could from the most widely respected and revered [[Masters]] who have gone before. And until we reached [[Mastery]] our [[Selves]], say after 15 years of intense study and external validation of our [[Progress]] and achievements, we would be exceedingly foolish to stray from the [[Straight And Narrow]] [[Path]] carved over the millennia by the [[Masters]]. 

In the [[Martial Arts]], when one is learning the [[Way]], there is a concept called Shu, Ha, and Ri. 

Shu, Ha, and Ri relate to levels of [[Mastery]] in a learning system designed to transmit a [[Way]]. 

[[Shu]] is the level of the beginner. In the beginning, one must follow the teachings of the [[Teacher]] exactly. It is often called [[Follow Me Form]]. Do not ask questions. Do not attempt to improvise. Only attempt to do exactly what the Master says to do and does. 

[[Ha]] is the level of the intermediate. At this level, the [[Learner]] begins to intuit and see how the patterns interrelate, and sense the [[Deeper]] hidden principles and synergies. They begin to articulate and propose their own [[Understanding]] of the [[Art And Science]] of the [[Way]] they are learning, and this level often takes them up to their first, second, or third degree blackbelts. At this level, it is very tempting for the [[Learner]] to break away too soon, to arrogantly believe they [[Know]], and begin to do things their own way. They are learning to question. They are beginning to see the oversimplifications and cracks in the elementary teachings and forms. However they do not yet Know the answers. 

Ri is the level of [[Mastery]], through which one discovers that in order to actually embody the [[Spirit]] of the [[Way]], one must continually [[Break The Rules In Order To Do What Is Right]]. 

From a religious lens, this level of [[Mastery]] can be witnessed repeatedly through the stories of [[Jesus]], who constantly violated the strict rules and teachings of the religious order of his day in order to manifest [[Wise Right]] thought, words, and action intuitively from the [[Spirit of God]]. 

Shu and Ha speak to [[The Letter Of The Law]]. 

Ri speaks to [[The Spirit Of The Law]].  

So let us, the humble Learners, turn to the [[Masters]] of the [[Way]] of [[God]], and give our attention to [[The Prophets]].
