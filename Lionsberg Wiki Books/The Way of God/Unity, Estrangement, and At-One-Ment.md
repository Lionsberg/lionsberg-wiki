# Unity, Estrangement, and At-One-Ment

A step forward on our [[Path]] into verse two reveals the opening essence of the [[Vision]] - [[God]] longing for [[Reunion]] with His Children, who have rejected Him. 

*"Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the [[LORD]] has spoken:
“Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib,
but Israel does not know, my people do not [[Understand]].”*

Because the [[Spirit of God]] is unchanging, we can hear, *feel*, and illuminate the same underlying *intention* and *desire* through other scripture, such as the prophetic words of [[Jesus]] speaking to [[Israel]] from God: 

*"'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling."*  

Separated by centuries, the voice of Jesus reverberates and harmonizes with the voice of Isaiah, because they are inspired by and flowing from the same unchanging [[Spirit]]. 

The opening setting is one of estrangement, and desire for [[Reconciliation]] and [[At-One-Ment]]. 

*"Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers,
children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD,
they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are **utterly estranged**."*

As we get to [[Know God]], we should discover that the word [[LORD]] in all capitals in scripture is the English translation of the the Hebrew tetragrammaton, usually transliterated as YHWH, the proper name for [[God]] in the Jewish Torah. Because many Jewish people hold the name of [[God]] as too sacred to speak, it is often replaced in speech with [[HaShem]] (literally, The Name). 

The many "names of God" describe many aspects of the [[Absolute]], and point back to the [[One]] [[Ultimate Reality]] - the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe, Who guides the subsequent transformations of Reality over Time. 

The basic spiritual impulse, or [[Spiritual Element]] in the universe, manifests in the deep desire for [[Progress]] towards [[Unity]] through [[Love]]. The progression towards Unity through [[Love]] is the polar opposite movement of *estrangement.* The essence of the [[Way]] is [[The Movement]] of [[All Creation]] *towards* its [[Source]]. The essence of [[The Anti-Movement]] is the divisive movement away from [[Unity]], towards [[Estrangement]]. 

[[The Anti-Movement]] towards [[The Anti-Goal]] can perhaps be conceptually thought of as [[Entropy]]. 

[[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]] can be conceptually thought of as the [[Anti-Entropic]] force of the universe, which is associated with the working of [[God]]. 

Here, we see Israel in a state of *utter estrangement* - the exact opposite of the Will and Intention of God. If the Goal of God is for us [[All]] to be [[United As One]] in [[Harmony]], [[Right Relationship]], and [[Shalom]], [[The Anti-Goal]] is the state of utter and complete [[Estrangement]]. 

Utter Estrangement is the [[State of Being]] that lies at the logical end of [[The Anti-Movement]]. 

*"Why will you still be struck down?
Why will you continue to rebel?
The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it..."*

Any parent understands the pain of watching a child inflict suffering upon themselves because of their sheer foolishness and rebellion against the [[Wisdom, Principles, and Values]] that would cause them to [[Progress]] towards the fullness of their [[Potential]] and flourish. 

Here, "*Why will you still be struck down*" speaks to the inevitable fall and destruction that lies at the end of their current trajectory. Those who willfully and utterly estrange them selves from [[God]] are always eventually struck down. [[Pride]], the [[Sin]] that separates us from [[God]], always comes before [[The Fall]]. 

Next, is the call to [[Attention]]: 

*"Hear the word of the [[LORD]]..."
"Give ear to the teaching of our [[God]]..."*

It is the [[Knowledge of God]], that comes as a result of attending to and hearing the [[Word of God]], that marks the [[Way]] towards [[At-One-Ment]].
