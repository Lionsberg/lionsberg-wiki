# The Case Study Of Jerusalem

Here, the [[Spirit of God]] through [[Isaiah]] lambasts the city of [[Jerusalem]], the destined capital of [[Israel]]: 

*"How the **faithful** city
has become a **whore**,
she who was full of **justice**!
**Righteousness** lodged in her,
but now **murderers**.
Your silver has become **dross**,
your best wine **mixed with water**.
Your princes are **rebels**
and companions of **thieves**.
Everyone loves a **bribe**
and runs after **gifts**.
They do not bring **justice to the fatherless**,
and **the widow's cause** does not come to them."*

This presents a case study of the essence of what [[God]] finds [[Wrong]] with a Society. 

God desires: 
- [[Faithfulness]]  
- [[Justice]]  
- [[Righteousness]]  

Society descends towards: 
- Unfaithfulness  
- Murder  
- Decay  
- Dilution  
- Rebels  
- Thieves  
- Bribes  
- Injustice  

Through this case study and so many others in Scripture, the [[Pattern Language]] of the [[Kingdom of God]] begins to become clear.
