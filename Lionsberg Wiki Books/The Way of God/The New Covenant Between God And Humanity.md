# The New Covenant Between God And Humanity

*And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD: “My Spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children's offspring,” says the LORD, “from this time forth and forevermore.”*

The essence of the [[New Covenant]] that [[God]] desires with humanity is one mediated by the [[Spirit]] and [[Knowledge of God]]. God has blessed us with the [[Spirit]], and placed the [[Word of God]] in our mouths, and this [[Logos]] is to be eternally upheld, honored, bound around our hearts and our necks, and spoken throughout the generations. 

***If*** we abide by this [[New Covenant]], ***then*** we will be blessed, and the righteous shall inherit the Earth. 

It is the only [[Way]].
