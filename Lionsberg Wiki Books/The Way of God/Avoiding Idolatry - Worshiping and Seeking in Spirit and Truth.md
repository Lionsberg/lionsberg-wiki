# Avoiding Idolatry - Worshiping and Seeking in Spirit and Truth

Back to the speech on Mars Hill, the Apostle Paul delivers a poignant message to the Athenians, cautioning against idolatry. The Apostle makes it clear: we ought not to confine our understanding of the Divine Nature to material or conceptual idols, or confuse them with Ultimate Reality. These "idols" could range from physical statues crafted from gold or stone to the semantic constructs or theological doctrines etched onto paper or impressed upon minds.

This idea of idolatry isn't restricted merely to the domain of religious artifacts sculpted in stone or metal; it equally applies to the semantic propositions, theologies, or philosophies crafted by human intellect and sculpted through words. Both are feeble human attempts to encapsulate the ineffable Divine Nature into manageable, comprehensible categories or items. They invariably fall woefully short.

God, as Spirit and Source, transcends all such attempts at categorization or description. The Divine is ineffable and inexhaustible, beyond human comprehension but intimately Knowable at the core of our being. Just as a statue or a thousand written statements about a person cannot begin to capture their infinite, unique essence, words or doctrines about God are but pointers or icons, sacred tools that guide us toward the Ultimate Reality, which animates all existence.

In this regard, idolatry becomes a misplaced focus on the physical or semantic mediums through which we attempt to understand or connect with the Divine. It is the act of mistaking the map for the terrain, the symbol for the reality, the word for the Word. The antidote to such idolatry is to cultivate a direct personal relationship with God that transcends these mediums, to worship in Spirit and Truth. This requires us to be ever-vigilant and discerning, ensuring that our word tools, doctrines, and rituals serve not as ends in themselves but as means to guide us toward the Ultimate Beginning, End, and Goal, via profound, direct personal experience of God.

In this delicate balance between the tangible and the ineffable, between human constructs and Divine Reality, lies the journey toward true spiritual enlightenment. It's a journey marked not by the acquisition of more sophisticated tools, doctrines, or rituals, but by the progressive unveiling of the Kingdom, Will, and Intention of God, "on Earth as it is in Heaven," through lives lived in alignment with universal and eternal Wisdom, Principles, and Values.

So, as we navigate the complex pathways of human language, thought, and culture, the guiding light in our Quest should always be to align our lives and practices in Worship by the Spirit, the Word, and the Truth. In doing so, we can avoid the pitfalls that lie along the Way and progressively reveal the Divine in our daily lives, enriching ourselves and the world around us.
