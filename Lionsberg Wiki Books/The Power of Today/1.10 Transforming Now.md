# 1.10 Transforming Now
This same logic is equally true for any period of [[Time]]. Including the infinitely small yet eternal [[Now]]. 

We cannot live in yesterday, and We cannot live in tomorrow. 

We cannot live in the last microsecond, and We cannot live in the next microsecond. 

All We ever have is [[Now]]. 

And every [[Now]], like every Day, transforms Us. 

Each of the trillions of microseconds of [Now] We exist through transform Us. 

Every instance of [Now] transforms the product of the previous instance of [Now]. 

A life well lived is one in which [Now] is well lived. 

A great life is composed of great [Nows].
