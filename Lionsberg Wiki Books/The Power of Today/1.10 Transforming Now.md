# 1.10 Transforming Now
This same logic is equally true for any period of [[Time]]. Including the infinitely small yet eternal [[Now]].  

We cannot live in yesterday, and We cannot live in tomorrow.  

We cannot live in the last microsecond, and We cannot live in the next microsecond.  

All We ever have is [[Now]].  

And every [[Now]], like every Day, transforms Us.  

Each of the trillions of microseconds of [[Now]] We exist through transform Us.  

Every instance of [[Now]] transforms the product of the previous instance of [[Now]].  

A life well lived is one in which [[Now]] is well lived.  

A great life is composed of great Nows.
