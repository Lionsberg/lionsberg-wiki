# 2.9 Throughput
All of these elements, and the many others We are still in the process of [[Realize|Realizing]], work together to transform Us into a sort of conduit through which That Which is of Greatest Worth in-breaks into [[Reality]]. 

As the [[New]] [[Inbreak|Inbreaks]], it displaces the [[Old]]. 

There is both a [[Quality]] and a [[Quantity]] to the [[Value]] that is [[Flow|Flowing]] through us. 

If we view our lives like a [[System]], it is the rate of [[Throughput]] of Our [[Goal]]. 

If we view our lives like a [[Quest]], it is something like the rate of [[Progress]] towards Our [[Goal]]. 

The gifts that We are giving You are immensely powerful. They will prgressively transform You into a far more powerful, capable, and dangerous Being. 

It is absolutely critical, and of utmost importance, that You VERY CAREFULLY choose Your [[Aim]], and ensure that it is [[Good]]. 

Just like You never point a gun at something You are unwilling to shoot, NEVER point this System at something You are not willing to see become Your lived [[Reality]].
