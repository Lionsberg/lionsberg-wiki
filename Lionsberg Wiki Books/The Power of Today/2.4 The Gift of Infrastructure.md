# 2.4 The Gift of Infrstructure
We would also like to offer You the gift of Infrastructure, which [[All]] members of the [[Community]] are free to use, provided that they contribute to it, maintain it, and leave it better than they found it. 

It may not be much, but We are adding to it every day. 

Recognizing that billions will follow after us in the [[Way]], there is an ethical imperative to do the dangerous and hard work of building the roadways and bridges our [[Selves]], that make it safer and easier for [[All]] who come after us. #principle 

If it is not useful to You, do not use it. If it is helpful to You, it is a free gift.
