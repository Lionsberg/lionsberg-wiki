# 2.7 The Gift of a Practice
Our next offering to You is the gift of a [[Practice]]. 

Realizing Your Potential takes [[Discipline]]. 

It takes [[Practice]]. 

It takes Training. 

It takes hard work. 

Those who have travelled farthest along the [[Way]] have invariably [[Embody|Embodied]] a [[Practice]] that _caused_ them to reach the heights that they did. 

A [[Practice]] is what connects the [[Idea]] and [[Philosophy]] down to the ground of [[Reality]]. 

It is the mechanics of [[How]] the Idea is lived out. 

It is the element of disciplined application present in the [[Way]]. 

If you have not deeply studied, tested, and lived an effective daily [[Practice]] of Your Own, We offer You one as a gift. 

It is a starting point that is gauranteed to elevate and transform You and Your Life.
