# 2.7 The Gift of a Practice
Our next offering to You is the gift of a [[Practice]]. 

Realizing Your Potential takes [[Discipline]].  

It takes [[Practice]].  

It takes Training. 

It takes hard work.  

Those who have travelled farthest along the [[Way]] have invariably [[Embody|Embodied]] a [[Practice]] that _caused_ them to reach the heights that they did.  

A [[Practice]] is what connects the [[Idea]] and [[Philosophy]] down to the ground of [[Reality]].  

It is the mechanics of [[How]] the Idea is lived out.  

It is the element of disciplined application present in the [[Way]].  

If you have not deeply studied, tested, and lived an effective daily [[Practice]] of Your Own, We offer You one as a gift.  

It is a starting point that is absolutely guaranteed to elevate and transform You and Your Life.
