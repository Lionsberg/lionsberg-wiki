# 2.5 The Gift of Structure

Next, We offer You the gift of [[Structure]]. 

You will notice that [[All]] [[Life]] emerges within and upon [[Structure]]. 

You may already have adequate Structure to facilitate Your progress towards the Goal. 

However if it is useful to You, We have gone to great lengths to design and build a Structure that is purpose-built to help You progress along Your [[Way]].  

The [[Structure]] houses and [[Stewardship|Stewards]] the [[Infrastructure]] and [[Tools]] We are co-creating to [[Help One Another]] [[Progress]].  

Along with the [[Community]], it also provides an identifiable and concrete [[Place of Practice]] where We can work together towards the [[One Thing]] that unites Us All.  

The Structure can be found at [[LIONSBERG]].
