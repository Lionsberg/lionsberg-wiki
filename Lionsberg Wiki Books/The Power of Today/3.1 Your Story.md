# 3.1 Your Story
There is something very strange about Your Story.  

And that is that it is _uniquely Yours_.  

Like your fingerprints, no other being on earth shares an exact match.  

It warrants thinking about this for a lifetime.  

Your [[Perception]] of [[Reality]] is fundamentally structured by a unique Story that no one else shares.  

Worse yet, when We were imprisoned in [[The Caves]] We were entirely unconscious of the Story We were repeating. 

This means that every human [[Being]] Perceives Reality in a unique way that no one else can.  

The first thing We need to do, in order to set Our Selves up to be able to [[Perceive]] [[Reality]] properly, is to bring Our Story to light.  

 To delve into the depths of our Conscious / Subconscious / Unconscious [[Mind|Minds]], and to draw it up out of the infinite well.
