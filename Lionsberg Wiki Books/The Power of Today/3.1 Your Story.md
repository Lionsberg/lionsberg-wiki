# 3.1 Your Story
There is something very stange about Your Story. 

And that is that it is _uniquely Yours_.

Like your fingerprints, no other being on earth shares an exact match. 

It warrants thinking about this for a lifetime. 

Your Perception of [[Reality]] is fundamentally structured by a unique Story that no one else shares. 

Worse yet, when We were back in the [[Caves]] We were entirely unconscious of the Story We were repeating (the Caves is a concept from [[The Book of Lionsberg]] - see [[1.5 The Caves]]).

This means that every human [[Being]] Perceives Reality in a unique way that no one else can. 

The first thing We need to do, in order to set Our Selves up to be able to [[Perceive]] [[Reality]] properly, is to bring Our Story to light. 

 To delve into the depths of our Conscious / Subconscious / Unconscious [[Mind|Minds]], and to draw it up out of the infinite well.
