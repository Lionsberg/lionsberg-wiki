# 1.4 Your Way

This Guide is written to help You make _the_ [[Way]] _Your_ [[Way]]. 

The [[Way]] You express the [[Way]] will be unique and different from any other expression of the [[Way]], because _You_ are unique and different from every other expression of humanity. 

It is precisely the diversity of instruments that makes the [[Potential]] universal [[Symphony]] so awe-inspiring. 

A [[Symphony]] is not a [[Symphony]] is the entire orchestra is playing the same instrument. 

Let Us discover [[Who You Are]]. 

Let Us uncover and examine the unique instrument that the  [[One]] fashioned You to be and gave you to [[Play]]. 

Let Us tune it up, and align it with the [[Fundamental Tone]]. 

Let Us teach One Another how to [[Play]].  

Let Us [[Help One Another]] remember how to Harmonize Our Selves with [[One Another]], [[One]] and [[All]]. 

Let Us learn the songs of Heaven. 

Let Us [[Progressively Realize]] the [[New Song]].  

Let Us join together in the [[Eternal]] and [[Universal]] [[Symphony]] of [[Life]] and [[Consciousness]]. 

One by one, let Us bring all the unique instruments of the universe into [[Harmony]], so we can all bask in the vibrant symphony of [[Heaven On Earth]].
