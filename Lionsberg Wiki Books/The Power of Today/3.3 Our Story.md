# 3.3 Our Story
We have discussed Your Story, and the Meta Story. 

The third element is Our Story. 

What is the Story You are telling Your Self about Us? 

Who do You think We Are? 

What % of Our Story do You think You Know? 

What % of [[Who We Are]] and [[Where We Are Going]] do You think You have seen and grasped? 

[[Why]] do You think We are doing what We are doing? 

What Story do You think We are telling Our Selves about You? 

We are offering to help You across a chasm You cannot cross alone. 

And We are asking for Your help to do what We cannot do alone. 

Can You trust Us? 

Who Are We? 

Are You part of Us? 

Are You one of Us? 

Are You one with Us? 

Are We one?
