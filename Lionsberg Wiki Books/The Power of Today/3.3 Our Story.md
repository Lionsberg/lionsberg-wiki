# 3.3 Our Story

We have discussed Your Story, and the Meta Story. 

The third element is Our Story.  

Our Story is about who we are becoming together. 

Who do You think We Are?  

Why do You think We Are here together?

Why? 

How does the thread of Your unique and beautiful story contribute to the vibrancy and coherence of the our collective tapestry of stories?
