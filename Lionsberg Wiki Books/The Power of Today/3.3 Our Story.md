# 3.3 Our Story

We have discussed Your Story, and the Meta Story. 

The third element is Our Story.  

Our Story is about who we are becoming together. 

Who do You think We Are?  

Why do You think We Are here together? 

Where do you think we are going? 

Why? 

How does the thread of Your unique and beautiful story contribute to the vibrancy and coherence of Our collective tapestry of stories? 

Most importantly, who are We? Who is Us? How big is Your present conception of Our Ultimate Unity with One and All?
