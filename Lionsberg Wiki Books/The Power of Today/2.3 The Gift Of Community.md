# 2.3 The Gift Of Community
One of the first gifts We would like to offer You is the gift of [[Community]]. 

If it is not already apparent to You, it will soon become obvious that You cannot get to [[Where We Are Going]] alone. It is simply and logically not possible. 

In order for You to exist in Your [[Destiny]], We must exist in Our [[Destiny]], [[All]] must exist in their [[Destiny]], and those Destinies must All be One. 

As a provisional measure, in case You do not already have a living, vibrant, active [[Community]] helping You arise, transform, and become the fullness of who You are uniquely created to be, We have created one. 

It is called Lionsberg. 

Welcome.
