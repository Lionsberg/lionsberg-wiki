# 3.0 Story
There is a Story that We tell Our Selves about [[Who We Are]], [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]]. 

This narrative framework structures our [[Perceive|Perception]] of [[Reality]]. 

It feels strange to Us to say something so lightly and simply that is so important. 

So let Us repeat: this [[Narrative Framework]] is what fundamentally structures Our Perception of Reality. 

It comes even before what We See, because it determines, out of the infinite number of things We could [[Attend]] to, what We _actually_ [[Attend]] to. 

There are three basic elements to the Story: 
1. Your Story
2. Our Story
3. The Meta Story

The Story We tell Our Selves about each of these will determine what We See and Do Today. It will determine [[Who We Are]], and who We [[Become]]. 

Therefore the first Discipline of Your New Practice is to pay [[Attention]] to Your Story.
