# 3.0 Story

There is a Story that We tell Our Selves about [[Who We Are]], [[Where We Are]], [[How We Got Here]], [[Where We Are Going]], and [[Why]].  

This narrative framework structures our [[Perceive|Perception]] of [[Reality]].  

It feels strange to Us to say something so lightly and simply that is so important.  

So let Us repeat: this [[Narrative Framework]] is what fundamentally structures Our Perception of Reality.  

It comes even before what We See, because it determines, out of the infinite number of things We could [[Attend]] to, what We _actually_ [[Attend]] to.  

The Stories we tell our Selves literally determine what We See and Do Today. They determine [[Who We Are]], and who We [[Become]]. 

Therefore the first [[Discipline]] of Your New Practice is to pay [[Attention]] to [[Your Story]], and progressively articulate it, bring it out of the darkness and into the Light, and make the unseen seen.
