# 2.8 The Gift of an Integrated System
Next We offer You the gift of an [[Integrated]] [[System of Systems]]. 

The various elements and gifts are all individually valuable. 

However they transmute into something infinitely more valuable if they are applied together as an Integrated System. 

This is not just any System. 

It is a magically powerful tool purpose-built to _pull_ the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] into [[Reality]]. 

It is a Machine built to bring [[Intention Into Reality]].

The unique magic of the System is that it forges out of [[All]] things a Unity of the highest Order. 

You may already have Integrated a better System, however if you have not We offer it to You as a free gift in the Spirit of Love.
