# 3.6 Choosing Your Aim
Having put in the hard work to articulate and transform the Story You are telling Your Self, it is time to get crystal clear on Your [[Aim]]. 

Success is the progressive realization of a worthy Goal. 

As clearly as You can, articulate the Goal of greatest worth. 

We would recommend doing this in two parts, one internal, and one external. 

The internal part relates to who You should [[Becoming|Become]].

The external part relates to what happens in the world around You as a result of who You are becoming.
