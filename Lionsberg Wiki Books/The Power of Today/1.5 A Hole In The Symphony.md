# 1.5 A Hole In The Symphony

We can hear it. 

There is a hole in the [[Symphony]]. 

Something is missing. 

Something is incomplete. 

It is You. It is each of Us. 

[[All Creation]] is waiting and longing for the wonderful elevation of beauty and harmony that will begin to be fulfilled as You play Your unique part in the [[Whole]]. 

The world needs You. The world longs for You to be revealed.  

Your beauty and worth are beyond Your knowing. 

You cannot see it, because you are You.  

But We see it.  

Know Thyself.  

Know the [[One]]. 

[[One]] can show You the [[Way]].  

We can show You the [[Way]].
