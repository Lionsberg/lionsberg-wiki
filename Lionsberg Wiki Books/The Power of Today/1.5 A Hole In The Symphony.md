# 1.5 A Hole In The Symphony
We can hear it. 

There is a hole in the [[Symphony]]. 

Something is missing. 

Something is incomplete. 

It is You. 

All creation is waiting and longing for the wonderful elevation of beauty and harmony that will begin to be fulfilled as You play Your unique part in the Whole. 

The world needs You. The world long for You. 

Your beauty and worth are beyond Your knowing. 

You cannot see it, because you are You. 

But We see it. 

Know Thyself. 

We can help You. 

We can show You the [[Way]].
