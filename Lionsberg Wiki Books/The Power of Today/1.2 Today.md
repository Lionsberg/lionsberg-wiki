# 1.2 Today

The basic unit of eternity is [[Now]]. 

This moment. 

Today.

There is never anywhere else We get to live, until we graduate back into [[Eternity]].

Each and every cycle of 24 hours, given to Us one moment at a time, determines Our [[Destiny]]. 

Great temples are not built all at once. They are built up brick by brick. 

Each and every day is like a building block in the Temple We are Co-Creating. 

[[Temple]]. [[Tempo]]. [[Time]]. Tick tok, the clock of [[Kairos]] marches on towards [[Destiny]]. 

If We want to transform Our lives and our world, We must start by transforming [[Today]]. 

If We want to transform today, We must transform Our [[Way]]. 

If We want to transform today, We must transform Our [[Practice]].
