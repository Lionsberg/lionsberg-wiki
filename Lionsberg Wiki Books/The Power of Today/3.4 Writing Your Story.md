# 3.4 Writing Your Story
Over time, we will create additional infrastructure to help You articulate and manage Your Story. 

For now, the important thing to do is to draw it up out of Your Soul and write it down. 

Make the implicit explicit, and make the unconscious conscious. 

To begin, in whatever structured place you like to write and organize notes, spend time responding to the following prompts:

- Where on Earth, and into what circumstances did You find Your Self thrown? 
- What are Your earliest memories of the circumstances into which Your Consciousness awakened?

There is more within You than You could possibly imagine. Longing to emerge.
