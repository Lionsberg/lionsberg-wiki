# 1.11 The Practice of Now
The ultimate expression of a the truly masterful [[Way of Being]] is one in which the Spirit flows through Us at all levels into every moment. 

It is one in which We are consummately present, as a conduit of the Spirit, emptied out of all that would inhibit Its Flow. 

A true master no longer is limited to the forms. 

A true master simply flows. 

A true master simply is. 

Yet only one in billions attains such a state. 

For the rest of Us, We need to [[Practice]]. 

The [[Way]] We [[Practice]] is through the [[Way]] we are [[Today]].
