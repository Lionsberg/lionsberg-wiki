# 1.11 The Practice of Now

The ultimate expression of a the truly masterful [[Way of Being]] is one in which the Spirit flows through Us into every moment of every [[Time]] and [[Space]] we find our [[Selves]] [[Thrown]] into. 

It is one in which We are consummately present, as a conduit of the Spirit, emptied out of all that would inhibit Its powerful and transformational [[Flow]].  

A true master no longer is limited to the forms.  

A true master simply [[Flow|flows]].  

A true master simply Is.  

Yet only one in billions attains such a state.  

For the rest of Us, We need to [[Practice]]. Just as the Masters still [[Practice]].  

The [[Way]] We [[Practice]] is through the [[Way]] we are [[Today]]. Through the [[Way]] we Are [[Now]].  

As a [[Starting Point]], We can use [[Today]] as a proxy for the [[Now]].  

As we grow more advanced, we can narrow the gap to an hour as proxy for now, 15 minutes as a proxy for now, 1 minute as a proxy for now, coming ever closer to, yet never fulling grasping or attaining, Absolute Presence in the Now.
