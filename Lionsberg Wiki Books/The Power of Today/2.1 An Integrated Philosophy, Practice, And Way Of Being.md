# 2.1 An Integrated Philosophy, Practice, And Way Of Being

We are not going to assume the background or training of anyone. 

Therefore We are going to begin at the beginning, and attempt to lay out, for those who have not already mastered or transcended one, an [[Integrated]] [[Philosophy]],[[Theory]], [[Practice]], [[Process]], and [[Way of Being]] purpose-built help You discover and [[Realize]] Your unique [[Potential]] in pursuit of the [[Most Worthy Goal]]. 

This [[Integrated Delivery System]] is purpose-built to be pointed at the [[Most Worthy Goal]] of which you can conceive, and the best person You could possibly become, and to bring those things into [[Reality]] through One Another. 

It is [[Process]] of [[Reciprocal Opening]] through which You transform and are transformed by the [[Reality]] You [[Co-Create]].  

This [[Way]] begins with [[One]] overarching and uniting [[Meta Idea]] that integrates [[All]] within Itself.  

It progresses into a complete [[Philosophy]] of Life...  

That informs a [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Values]]...  

That is then expressed in [[Theory]]...  

That is then integrated in [[Science]]...   

That is then systematically tested through a [[Practice]] and [[Way of Being]] that causes all elements of the [[Integrated]] System to rise towards every greater harmony with [[One]] and [[One Another]].   

This total [[Process]] elevates and transforms Our [[Selves]] and Our world towards Our [[Destiny]].
