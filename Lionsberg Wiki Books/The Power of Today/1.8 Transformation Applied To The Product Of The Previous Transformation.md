# 1.8 Transformation Applied To The Product Of The Previous Transformation

Every day is a [[Transformation Applied To The Product Of The Previous Transformation]]. 

You wake up in a certain [[State of Being]].  

It is not possible to remain the same, so You transform and become either a little [[Better]] or a little [[Worse]].  

A little more [[Alive]] or a little more [[Dead]].  

A little more [[Success]] or a little more [[Failure]].  

Then You sleep, consolidate the transformation, and awaken again as something new.  

That new thing is a little [[Better]] or a little [[Worse]] than what You were the day before.  

That new thing cannot remain the same, so it transforms again. 

And then again.  

Over and over again.  

[[Spiraling Up]] towards something like [[Life]], [[Success]], and [[Heaven]]…  

…or [[Spiraling Down]] towards something like [[Death]], [[Failure]], and [[Hell]].  

It is stark, but true. Not shallowly or religiously True. But deeply, Truly, True. 

[[Today]], and everyday, You are Progressively Realizing Your [[Destiny]].  

The specific [[Way]] that You are Realizing Your Destiny is by *[[Becoming]] It*. Today.
