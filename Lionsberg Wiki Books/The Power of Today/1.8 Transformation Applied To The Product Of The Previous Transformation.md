# 1.8 Transformation Applied To The Product Of The Previous Transformation
Every day is a [[Transformation Applied To The Product Of The Previoius Transformation]]. 

Let Us explain. 

You wake up in a certain [[State of Being]]. 

It is not possible to remain the same, so You transform and become either a little [[Better]] or a little [[Worse]]. 

A little more [[Alive]] or a little more [[Dead]]. 

A little more [[Success]] or a little more [[Failure]]. 

Then You sleep, consolidate the transformation, and awaken again as something new. 

That new thing is a little [[Better]] or a little [[Worse]] than what You were before. 

That new thing cannot remain the same, so it transforms again. And again. 

Over and over again. 

Spiraling up towards something like [[Life]], [[Success]], and [[Heaven]]…

…or spiraling down towards something like [[Death]], [[Failure]], and [[Hell]]. 

It is stark, but true. 

[[Today]], everyday, You are [[Realize|Realizing]] Your [[Destiny]].

The very specific [[Way]] that You are Realizing Your Destiny is by [[Becoming]] It.
