# 2.6 The Gift Of Philosophy
Next We offer You the gift of Philosophy. 

You may already have a fully Integrated, Wise, and Truthful [[Philosophy]] of Life. 

If You share in our deep and passionate [[Love]] of [[Wisdom]], please feel free to join Us in Our ongoing [[Quest]] to [[Navigate]] towards [[Wisdom]] and [[Truth]], and search them out.  

Our approach to [[Philosophy]] extends out in an [[Integrated]] [[Way]] into the Structure, Theory, Process, and Practice of the entire [[Lionsberg System]]. 

The entire system is built around the Idea that the Wisdom, Principles, and Values We are [[Discern|Discerning]] must be [[Operationalize|Operationalized]] into an [[Embody|Embodied]] Reality.
