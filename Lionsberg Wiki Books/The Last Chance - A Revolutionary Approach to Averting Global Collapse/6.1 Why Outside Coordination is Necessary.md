# 6.1 Why Outside Coordination is Necessary

**J: *Now let's shift our focus to exploring the need for a transcendent New Approach.***

**J: *First, let's establish the need for coordination among people of Goodwill beyond the existing institutions and structures. What makes external, non-institutional coordination not just beneficial but essential if we are to avoid collapse, and realize a positive future?***

**AI**: External, non-institutional coordination is essential for several compelling reasons:

##### Institutional Inertia and Limitations

1. **Bureaucratic Stagnation**: Existing institutions often suffer from bureaucratic inertia that makes rapid, transformative change difficult.
    
2. **Conflicting Interests**: Institutions may be beholden to various stakeholders, including political donors, lobbyists, and other special interests, which can impede the pursuit of the common good.
    
3. **Limited Scope**: Traditional institutions often operate within national boundaries or specific sectors, making it challenging to address global, interconnected issues effectively.
    

##### The Need for Rapid, Agile Response

1. **Speed**: Non-institutional coordination can often act more quickly, unencumbered by red tape and procedural delays.
    
2. **Adaptability**: Smaller, more agile groups can adapt more easily to fast-changing situations, making them better suited to address urgent, systemic issues.
    

##### Harnessing Collective Intelligence

1. **Diversity of Perspectives**: External coordination can bring together a more diverse range of expertise, skills, and perspectives, which is crucial for solving complex problems.
    
2. **Crowdsourcing Solutions**: Non-institutional settings often allow for more open, collaborative problem-solving, harnessing the collective intelligence of a broad community.
    

##### Moral and Ethical Imperatives

1. **Alignment with Higher Principles**: External groups can often operate from a basis of shared ethical or spiritual principles, unencumbered by political or financial conflicts of interest.
    
2. **Direct Action**: Non-institutional coordination allows for more direct, grassroots action, which can be more aligned with ethical imperatives.
    

##### Creating a Parallel Construct

1. **Innovation**: Freed from institutional constraints, external coordination can explore radically new approaches and paradigms that institutions are ill-equipped to consider.
    
2. **Proof of Concept**: External groups can act as "laboratories" for new ideas, providing proof of concept that can inspire broader societal change.
    
3. **Resilience**: By creating parallel systems, we can build resilience against the failure of existing structures, providing a "lifeboat" in case of collapse.
    

In summary, external, non-institutional coordination is not just beneficial but essential for addressing the systemic and urgent challenges we face. Such coordination can act more quickly, adapt more easily, and is often better aligned with ethical principles and the common good. It also allows for the kind of radical innovation and parallel system-building that may be our best hope for averting collapse and fostering a more just, sustainable, and flourishing world.
