# 7.6 The Lionsberg System of Ecology

**J: *Can you explain how the Lionsberg System is designed to reintegrate humanity into harmony not only with God and One Another, but also with the Natural Systems that contain and sustain us across the generations? Explain in particular the interface and measurements established between the Human System and Living System to ensure all systems stay in balance.***

##### The Lionsberg System of Ecology: Harmonizing Human and Natural Systems

The Lionsberg System aims to create a harmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world, recognizing that ecological sustainability is not just an environmental issue but a comprehensive ethical, spiritual, and societal challenge. Here's how the system addresses this:

##### Ecological Principles

1. **Stewardship and Sacredness**: The Lionsberg System views the Earth and its ecosystems as sacred trusts that humanity is responsible for stewarding. This stewardship is not just about conservation but also about active regeneration of damaged ecosystems.
    
2. **Circular Economy**: Moving away from the linear "take, make, dispose" model, the Lionsberg System adopts a circular economy that mimics natural cycles, aiming for zero waste and the continual use of resources.
    
3. **Regenerative Agriculture**: The system promotes agricultural practices that regenerate the soil and ecosystems rather than depleting them, emphasizing permaculture, agroforestry, and holistic land management.
    
4. **Sustainable Energy**: The Lionsberg System advocates for a rapid transition to renewable energy sources, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.
    

##### Interface and Measurements

1. **Ecological Footprint Accounting**: The system employs comprehensive ecological footprint accounting to measure the impact of human activities on the Earth's ecosystems. This includes not just carbon footprints but also water, land, and resource footprints.
    
2. **Planetary Boundaries**: The Lionsberg System uses the concept of planetary boundaries to define the 'safe operating space' for humanity. These boundaries are continually monitored and serve as critical indicators for policy adjustments.
    
3. **Bio-Regional Assessments**: The system conducts regular bio-regional assessments to understand the health of local ecosystems and to tailor local policies accordingly.
    
4. **Human-Nature Feedback Loops**: Advanced monitoring and data analytics are used to establish real-time feedback loops between human activities and ecological impacts. This allows for adaptive management strategies that can be adjusted in real-time.
    
5. **Community-Based Monitoring**: Local communities are empowered to monitor their local ecosystems, using both traditional ecological knowledge and modern scientific methods.
    
6. **Spiritual and Ethical Metrics**: Beyond just physical and biological metrics, the Lionsberg System also incorporates spiritual and ethical metrics to assess our relationship with the natural world, such as levels of gratitude, respect, and sacredness attributed to nature.
    

By integrating these ecological principles and measurement systems, the Lionsberg System aims to create a harmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world. It seeks to ensure that human activities are conducted within the ecological limits of the Earth, thereby fostering a sustainable, just, and fulfilling human presence on this planet.
