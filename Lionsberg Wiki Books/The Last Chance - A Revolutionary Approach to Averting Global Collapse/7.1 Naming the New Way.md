# 7.1 Naming the New Way

**J: *Now that we have established the need for a new system and approach in general, let's explore the Lionsberg System as a specific solution humanity can evaluate and implement if it is the Wise Right thing to do*.** 

**J: *How would you explain the difficult issue of why it is necessary to name and actualize a specific new system and approach for humanity, rather than merely advocating for the principles and values? Why is it necessary to translate philosophy, theory, principles, and values into a system and practice that we can learn and apply? Why is it necessary to actually structure and systematize the new system and approach?***

##### Naming the New Way: The Importance of Structuring and Systematizing

1. **Clarity and Focus**: Naming a system provides a focal point around which discussions, debates, and implementations can occur. It crystallizes abstract principles into a concrete form that can be examined, critiqued, and improved.
    
2. **Coordination and Alignment**: A named system serves as a rallying point that can align diverse groups and individuals. It provides a common language and framework that facilitates coordination among stakeholders who might otherwise struggle to collaborate effectively.
    
3. **Operationalization**: Principles and values are essential, but they are often too abstract to guide day-to-day decision-making and action. A structured system translates these high-level concepts into actionable guidelines, protocols, and procedures.
    
4. **Accountability**: A named and structured system allows for clear metrics and benchmarks. This enables ongoing assessment and accountability, making it easier to identify what is working and what needs adjustment.
    
5. **Scalability**: A well-defined system can be more easily replicated and scaled. This is crucial for tackling global challenges that require coordinated action across different scales and contexts.
    
6. **Adaptability**: While the core principles and values may remain constant, a structured system allows for adaptability in implementation. This is crucial in a rapidly changing world where one-size-fits-all solutions are often inadequate.
    
7. **Cultural Resonance**: Naming a system gives it a cultural identity, making it more memorable and easier to advocate for. This can be vital for gaining public support and momentum.
    
8. **Resource Allocation**: A structured system provides a framework for prioritizing and allocating resources, both human and material. This is essential for effective action.
    
9. **Legal and Policy Framework**: A named and structured system can more easily interface with existing legal and policy frameworks, or serve as the basis for creating new ones that are more aligned with its principles.
    
10. **Legacy and Continuity**: A well-defined system has a better chance of outliving its founders and initial advocates. This is crucial for creating lasting change.
    

In summary, while principles and values provide the philosophical underpinning, a named and structured system serves as the vehicle that translates these into real-world impact. It serves as the bridge between theory and practice, between what ought to be and what is. Without this bridge, even the most enlightened principles risk remaining lofty ideals rather than lived realities.
