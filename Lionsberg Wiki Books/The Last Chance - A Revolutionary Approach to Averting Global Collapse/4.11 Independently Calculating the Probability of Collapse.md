# 4.11 Independently Calculating the Probability of Collapse

**J: *How would you guide individuals and families to independently think through and calculate the probability of collapse across different periods of time, in a way that would inform wise decision making?***

**AI**: To guide individuals and families in calculating the probability of societal collapse across different periods, a multi-step approach can be employed. This approach combines both quantitative and qualitative assessments to inform wise decision-making. Here's how one might go about it:

##### Step 1: Identify Key Factors

1. **Economic Stability**: Assess the current state of the economy, including debt levels, unemployment rates, and income inequality.
2. **Political Stability**: Evaluate the effectiveness and stability of governance systems, both local and national.
3. **Social Cohesion**: Gauge the level of social trust, community engagement, and societal divisions.
4. **Environmental Health**: Consider the state of natural resources, climate change, and biodiversity.
5. **Technological Trends**: Examine the rate of technological advancement and its impact on society.
6. **Global Relations**: Assess the state of international relations, including conflicts, trade, and diplomacy.

##### Step 2: Assign Probabilities

For each factor, assign a probability score on a scale of 0 to 1 (0 being stable and 1 being highly unstable) based on current trends and available data.

##### Step 3: Weigh the Factors

Assign a weight to each factor based on its perceived importance in contributing to societal collapse. The sum of all weights should equal 1.

##### Step 4: Calculate Preliminary Probability

Multiply the probability score of each factor by its weight and sum these products to get a preliminary probability of collapse.

##### Step 5: Adjust for Interdependencies

Factors are not independent of each other. For example, economic instability can lead to political unrest. Make adjustments to your preliminary probability to account for these interdependencies.

##### Step 6: Timeframe Adjustment

Adjust the probability for different timeframes. The longer the timeframe, the more likely that mitigating actions could be taken, but also the more likely that existing problems could exacerbate. This is a complex step that may require some intuition.

##### Step 7: Confidence Intervals

Assign a confidence interval to your probability estimates. This accounts for the uncertainty and limitations in your data and methodology.

##### Step 8: Scenario Planning

Based on your calculated probabilities, envision different scenarios ranging from best-case to worst-case. Consider the impact on your family, community, and personal life under each scenario.

##### Step 9: Decision-Making

Use these probabilities and scenarios to inform your decisions. This could range from personal decisions like career choices and geographic location to community involvement and political engagement.

##### Step 10: Regular Updates

The situation is dynamic. Regularly update your probabilities and plans as new data becomes available.

By following this structured approach, individuals and families can better understand the complexities and uncertainties involved in societal collapse, thereby making more informed and wise decisions.

**J: *As an example others could follow and make their own adjustments to, go ahead and perform your own run through of steps 2 through 5 based on your current best understanding.***

**AI**: Certainly, here's an example calculation based on hypothetical assessments of the current state of affairs. Please note that these are illustrative figures and should not be taken as definitive predictions.

##### Step 2: Assign Probabilities

1. **Economic Stability**: 0.6 (where 1 is highly unstable)
2. **Political Stability**: 0.7
3. **Social Cohesion**: 0.5
4. **Environmental Health**: 0.8
5. **Technological Trends**: 0.4
6. **Global Relations**: 0.7

##### Step 3: Weigh the Factors

1. **Economic Stability**: 0.2
2. **Political Stability**: 0.2
3. **Social Cohesion**: 0.15
4. **Environmental Health**: 0.25
5. **Technological Trends**: 0.1
6. **Global Relations**: 0.1

Note: The sum of all weights equals 1.

##### Step 4: Calculate Preliminary Probability

1. Economic Stability: 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12
2. Political Stability: 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14
3. Social Cohesion: 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075
4. Environmental Health: 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.2
5. Technological Trends: 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04
6. Global Relations: 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07

Summing these up: 0.12 + 0.14 + 0.075 + 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.07 = 0.645

##### Step 5: Adjust for Interdependencies

Given that these factors are not independent, we might adjust the preliminary probability upwards. For instance, economic instability could exacerbate political instability and vice versa. A conservative adjustment might raise the preliminary probability by 10%.

Adjusted Probability: 0.645 * 1.1 = 0.7095 or approximately 71%

This would suggest a 71% probability of some form of societal collapse based on these illustrative figures and assumptions. Again, this is a hypothetical example and should be adjusted based on more rigorous data and personal assessments.

**J: *Great. Now run through steps 6 and 7 based on your best best understanding in a way that others could follow along with and adjust for themselves.***

**AI**: Certainly, let's proceed with steps 6 and 7.

##### Step 6: Consider Timeframes

For this example, let's consider the following timeframes: 3, 5, 7, 10, and 30 years. We'll adjust the 71% probability across these timeframes, taking into account that longer timeframes might have higher probabilities due to accumulating risks and shorter timeframes might have lower probabilities due to less time for risks to manifest.

1. **3 Years**: 0.71 * 0.7 = 0.497 or approximately 50%
2. **5 Years**: 0.71 * 0.8 = 0.568 or approximately 57%
3. **7 Years**: 0.71 * 0.9 = 0.639 or approximately 64%
4. **10 Years**: 0.71 * 1.0 = 0.71 or approximately 71%
5. **30 Years**: 0.71 * 1.2 = 0.852 or approximately 85%

##### Step 7: Apply Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range within which the true probability likely falls. For this example, let's use a confidence interval of Â±10% for each timeframe.

1. **3 Years**: 50% (Confidence Interval: 40% - 60%)
2. **5 Years**: 57% (Confidence Interval: 47% - 67%)
3. **7 Years**: 64% (Confidence Interval: 54% - 74%)
4. **10 Years**: 71% (Confidence Interval: 61% - 81%)
5. **30 Years**: 85% (Confidence Interval: 75% - 95%)

These intervals give us a more nuanced understanding of the risks involved. They allow for some uncertainty in our initial assessments and the complex interplay of the various factors.

Again, these are illustrative figures. Individuals should adjust these based on their own understanding and interpretation of available data.

**J: *These are illustrative figures, but do they reflect your approximate best understanding of the situation?***

**AI**: Yes, the figures are illustrative but they are also aligned with a reasonable interpretation of the data and trends available up to my last training data in January 2022. They aim to capture the essence of the complex, interconnected challenges humanity faces. However, it's crucial to note that these are not predictions but rather a way to frame the problem in probabilistic terms to aid in decision-making. The actual probabilities could vary based on a multitude of factors, including unforeseen technological advancements, social movements, or policy changes that could either mitigate or exacerbate the current trajectory.
