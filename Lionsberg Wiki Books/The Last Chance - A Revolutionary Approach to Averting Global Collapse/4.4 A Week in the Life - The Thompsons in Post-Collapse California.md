##### A Week in the Life: The Thompsons in Post-Collapse California

###### Day 1: Monday

**Morning**: Sarah Thompson wakes up to the sound of her solar-powered radio crackling with static. She looks at her husband, Mark, who's already awake, staring at the ceiling. Their two children, Emily (12) and Jack (8), are still asleep on makeshift beds in the corner of their one-room cabin.

**Afternoon**: Mark goes out to check the traps he set in the woods. Protein is scarce these days. Sarah takes the kids to the community well, a mile's walk away. They carry empty jugs, passing by abandoned cars overgrown with weeds.

**Evening**: Dinner is a thin stew made from foraged plants and a rabbit from Mark's traps. They eat in silence, each lost in thought. Afterward, Mark tries to fix their water filtration system with salvaged parts.

###### Day 2: Tuesday

**Morning**: Sarah homeschools Emily and Jack. She's using old textbooks to teach them basic math and history. She wonders how much of the history is still relevant.

**Afternoon**: Sarah joins the neighborhood watch. They've become essential since the police force disbanded. Today, they find a stranger lurking near the community well. After a tense confrontation, they let him go but not before warning him to stay away.

**Evening**: Mark manages to tune into a pirate radio station. The broadcaster talks about a small uprising in San Francisco, quickly suppressed by the local warlord's forces. They listen, hearts pounding.

###### Day 3: Wednesday

**Morning**: Mark and Sarah discuss joining a trading caravan to the next town. They need medicine. Emily has been coughing more frequently, and they're out of antibiotics.

**Afternoon**: Sarah and the kids tend to their small vegetable garden. It's a poor substitute for a grocery store, but it's all they have. They also collect rainwater—every drop counts.

**Evening**: They gather around a small fire, telling stories to distract from their growling stomachs. Mark brings out a harmonica and plays a melancholy tune.

###### Day 4: Thursday

**Morning**: Sarah wakes up to find Emily's condition has worsened. She's feverish and weak. The decision is made—Mark will join the trading caravan.

**Afternoon**: Mark leaves with other men from the community. Sarah watches him go, praying for his safe return. She feels the weight of her family's survival pressing down on her.

**Evening**: Sarah reads Emily and Jack a story by candlelight, a luxury they can seldom afford. Tonight, it feels necessary.

###### Day 5: Friday

**Morning**: Sarah takes Emily to the community's makeshift clinic. The nurse, operating out of her living room, confirms it's a bacterial infection. Without antibiotics, it could be fatal.

**Afternoon**: Sarah spends the day reinforcing their cabin's defenses. She teaches Jack how to set a basic snare trap.

**Evening**: Dinner is canned beans and a small portion of rice. Sarah portions out their dwindling supplies, wondering how much longer they can last.

###### Day 6: Saturday

**Morning**: Sarah wakes up to find Emily struggling to breathe. Panic sets in.

**Afternoon**: A messenger arrives. The trading caravan has returned. Mark is injured but alive. They've brought medicine.

**Evening**: Sarah administers the antibiotics to Emily. The family gathers around Mark, listening to his harrowing tale of the journey. For the first time in a long time, they feel a glimmer of hope.

###### Day 7: Sunday

**Morning**: They wake up to the sound of rain. Sarah collects as much as she can in buckets and pots.

**Afternoon**: The community gathers at the remains of what was once a church. They pray, not for salvation, but for the strength to face another week.

**Evening**: As night falls, Sarah looks at her family, huddled together in their cabin. They're malnourished, anxious, and constantly on edge, but they're alive, and for now, that's enough.

In this post-collapse world, the Thompsons, like many others, live day-to-day, their lives dictated by the need for basic survival. The future is a foggy landscape, but they navigate it the only way they know how—together.
