# 4.6 Trickle Up Collapse

**J: *Those are dire. What if any connection do you see between the ~ two thirds collapse we have seen in many insect and wildlife populations, and the potential for mass-mortality to trickle up into the human species?***

**AI**: The decline in insect and wildlife populations is a significant indicator of ecological imbalance and environmental degradation. This decline has far-reaching implications for ecosystems, including those that humans rely on for survival. Here are some of the ways in which the collapse of insect and wildlife populations could contribute to human vulnerability:

1. **Food Chain Disruption**: Insects and other wildlife often serve as the base or intermediate levels of food chains. Their decline can lead to a collapse of predator populations and disrupt ecosystems, affecting species that humans rely on for food.
    
2. **Pollination**: Many of the world's crops rely on insects for pollination. A decline in pollinator populations could lead to reduced agricultural yields, contributing to food insecurity.
    
3. **Soil Health**: Insects contribute to soil fertility. Their decline could lead to less fertile soils, affecting agriculture and increasing the risk of food scarcity.
    
4. **Water Quality**: Healthy ecosystems, including those inhabited by various wildlife, contribute to water purification. Their decline could lead to water quality issues, affecting both human health and agriculture.
    
5. **Disease Control**: Some insects and wildlife play roles in controlling populations of other organisms that are disease vectors. Their decline could lead to increased prevalence of diseases.
    
6. **Psychological and Cultural Impact**: The loss of biodiversity can have psychological effects on humans, contributing to what some have termed "ecological grief," and can also impact cultures that have deep ties to specific forms of wildlife.
    
7. **Resource Conflicts**: As ecosystems degrade and resources become scarce, the likelihood of conflict over remaining resources could increase, leading to social instability.
    
8. **Economic Impact**: The decline in biodiversity can have economic consequences, affecting industries like agriculture, fishing, and tourism, which in turn can exacerbate social issues.
    
9. **Feedback Loops**: The decline in wildlife and insect populations can create feedback loops that accelerate environmental degradation, making conditions increasingly inhospitable for human life.
    
10. **Global Interconnectedness**: In our globalized world, ecological problems in one area can have ripple effects that impact distant regions, making the problem a global one.
    

The decline in insect and wildlife populations serves as a canary in the coal mine, signaling broader ecological imbalances that could very well "trickle up" to impact human populations. The interconnectedness of ecological and human systems means that we cannot consider them in isolation from one another. The mass mortality in lower trophic levels of the food web could be a precursor to similar, cascading effects in higher trophic levels, including humans.
