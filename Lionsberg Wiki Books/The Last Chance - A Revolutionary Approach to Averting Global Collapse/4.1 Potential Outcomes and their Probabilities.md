# 4.1 Potential Outcomes and their Probabilities

**J: *Those probabilities will probably be shocking high to many people. They approximately match my intuition as well. Now that we have a hypothesis around **probability**, let's advance to exploring **severity**.***

**J: *Assuming that the existing world order collapses within a generation, what are the 5 most likely outcomes, and what is the percentage probability of each occurring?***

**AI**: If the existing world order collapses within a generation, the outcomes could vary widely depending on a multitude of factors, including the nature of the collapse, the responses of different actors, and unforeseen events. However, based on current trends and historical precedents, here are five of the most likely outcomes, along with speculative percentage probabilities:

1. **Global Authoritarianism (20-25%)**: In the absence of the current world order, authoritarian regimes could seize the opportunity to expand their influence, leading to a more authoritarian global governance structure. This could involve a coalition of authoritarian states or a single dominant power imposing its will.
    
2. **Regional Fragmentation (30-35%)**: Countries could turn inward and focus on regional alliances for security and economic stability. This could result in a multipolar world with several regional powers but no global hegemony.
    
3. **Sustained Anarchy and Conflict (15-20%)**: A collapse could lead to a prolonged period of global instability, characterized by frequent conflicts, failed states, and humanitarian crises. In this scenario, no single governance model would replace the existing world order in the short term.
    
4. **Emergence of a New Democratic Order (10-15%)**: A more optimistic outcome would be the rise of a new, more equitable and sustainable democratic world order. This would require unprecedented global cooperation and could be facilitated by grassroots movements, reformed international institutions, and enlightened leadership.
    
5. **Technological Dystopia (5-10%)**: Advances in technology could lead to a world where surveillance, data manipulation, and artificial intelligence are used to control populations, either by state actors or by private corporations that gain excessive influence.
    
These probabilities are highly speculative and should be taken as such. They are based on a reading of current geopolitical, economic, and social trends, and they could change dramatically due to unforeseen events or shifts in these trends.
