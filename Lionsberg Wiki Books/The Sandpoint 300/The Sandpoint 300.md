# Invitation to Join The Sandpoint 300
***A Call to Community and Action***

Dear Neighbor, 

As we celebrate the holidays and look ahead to a New Year, we are facing into one of the most uncertain times in modern history. The world is changing rapidly, and as national and global systems grow increasingly fragile, the strength, resilience, and unity of local communities like ours will determine how we not only survive but _thrive_ through the storms ahead.

Fifteen years ago, Sandpoint demonstrated its heart and capacity for transformation by [becoming the second "Transition Town" in the United States](https://sandpointonline.com/sandpointmag/sms09/transition_initiative.html). Projects like the community garden and the folk school remain a testament to what we can achieve together. Yet, countless dreams and potentials still long to be realized, and critical risks require ongoing action.

Now, we stand at a pivotal moment. The time to strengthen our local capacity and resilience is now, _before systems and supply chains collapse._

We invite you to join **The Sandpoint 300**—an initiative to unite and empower a diverse and capable group of individuals in our community to create a model of wisdom, unity, resilience, strength and cooperation.

Our mission is to connect and empower **the first three percent** of Sandpoint residents—roughly 300 citizens in our town of 10,000—in service of ensuring that _all_ members of the community can thrive, no matter what comes our way.

## **What Is The Sandpoint 300?**

The Sandpoint 300 is a community effort to build a foundation of **strength, skills, shared resources, and infrastructure** that will:

- **Secure Local Resilience:** Develop systems for food, water, energy, and communication that can function independently if needed.
- **Foster Connection:** Build trust and cooperation among neighbors, creating a network of mutual support. 
- **Prepare for the Future:** Train in practical skills and prepare for potential disruptions with a spirit of unity, coordination, and collaboration.

## **Why You?**

We believe every person has unique strengths, knowledge, and resources to contribute. Whether you’re a skilled tradesperson, teacher, healer, farmer, engineer, entrepreneur, or simply someone who cares deeply about our community, **you have an essential role to play.**

### **Our Next Steps**

We are starting small but dreaming big. With your engagement, over the next 90 days we will:

- Build an initial core team to organize and lead this effort.  
- Launch pilot projects, such as strengthening local food systems and conducting skills workshops.
- Map Sandpoint’s resources and outline a local emergency preparedness plan.
- Begin networking and recruiting the first 100 members of **The Sandpoint 300** to join this journey.
