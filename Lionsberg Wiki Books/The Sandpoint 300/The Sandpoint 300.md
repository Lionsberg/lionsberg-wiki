# Invitation to Join The Sandpoint 300
***A Call to Community Resilience, Unity, and Action***

Dear Neighbor, 

As the New Year begins, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in history. The world is shifting beneath our feet, and Sandpoint, like so many communities, stands at a moment of profound importance. National and global systems are faltering, and the challenges ahead will test the strength, resilience, and unity of every town, every family, and every soul. Facing one of the most uncertain times in history, communities like ours are challenged to self-organize and step forward together to ensure that Sandpoint not only endures but thrives—no matter what lies ahead. 

Sandpoint has always been a special place—a beacon of creativity, talent, and heart. Fifteen years ago, we proved what this community is capable of when we became the second-ever [“Transition Town” in the United States](https://sandpointonline.com/sandpointmag/sms09/transition_initiative.html). The projects born from that vision—like the community garden and folk school—remain as testaments to what we can achieve when we come together.

Today, the stakes are higher, and the need is greater than ever. As national and global disruptions ripple closer to home, the time to act is now—**before systems and supply chains fail.** This is our moment to step forward—boldly, together—and ensure that Sandpoint not only weathers the storms ahead but thrives as a model of hope, resilience, and unity.

## **What Is The Sandpoint 300?**

**The Sandpoint 300** is a locally focused initiative to unite and empower an initial group of **three hundred individuals**—**the first three percent**—to lay the foundations for a resilient, thriving Sandpoint that can meet any challenge. Inspired and guided by the shared wisdom of [[The Lionsberg Alliance]]—a collaborative effort dedicated to uniting leaders and strengthening communities and worldwide—this movement is designed to ensure that Sandpoint becomes a model of hope, resilience, and connection.

This initiative focuses on three pillars:

- **Local Resilience:** Strengthen systems for food, water, energy, and communication that can function independently if needed.
- **Connection and Collaboration:** Build trust and cooperation among neighbors to create a powerful network of mutual support.
- **Preparation and Action:** Train in essential skills and develop plans to address potential disruptions, all grounded in a spirit of unity and care.

This is more than a response to crisis—it is an opportunity to co-create something extraordinary. By stepping forward together, we can make Sandpoint a model of hope, resilience, and inspiration for other communities around the world.

## **Why You?**

Because **you matter**.

Every person in Sandpoint has unique strengths, knowledge, resources, and relationships to contribute. Whether you are a farmer, teacher, healer, parent, artist, builder, entrepreneur, or simply someone who cares deeply about Sandpoint, **your gifts are essential.**

You are here for a reason, and together, we can transform the challenges ahead into opportunities to create a legacy of resilience, inspiration, and hope.

### **Our Next Steps**

- Form an initial core team to guide this effort.
