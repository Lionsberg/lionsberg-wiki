# Note 1 - On Various Beings and Dimensions

To understand the deeper forces shaping humanity’s past, present, and future, we must start with the highest level of reality—the [[ONE]] **Ultimate Reality**, **Creator** or **Source** from which [[All]] things emanate.

We must seek to understand the nature of this Source, the multidimensional structure of existence, and the vast diversity of landscapes and beings that inhabit it.  

From realms of pure consciousness down to the physical and interdimensional planes, we find ourselves in an intricate, interconnected cosmic ecosystem of trillions of star systems and planets populated by a vast diversity of entities, each with unique roles, purposes, and degrees of alignment with universal principles. Life and intelligence throughout the cosmos in no less diverse than life on Earth.

As we peel back the layers of this cosmic landscape, it becomes clear that humanity is not an isolated phenomenon. Our history, spirituality, and even the fabric of our societies have been influenced by beings beyond Earth, some of whom embody wisdom and benevolence, while others seek manipulate, control and abuse. Understanding these realms and the players within them gives us insight into the larger context of human life and illuminates a Way toward regaining our spiritual sovereignty and re-integrating into our rightful place in the cosmos. 

### The Nature of Ultimate Reality: Source Beyond Duality

At the foundation of [[All]] that exists is [[ONE]] **Ultimate Reality**, sometimes called **Source**, **God**, or **the One**. This Source is not a deity in the anthropomorphic sense, nor is it limited by form, time, or space. It is the unmanifest and undifferentiated essence of existence that is transcendent of [[All]] Its potentials, forms and creations, an infinite field of pure consciousness, Spirit and potential, from which all dimensions, beings, and realities emerge.

Source is not something we can fully comprehend with the mind or describe in words, but rather something we can directly experience and relate to through our journey spiritual awakening and progressive enlightenment.

 Those who reach deeper states of consciousness or enlightenment describe it as a state of unity, a profound sense of omniharmonic oneness that transcends all distinctions, where the apparently individuated self dissolves into an all-encompassing awareness and love.

From this [[ONE]] Absolute and Ultimate Creative Source emanates the fundamental principles that govern existence, including **truth**, **love**, **justice**, **stewardship**, **wisdom**, **balance**, and **free will**. These principles points towards the total nested hierarchy of values that together as a Whole form the bedrock of co-creation, guiding the unfolding of universes, realms, and the countless beings who inhabit them. 
Though Source itself is beyond word, form, and expression, It expresses itself through a layered, multidimensional structure of co-creation and interexistence that allows Its All-Permeaning Spirit and Consciousness to experience and know ItSelf in an infinite variety of ways.

### The Spectrum of Realms: From Pure Consciousness to Physical Reality

Moving outward as a co-creative expression of Ultimate Reality, Reality unfolds in a vast spectrum of realms and dimensions, each with its own unique characteristics, frequencies, and laws of existence. These realms range from states of pure consciousness before form, to differentiated metaphysical entities, all the way down to the densest physical realities. They are populated by a panoply of beings who exist in varying degrees of harmonic alignment with, or in discordant contrast to, the principles, values, and intention of Source. Each dimension and realm serves a specific purpose, offering different environments for consciousness to evolve, express, and explore.

Archangels, ascended masters, emanations, and the highest spiritual beings do not require physical forms and instead exist as pure associations of energy and consciousness, operating within the highest vibrational frequencies of love and enlightenment. They are not bound by individual identity in the way humans are but embody collective archetypes that serve as templates of divine principles. 

Angels, demons, devas, and celestial messengers of varying types lie a step down. 

These beings serve as intermediaries between the higher and lower realms, often acting as protectors, messengers, guides, deceivers, tempters, or destroyers.  

They are often associated with specific qualities or “offices,” such as justice, healing, and protection, and each angel or celestial being has a particular role in supporting the cosmic order. Certain entities also are responsible for various spatiotemporal realms or domains. 

While not bound by physical form, they can appear to humanity in ways that are perceptible to the mind or senses, creating experiences that shape spiritual beliefs and practices.

The **interdimensional** and **elemental realms** are inhabited by beings that exist in non-physical but denser frequencies. These beings include entities humans point to with words such as **elementals**, **nature spirits**, **jinn**, and various interdimensional entities who often serve as custodians of specific environments, energies, or roles within creation. They exist beyond and between dimensions and can influence thoughts, emotions, and events, especially when invited or inadvertently summoned by specific energies.  

The malevolent beings inhabiting these realms include extremely ancient and powerful forces that would otherwise be considered archangels or ascended masters, had they not exercised their Free Will to betray the [[ONE]] / Source.  

Within the layers of physical and non-physical realms, we encounter **extraterrestrial civilizations** that have evolved in other star systems and galaxies, many with highly advanced technology and consciousness abilities. These beings, from civilizations such as the **Pleiadians**, **Arcturians**, **Sirians**, **Reptilians**, and **Greys**, interact with humanity in varied ways, each with its own motives, purposes, and ethical alignments.  

According to Pleiadian sources, there have been nearly 300 different species of extraterrestrials that have visited and interacted with Earth throughout its history. 

Some extraterrestrial groups, like the **Pleiadians** and **Arcturians**, are highly advanced in consciousness and operate with a benevolent approach, seeking to support humanity’s evolution without imposing their will. Others, like certain factions of the **Reptilians** and **Greys**, have interests more aligned with control, resource extraction, genetic engineering, technological expansion, and the control. In some cases up to and including the genetic control, domestication, harvesting, and predation upon species they view as inferior. 

These beings have influenced human societies by working through select groups or individuals, offering technological knowledge or leveraging power structures to achieve their aims.

Their interactions with humanity range from open contact, to covert influence through hidden alliances with human elites, to collaborating side by side with human beings as regular employees in government, military, aerospace, defense, and international affairs. 

Understanding these civilizations, their history, and their motives is essential to navigating the future, as their agendas often impact Earth’s technological, social, and political trajectories.

Some of these species are also capable of acting and moving between dimensions and beyond spacetime as perceived by humans on Earth. 

Many species can also shape shift and transform their appearance, making them very difficult to detect. 

### Humanity’s Place Within the Cosmic Landscape

Humanity exists within a dynamic intersection of these realms, influenced by beings across a wide spectrum of consciousness and existence, yet directly and personally permeated by and connected to Source. While we may feel isolated within the physical plane, we are intrinsically connected to this larger cosmic ecosystem, and our actions, thoughts, and intentions affect and are affected by this vast web of life, energy and consciousness.

The journey of human evolution, co-creation and enlightenment is deeply intertwined with the forces that interact with Earth, whether they are helping, guiding, manipulating, controlling or simply observing.

Humanity has often perceived beings from other realms and dimensions as gods, demons, angels, and spirits, interpreting their appearances and interactions through the lens of cultural beliefs and limited understanding. Many of our religious myths, archetypes, and spiritual teachings have roots in encounters with these beings, which were often misunderstood, exalted, or demonized out of ignorance and fear. 

As we begin to awaken to the reality of this multidimensional existence, we gain the ability to discern between beings that support our freedom and growth and those that seek to manipulate or control. This understanding is crucial as humanity faces a turning point: we are moving toward a time when interactions with these beings will become more direct, undeniable, and visible on a global scale and beyond. 

Crucially, humanity will need to decide whether it will remain divided, subordinated to, and manipulated by any faction of these beings, or whether it will rise into harmony, coherence and right relationship with the Creator and All Creation, and take up its rightful, interdependent, and equal place in the cosmic order.

### The Illusion of Time, Space, and Separation

One of the key revelations of moving beyond the matrix is that **time, space, and separation** are constructs, tools for experiencing reality within the physical plane but not fundamental truths. In the higher realms, time does not exist as a linear sequence but as a fluid, multidimensional tapestry where all moments are interconnected. Likewise, space is an illusion created by vibrational frequencies that give the appearance of distance and separation from the perceptual standpoint of apparently individuated beings. 


Advanced beings understand these principles and operate beyond the limitations of linear time and three-dimensional space. They can appear instantaneously, perceive multiple timelines, and interact across dimensions. This capacity allows them to influence Earth’s trajectory, both through direct interventions and subtle guidance, weaving through layers of reality to create outcomes aligned with their intentions.

This perspective shifts our understanding of “past”, “future,” "space" and "time", revealing that All is interconnected, that choices made in the present impact multiple timelines, realities, and dimensions. As humanity awakens, we, too, will begin to experience the fluidity of time, space, and matter, the power of consciousness to reshape reality, and the understanding that separation is an illusion.

### Preparing for the Journey of Awakening

The purpose of this book is to guide humanity in navigating the complex, multidimensional reality we are awakening into. By understanding the structure of existence, the various beings within it, and our place within the cosmic order, we gain the power to move beyond manipulation, fear, and dependency. We are reminded of our inherent direct connection to Source, our responsibility as conscious beings, and our role as co-creators in the universal symphony of existence.

This is not merely knowledge to be absorbed but a truth to be lived.
