2.  Fostering critical thinking, discernment, and open-mindedness, empowering individuals, groups, and communities to evaluate information and beliefs, and to integrate wisdom and truth into their understanding of the world and their decision-making processes.
3.  Promoting the importance of intellectual and spiritual humility, admitting [[We Do Not Know]], and acknowledging the limits of our understanding and the ongoing nature of the quest for wisdom and truth, while encouraging a willingness to learn from others and to revise our beliefs and perspectives as new insights emerge.
4.  Supporting the cultivation of deep listening, respectful dialogue, and empathetic communication, fostering environments in which wisdom and truth can be shared, explored, and integrated, and where differences in perspectives can be understood and appreciated.
5.  Encouraging the application of wisdom and truth in daily life and work, guiding individuals, groups, and communities to make decisions and take actions that contribute to the well-being of all, in alignment with the Central Animating Spirit. 
6.  Promoting the practice of Dialogue and Discernment in community, recognizing the Divine Spark within each individual, and allowing wisdom and truth to emerge through the unique perspectives of a diverse array of individuals. 
7.  Nurturing a culture of continuous learning, reflection, and growth, recognizing that the pursuit of wisdom and truth is an ongoing process that unfolds through the dynamic interplay of individual and collective experiences, insights, and understandings.
