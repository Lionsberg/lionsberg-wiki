# 2.5 Consciousness and Progressive Enlightenment

The Lionsberg Elevation Initiative recognizes that consciousness and progressive enlightenment play a pivotal role in the co-creation of a harmonious and thriving world. By fostering the continual expansion of individual, local, and collective consciousness and the shared pursuit of enlightenment, the Initiative aims to support individuals, groups, and communities in transcending self-limiting beliefs, embracing the interconnectedness of our shared existence, and embodying the Central Animating Spirit of [[ONE]] Love in their thoughts, actions, and interactions.

To facilitate consciousness and progressive enlightenment, the Lionsberg Elevation Initiative promotes the following principles and practices:

1.  Encouraging the cultivation of self-awareness and mindfulness, empowering individuals, groups, and communities to become more conscious of their thoughts, emotions, and actions, and to develop a deeper understanding of the interconnected nature of existence.
2.  Supporting the exploration and integration of diverse wisdom traditions, philosophies, and practices that contribute to the expansion of consciousness and the pursuit of enlightenment.
3.  Promoting introspection, retrospection, reflection, and contemplative practices that foster inner growth, transformation, and the awakening of higher states of consciousness.
4.  Facilitating experiences and opportunities for individuals, groups, and communities to connect with the Central Animating Spirit of the [[Living System]] flowing from [[ONE]] Source, enhancing their sense of interconnectedness, unity, and compassion.
5.  Encouraging the application of expanded consciousness and progressive enlightenment in everyday life and work, guiding individuals, groups, and communities to make more conscious, compassionate, co-creative, regenerative, and harmonious choices that contribute to the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] 
6.  Fostering a culture of continuous growth, learning, and transformation, recognizing that the journey towards progressive enlightenment is an ongoing process that unfolds through the dynamic interplay of individual and collective evolution.

By promoting consciousness and progressive enlightenment, the Lionsberg Elevation Initiative aims to empower individuals, groups, and communities to experience a deeper sense of interconnectedness, unity, and harmony, empowering them to co-create a thriving, regenerative world.
