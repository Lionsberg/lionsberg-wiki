By fostering the capacity for individuals, groups, and communities to connect with their [[Source]], align with their inner wisdom, and express it through their thoughts, words, and actions, the Initiative aims to create an environment that promotes harmony, integrity, and the embodiment of the [[ONE]] Central Animating Spirit Whose nature is [[Love]].
