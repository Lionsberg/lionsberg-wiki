# Day 14 - Rest, Regeneration, and Retrospection

Greetings, fellow Pioneers, and welcome to Day 14 - Rest, Regeneration, and Retrospection.

There is nothing but rest scheduled for today. We are hard at work, making hard fought progress, and rest, regeneration, and retrospection are crucial to our long term success. Feel free to re-explore [[Day 7 - Rest, Regeneration, and Retrospection]] if you would like some more reading and context. 

With Love, In Community,
