# The LIONSBERG Way
*For inclusion in [[The LIONSBERG Sacred Codex|The LIONSBERG Sacred Codex]]*
*This is a chaotic [[Work In Progress]]*  
*You should probably ignore it for now*    

## Introduction: The Way and Its Incarnations

The [[Way]] transcends, encompasses, undergirds, and upholds [[All]]. 

It was our **[[Old]] Way of Being** that spiraled Us down towards the hellish depths. 

It is Our **[[New]] Way of Being** that Eternally spirals Us up towards the Heavenly Heights in every [[Domain]] We [[InFluence]] and [[InHabit]].  

The Highest [[Way]] is unwritten, ineffable, and eternally Beyond Our grasp. Like the [[ONE]] It Flows From, It expands and recedes in its Infinite Perfection and Glory as We approach It. 

And yet **Our Divine Quest** towards this Ultimate Unity, Perfection, Harmony, Coherence, and Flow requires that We [[Incarnate]] local *reflections* in [[SpaceTime]] that enable Us to experience, grapple with, and Ultimately ReTranscend Our Reality. 

[[LIONSBERG]] is One of these reflections, emanating from the [[ONE]] and locally incarnating Here and Now to [[Inbreak And Displace]] the collapsing [[Old]] Systems and Civilizations with something Wise, Right, True, New, and Good. 

When each inhabitant of each domain voluntarily accepts [[The Invitation]] that The Whole has already selected and accepted HerSelf, We will Join Together in [[The Greatest Celebration and Jubilee In History]], take up Our New Citizenship, and continue the Eternal Work of bringing Heaven to every Domain We InterExist within. 

## The LIONSBERG Way

By differentiating out and naming, among [[All]] the potential ways, **One LIONSBERG Way**, We create the profound opportunity to collaborate to continuously improve a **System** purpose-built to bring Heaven into Reality. 

It is an Ultimately Unified, Harmonized and Cohered [[State of Being]] and a [[Way of Being]], sub-composed the Deepest Wisdom Knowledge regarding **[[How]]** to InterExist in a State that approaches Heaven. 

*Note: The LIONSBERG Way is in the process of transcending, encompassing, and replacing [[The Lionsberg Handbook]].*
