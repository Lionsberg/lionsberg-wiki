# Second Wave Cohort

The Movement is unfolding on the basis of cohorts, who advance together [[The Goal]]. The Strategy and Plan anticipates roughly 50 "Waves" of cohorts to depart in The Exodus FROM the Old TO the New, each separated by 3 to 6 weeks. 

The First Wave Cohort is called the Pioneer Cohort. 

The Second Wave Cohort departs as the Pioneer Cohort passes through Day 21 of the transformative [[Quest]].
