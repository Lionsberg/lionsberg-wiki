# System Wide Master Plan

The System Wide Master Plan is an output of the [[Lionsberg Planning System]]. 

It is the result of an ongoing process for determining how the total Lionsberg [[Program Of Action]] can most effectively be delivered to [[Co-Create]] the [[New World]]. 

___
Guideline development and program validation support the utility of convening a [[System Wide Master Plan|System Wide Master Planning]] process for determining exactly how the [[Program]] can most effectively be delivered. The Master Planning effort will continue to inform the [[Meta Project Program Statement]] and will impact how each [[Projects|Project]] within the Program is delivered.Â  

**_A coordinated [[System]] for developing and delivering the basic resources, infrastructure, and services that solve the problems inherent in every individual, organization and community is necessary to achieve the [[Total Nested Hierarchy of Goals]] of this Program; therefore a system-wide approach is needed.
