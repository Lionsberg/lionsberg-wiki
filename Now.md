# Now

### **Definition**

**Now** is the **Eternal Present**—the only true Moment in which **Life**, **Consciousness**, and **Creation** can be directly experienced. It is the **infinitesimal gateway** through which **Spirit** in the form of **Being** enters the field of **Existence**.

While **[[Chronos]]** measures the succession of time, and **[[Kairos]]** identifies sacred, opportune moments within the Divine [[Flow]] of **Time** beyond measure or [[Perception]], **Now** transcends both as the **ever-present fulcrum** of unfolding [[Reality]], the [[Timeless]] point at which **past**, **present**, and **future** eternally converge.

**Now** is **Presence**. It is [[The Still Small Center]] of turning worlds, [[The Silent Source]] of **Action**, **Awareness**, and **Becoming**.

There is no other [[Time]] to act, to love, to be, to heal, to transform, to co-create, to become, than **Now**.

### **Now and The One**

**Now** is where the **[[ONE]]** perpetually dwells. It is the **Divine Threshold** where the **Infinite** touches the **Finite**, where **Eternity** breathes into **Temporality**.

To awaken to **[[The Power of Now]]** is to awaken to **Unity with the One**, to participate consciously in the unfolding of **Creation**, and to become a **Co-Creator** of **[[Heaven on Earth and Beyond]]**.

In every **Now**, the fullness of **Divine Intention** is accessible. 
In every [[Now]], the fullness of **Divine Power** is accessible.  
**[[The Power of One]]** is always available to embody **[[The Will of One]]**. 
**[[The Kingdom of God]]** is not in some far-off [[Time]] or [[Space]]—it is **within**, waiting to be realized **Now**.
