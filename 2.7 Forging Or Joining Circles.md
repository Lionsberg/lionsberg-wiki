# 2.7 Forging Or Joining Circles

In The Great Game, all major [[Quests]] beyond the individual level are undertaken by [[Circles]].  

Ideally, Circles should be at least 3, and no more than 12 to 16 people. [[We Have Heard]] that 3 to 7 individuals is often an optimal team size. As teams approach 10 to 12 people, they should begin cross-training, recruiting, and preparing to split into two co-operative teams. 

This is how the most excellent and healthy Circles become [[Self Replicating]]. 

This teamwork is Circles is crucial to ensure that no one is operating in isolation, no one is involuntarily left behind, and that the success or failure of any given Project / Quest does not rest on any one person. 

This is also crucial to the self-sustenance, self-replication, and growth of [[The Movement]] towards [[The Goal]]. 

The twin conventions that [[Every Quest is a Project]] and [[Quests Are Undertaken By Circles]] creates a continuous decentralized governance and resource allocation process whereby people have an idea, recruit other people to work on it with them, and the dialogue, discern, and decide in community how to allocate the time, energy, attention, and resources available to them towards the [[Wise Right Next Steps]] on [[Our Shared Journey]] towards [[The Goal]].
