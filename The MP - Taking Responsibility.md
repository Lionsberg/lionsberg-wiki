# The MP - Taking Responsibility

Fortunately, some *were* doing something. Deep underground and invisible to most, a growing network had been laying foundations, forging strategies, and making plans for an unprecedented [[Citizen Led]] response to the [[Meta Crisis]]. 

It all began to change when the [[Citizens]] of Earth realized that if the existing order were to collapse, and their children were found suffering, there would be no one to blame. 

Memes began circulating, such as ""[[There Is No Them]] coming to save us", and "[[We Are The Ones We Have Been Waiting For]]". 

These led a growing number of citizens to begin to see the [[Wisdom]] in treating Earth as a [[Zero Blame Environment]]. This forced them to begin to [[Act As If]] it were their responsibility to confront and overcome the [[Meta Crisis]], and forge a Better Future from its ashes.
