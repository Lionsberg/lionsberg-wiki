# Incarnate

In the context of Lionsberg, "Incarnate" refers to the embodiment or manifestation of an aspect of [[Metaphysical Reality]] into [[Physical Reality]]. 

For instance, in the context of the Lionsberg System it would refer to the attempt to: 
1. Discern, Discover, and Search Out the Wisdom, Principles, and Values of [[God]]   
2. Understand those as a Uniting Spirit  
3. Differentiate the essential [[Pattern Language]] of the Spirit  
4. Embody the [[Pattern Language]] via a System and Prototype extant in [[Metaphysical Reality]]  
5. Ensure that the [[Pattern Language]] matched, as closely as possible, the [[Metaphysical DNA]] of [[The Golden Seed]]  
6. Then embody or manifest the Patterns of The System and its Vision, Intention, Principles, and Values into tangible, real-world actions via [[Instantiation]].  

It encompasses a process of [[Progressive Articulation]] and [[Progressive Realization]] through which the Spirit, abstract ideals and theoretical frameworks of The System and The Prototype are brought to life through practical implementation in individual thought, word, and action, organizational structures, community practices, and [[New]] societal norms. 

"Incarnate" implies that the core Spirit and Tenants of The Lionsberg System are not merely conceptual but actively expressed and realized in the physical world, influencing and transforming the way humanity interacts with itself and the environment. 

It signifies a transition from [[Spirit]] to ideas to action, emphasizing the importance of living out the system's values and [[Way of Being]] in everyday life, thus fostering a global shift towards a harmonious and eternally regenerative future.
