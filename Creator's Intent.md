# Creator's Intent

In the Lionsberg System, Creator's Intent is a [[Limit Statement]] to concisely represent the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for All beings without exception. 

If you are agnostic about the Source and Sustainer of Life you might think of this in terms of the highest thing you can conceive of and relate to, perhaps the logic and intention of the entire [[Living System]].
