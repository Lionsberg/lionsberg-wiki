# Creator's Intent

In the Lionsberg System, Creator's Intent is a [[Limit Statement]] to concisely represent the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] for All beings without exception. 

It can propositionally be understood as [[Absolute And Unconditional Love]]. 

For those who are agnostic about the Source and Sustainer of Life, one might think of this in terms of the [[Highest Intention and Greatest Good]] one can conceive of and relate to, for example the logic and intention of the entire [[Living System]].
