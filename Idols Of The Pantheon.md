# Idols Of The Pantheon

In the [[LIONSBERG System]], [[Idols Of The Pantheon]] is used as a [[Word Tool]] to point to and personify the total set of [[Primordial Drives]] or [[Motivational States]] latent in humanity. 

These include basic drives such as: 

- Fear  
- Agression  
- Sexuality  
- Curiosity 
- Interest  
- Anxiety  
- Happiness  
- 

To observe these basic motivations / drives, you can look to the gods present in any culture's pantheon. 

You can also watch two year olds, who tend to cycle through the motivational states, with whichever state is possessing them possessing them 100%. 

These [[Motivational States]] animate, energize, drive towards specific goals, persist until the goal is achieved, and vary in relative strength based on [[State Of Embodiment]] and [[State Of Environment]].  

The basic aspect of development is the integration of these drives into [[Higher Order Functional Unity]] in a [[Whole]] [[Personality]] moving towards a [[Meta Goal]].  

This requires modulating the innate lower order drives relative to an abstract higher order goal or representation.
