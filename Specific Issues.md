# Specific Issues

The total set of problems, needs, issues and opportunities generally inherent in any human endeavor can be generally classified as [[General Problems]], [[General Needs]], [[General Issues]], and [[General Opportunities]]. 

Occasionally, there is a very unique problem, need, issue or opportunity that is uniquely specific to a [[Time]] and [[Space]]. These can be called [[Specific Problems]] / [[Specific Needs]] /  [[Specific Issues]], and [[Specific Opportunities]]. 

In the [[Lionsberg System]], [[Specific Issues]] are solved Locally in [[Small Groups]].
