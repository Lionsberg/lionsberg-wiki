# Complex

Complex systems are fundamentally different from complicated systems in that they involve numerous interacting components whose relationships are neither fixed nor easily discernible. This results in emergent behaviors that cannot be predicted solely by understanding the constituent parts. Complexity requires a multi-disciplinary, systems thinking approach to grasp the nuances and inherent unpredictability of outcomes. In the Lionsberg System, the notion of complexity underpins the adaptive and participatory governance models that aim to address societal challenges holistically.

In the [[Lionsberg Lexicon]], this [[Word Tool]] can be considered alongside others such as [[Complicated]], [[Chaotic]], [[Adaptive]], [[Emergence]], [[Resilience]], and [[Anti-Fragility]].
