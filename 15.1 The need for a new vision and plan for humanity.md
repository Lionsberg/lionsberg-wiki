# 15.1 The need for a new vision and plan for humanity

It is clear that humanity is facing a Meta Crisis, an unprecedented challenge that requires a comprehensive and cohesive response in order to be effectively addressed. The current systems, institutions, and approaches that we have relied on in the past have proven to be inadequate in addressing this crisis, and it is time for us to come together and create a New Vision and Plan that will guide us towards a better future.

This [[New Vision and Plan]] must be based on principles and values that prioritize the well-being of all people and the health of our planet. It must have ambitious and measurable goals that address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and help prevent future crises from occurring. And it must have strategies that are effective, efficient, and just in their implementation.

The New Vision and Plan must be comprehensive in its scope and scale, addressing all of the key issues that contribute to the Meta Crisis, including economic justice and reform, social justice and reform, environmental justice and reform, governance and political reform, development and wellbeing justice and reform, energy justice and reform, and infrastructure justice and reform.

The impact of this New Vision and Plan has the potential to be profound and far-reaching, creating a better future for humanity and all life on Earth. It has the potential to address the root causes of the Meta Crisis and prevent future crises from occurring. And it has the potential to create a more sustainable, just, and harmonious world. The time has come for us to come together and make this vision a reality.
