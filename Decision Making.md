# Decision Making

[[Participants]] in the System have the Right and Responsibility to engage in the [[Governance]] and [[Decision Making]] of the Groups they Participate in, and to ensure that the Individual and Local Governance aligns with and supports the Governance of the Whole. 

Decision making is rooted in the belief that each Individual has a spark of the Divine and an inner guide, and is therefore both equipped and qualified to Govern them Selves, and Participate in the Self Governance of their Circles and the Whole. 

As a starting point, the [[LIONSBERG System]] recommends that [[Decisions]] are made on the basis of [[Discernment]] and [[Consent]] around [[Proposals]].
